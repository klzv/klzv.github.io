        <p></p>sparklingly radiant, but gentle and kind, the sort that had real warmth and affection<p></p>
        in it.<p></p>
        As she gave him a look filled with such brightness and emotion, Amane gulped loudly.<p></p>
        "…I made a promise, so…"<p></p>
        "Yes, you did."<p></p>
        Mahiru's face melted into a broad smile at Amane's affirmation. Her expression<p></p>
        seemed dazzling and vibrant, different from the calm in her eyes, and he found that he<p></p>
        couldn't look away from her.<p></p>
        As though from somewhere far away, Amane felt his heart pounding hard as he tried<p></p>
        to sear the image of her smile into his memory.<p></p>
        "So that's why I don't have to get too worked up about anything. I'm not going to go<p></p>
        out of my way to change how I act at school, and I'm not going to worry too much<p></p>
        about it, either. It's all right, because I've got someone who sees me for who I am and<p></p>
        accepts me."<p></p>
        "…I see."<p></p>
        Because Amane had discovered the real Mahiru who had been huddled up inside, and<p></p>
        he was looking at her for who she was.<p></p>
        That was what let her stay calm.<p></p>
        Overwhelming feelings of joy and love welled up inside him, tickling his chest.<p></p>
        But a small lump also formed there, blocking that feeling just a little bit.<p></p>
        "…You look sort of dissatisfied, don't you?"<p></p>
        Mahiru had noticed that something was bothering Amane and turned to him with a<p></p>
        troubled, anxious look on her face. He couldn't say for sure that it was dissatisfaction<p></p>
        he was feeling, though.<p></p>
        "N-no, it makes me happy that you've started feeling that way. I think it's a great thing.<p></p>
        But it's just, well, I've just… got some thoughts."<p></p>
        "What is it? Tell me now."<p></p>
        "Ah, no, it's—"<p></p>
        "I'm not going to get mad or anything! I can't even imagine you saying anything to hurt<p></p>
        me."<p></p>
        The pressure of her eyes staring directly at him was enough to tell him he wouldn't<p></p>
        have the chance to refuse.<p></p>
        After all, Amane had also said some things that could be misinterpreted, and knew he<p></p>
        should explain himself, but—<p></p>
        He also believed that if he put what he was feeling into words, he might be setting<p></p>
        himself up to be teased for his immature emotions.<p></p>
        "Fine. D-don't laugh, okay?"<p></p>
        There was no way that he was going to get out of telling her, so he tried to warn her<p></p>
        first, and she nodded obediently. He found it unbearable to look at her directly, so<p></p>
        Amane averted his eyes somewhat from Mahiru and opened his mouth to continue.<p></p>
        "Now, you said you wouldn't get worked up…"<p></p>
        "Right," she answered.<p></p>
        "The thing is, sometimes you let your guard down and show your real self without<p></p>
        meaning to…" He made it that far, then hesitated to say any more, but it was too late to<p></p>
        stop, so Amane took a deep breath. His lip quivered as he carried on. "…And when I<p></p>
        think about another guy seeing you like that… I dunno, it makes me feel… conflicted."<p></p>
        He paused for a moment before reaching the conclusion of that thought, because he<p></p>
        knew right away how childish he sounded.<p></p>
        He was glad that Mahiru had accepted herself and was starting to change the way she<p></p>
        thought about things, and he was happy that she had extended a hand to him, after<p></p>
        spending many years wearing the same protective shell.<p></p>
        He was also happy that she had placed her wholehearted trust in him.<p></p>
        And he was overjoyed that she seemed to be coming to feel that she could be herself,<p></p>
        without keeping up false appearances.<p></p>
        He should have had no complaints, and yet he hated the idea of Mahiru—this<p></p>
        completely ordinary, sensitive girl, who always worked hard despite difficult<p></p>
        circumstances, who got lonely with surprising ease and was bad at depending on<p></p>
        others because she tended to put on a show of courage—he hated the idea of all the<p></p>
        other students at school getting to see that girl.<p></p>
        I know that it's just possessiveness and jealousy making me feel like this.<p></p>
        But that was what he truly felt, despite knowing that she didn't belong to him and that<p></p>
        he had no right to feel the way he did.<p></p>
        "L-look, I know that this sounds presumptuous, and that you'll probably want to tell<p></p>
        me off, but—"<p></p>
        Amane pursed his lips in self-derision, marveling at how shamefully pathetic he must<p></p>
        be. Mahiru looked at him, blinking her round, cute eyes in surprise, clearly taken<p></p>
        aback. Gradually, both corners of her lips started to curve upward.<p></p>
        By the time Amane noticed, she was already grinning, and her demeanor had changed<p></p>
        to something warm and cheerful.<p></p>
        "I—I thought I told you not to laugh!"<p></p>
        "Heh-heh, sorry!"<p></p>
        When Mahiru apologized with a wide, defenseless, cherubic smile completely free of<p></p>
        any ill will, it was all Amane could do to catch his breath. He couldn't offer any further<p></p>
        complaints.<p></p>
        It was a different type from the one she'd been wearing before, an expression in her<p></p>
        eyes of pure joy and affection that surpassed anything he had seen. It left Amane<p></p>
        speechless.<p></p>
        Mahiru let her smile drop just a little bit and fixed her eyes on Amane again. "…You<p></p>
        don't have to worry, Amane, I'm not going to show anyone else the kind of faces I show<p></p>
        you. There's no way I would feel comfortable enough with people I'm not close with."<p></p>
        "I—I see."<p></p>
        Amane was understandably relieved and became keenly aware that his emotions were<p></p>
        plainly visible on his face.<p></p>
        Usually, he was better at hiding his feelings, but when it came to Mahiru, no matter<p></p>
        what he did, the things he tried to conceal showed up on the surface.<p></p>
        "…You're such a cutie, Amane," Mahiru said, while smiling like something was funny.<p></p>
        Amane bit the inside of his cheek and squeezed, keeping his facial muscles locked in<p></p>
        place. "Stop that. You're making fun of me, aren't you?"<p></p>
        "I mean it," she insisted.<p></p>
        "That's uncalled for; quit it."<p></p>
        "You quit it, stop showing me such a cute side of you."<p></p>
        "I'm going to have to challenge that. I mean, what about me could possibly be<p></p>
        considered cute? And why would you say that to a guy?"<p></p>
        As someone who prided himself on shedding all his adorable traits, Amane didn't have<p></p>
        a clue what she meant.<p></p>
        Women and children could accept the word as a compliment, but Amane was a guy<p></p>
        and had no desire to be cute, so he could only take it as simple teasing.<p></p>
        He frowned and protested with his eyes, but Mahiru let out a little giggle that told him<p></p>
        her evaluation wasn't going to waver.<p></p>
        "Everything about you is endearing."<p></p>
        "I can't trust it when a girl says that, and I don't agree."<p></p>
        "What an awful thing to say. Well, you have to understand the fact that a girl's<p></p>
        definition of cute isn't just based on appearances but is more a sign of whether she<p></p>
        finds something likable in a broader sense… That's why you're definitely cute,<p></p>
        Amane!"<p></p>
        "Guys aren't happy about being called that, you know."<p></p>
        He did not appreciate the girl he liked choosing this way to compliment him.<p></p>
        Nonetheless, he was happy about the fact that she was praising him, but Amane would<p></p>
        never call a guy like himself adorable.<p></p>
        He thought about asking her why she thought he'd be happy that she called him cute,<p></p>
        but he got the feeling that she hadn't been trying to compliment him specifically so<p></p>
        much as just to state her own opinion, so there didn't seem to be any point.<p></p>
        Amane pressed his lips together tightly and looked at Mahiru, but she was still smiling<p></p>
        joyously. If he hadn't been able to see the affection in her eyes, he probably would have<p></p>
        pinched her cheeks right then.<p></p>
        "…Is there nothing attractive about me?" Amane grumbled quietly, without meaning<p></p>
        to.<p></p>
        Mahiru stiffened up and fixed her eyes on him, which made him immediately regret<p></p>
        his words.<p></p>
        Even for a pitiful loser like Amane, begging for compliments was too much. Anyway,<p></p>
        there was no chance that Mahiru thought of him as someone who was cool when he<p></p>
        had been told by plenty of other people that he was a lazy, pathetic late bloomer.<p></p>
        Amane averted his eyes, concluding that it was a mistake to even expect such words<p></p>
        from her. But Mahiru did not look away.<p></p>
        "You are attractive."<p></p>
        Amane couldn't believe his ears when he heard these clearly enunciated words.<p></p>
        "To be honest, you are cute, but you're also cool. More than anyone else, in my eyes."<p></p>
        "…You don't have to force yourself to flatter me."<p></p>
        "How rude. What would I get out of lying to you? I'm just saying what I think."<p></p>
        "…You're overstating it, and you have no taste in men."<p></p>
        Amane was working on becoming a better version of himself, but he didn't think he<p></p>
        was especially desirable. So even when Mahiru praised him, he couldn't let himself<p></p>
        believe her. Especially after she went on and on about how he was cute.<p></p>
        "So what is your definition of 'cool,' Amane?"<p></p>
        Amane was frowning, and Mahiru gently gazed at him.<p></p>
        "For me, I think to view a guy as charming, you need to take everything about his<p></p>
        personality into account, from the aura around him, to how he carries himself, to his<p></p>
        words, actions, and expressions. Thinking that attractiveness is only a matter of<p></p>
        appearance seems very superficial to me."<p></p>
        "W-well, that's true, but—"<p></p>
        "Looking at you objectively, I wouldn't say you're handsome enough to captivate<p></p>
        everyone who looks at you. But your face is well-proportioned, and like I said before,<p></p>
        appearances aren't the only thing that make someone appealing. You're maybe a little<p></p>
        sarcastic, but you're always polite, and you're well-mannered and gentlemanly and<p></p>
        kind. You're always reaching out to those in need even though you put on a show of<p></p>
        being cold and distant. You're cautious, but you're dependable when you need to be.<p></p>
        Looking at you all together, you are attractive, Amane. Of course, I can't deny that my<p></p>
        subjective opinion and personal preferences factor into that assessment, but you're<p></p>
        very cool, so please have a little more confidence."<p></p>
        "Th-that's enough, I get it, I hear you, so—"<p></p>
        "You don't get it. You don't have any self-confidence, so if I don't get serious and tell<p></p>
        you—"<p></p>
        "I said that's enough!"<p></p>
        Mahiru had gotten more insistent as she spoke, and before she even finished, Amane<p></p>
        had found himself groaning with embarrassment. If Mahiru flattered him any further,<p></p>
        he felt like he would burst into tears of shame, so he had to do something to stop her<p></p>
        from continuing to list his various merits. He took a deep breath to try to somehow<p></p>
        calm his heart, which was sending heat radiating up to his face, as if he wasn't<p></p>
        embarrassed enough already. He felt like his cheeks probably looked as red as ripe<p></p>
        apples, and that even Mahiru, who had just been praising him, would find it pathetic.<p></p>
        The fact that Mahiru held Amane in high regard had somehow sunk in—it was clear<p></p>
        to him, so he didn't need her to continue in any more detail. Her compliments only<p></p>
        made him heartsick. He felt such joy and shame at the idea that she valued him at all<p></p>
        that he couldn't stand to be there any longer. He wanted to run away.<p></p>
        Amane's eyes darted around as he desperately tried to shake off the heat and<p></p>
        humiliation that had overtaken his body.<p></p>
        Mahiru looked at him and smiled broadly, obviously delighted. "…That is what's so cute<p></p>
        about you, Amane."<p></p>
        It was a little late, but Amane finally understood what Mahiru was trying to say. He<p></p>
        glared at her; his face still flushed red.<p></p>
        "If you try to say anything more, I'll have to stop you somehow."<p></p>
        "…Oh, and how will you do that?"<p></p>
        "What do you mean, how? I'll manage, I'm sure."<p></p>
        "Well, you don't scare me one bit."<p></p>
        Mahiru didn't look like she was going to restrain herself. Still smiling, she gently<p></p>
        reached out toward Amane's face.<p></p>
        He could feel Mahiru's chilly fingers pressingagainst his feverish cheeks. Gently, she<p></p>
        turned his face so that he was looking directly at her.<p></p>
        "…No matter what you say, even if you don't think it's true, to me, you are attractive,<p></p>
        Amane. You don't have to worry about it; I can see all the best parts of you."<p></p>
        She was very close to him, and her voice was bright like the rays of the spring sun,<p></p>
        refreshing and clear. Her words slowly caressed his heart as she softly praised him.<p></p>
        The warmth and affection in her caramel-coloured eyes took his breath away, as they<p></p>
        reflected him and him alone.<p></p>
        …I can't…<p></p>
        Amane felt a heat that he'd never experienced before. He couldn't so much as manage<p></p>
        a groan, or even to avert his eyes. He just stood there, basking in Mahiru's radiance.<p></p>
        Then, suddenly, Mahiru's smile changed to something much softer.<p></p>
        "You're adorable." 2<p></p>
        The moment he heard her sweetly whisper, a pleasant tingle ran up his spine, and the<p></p>
        warmth heating Amane's whole body grew even stronger under Mahiru's gaze.<p></p>
        Before he realized it, he had grasped her delicate fingers and taken them off his cheek,<p></p>
        and in a single, smooth movement, had pressed Mahiru against the back of the couch,<p></p>
        bringing his face very close to hers.<p></p>
        There was only a palm's breadth of distance between them.<p></p>
        Amane had kept his word, closing Mahiru's mouth shut with his hand against her lips<p></p>
        as he stared down at her.<p></p>
        The caramel-coloured eyes peeking through long eyelashes that almost looked like a<p></p>
        hazy curtain were open wide in surprise.<p></p>
        That was close, Amane thought.<p></p>
        If she had looked at him with those eyes, if she had stirred him up any further, he might<p></p>
        have lost all restraint for a moment. If he didn't exert the small amount of self-control<p></p>
        he had in order to stop her, they both would have given up their first kiss.<p></p>
        As much as he would have liked to keep going and gradually chip away at those "firsts,"<p></p>
        Amane was brought back to reality by the urgent alarm bells of reason ringing in his<p></p>
        head. He was grateful that he had chosen a course of action that he wouldn't regret<p></p>
        later.<p></p>
        Mahiru, who had been calm and collected until a moment prior, stiffened when he<p></p>
        touched her lips, and a light crimson color spread over her cheeks in an instant.<p></p>
        Amane smirked when he saw that she hadn't gotten any better at dealing with sudden<p></p>
        surprises. Slowly, he lifted his hand from her lips.<p></p>
        They were still close enough that if he'd wiggled his fingers a little, they'd have<p></p>
        brushed her face, but instead of pulling back a little, he slowly put his lips near her ear<p></p>
        and whispered, "…If you say something like that again, I'll pull my hand away, and<p></p>
        really shut your mouth." 2<p></p>
        Though he couldn't see her face, Amane could feel Mahiru shudder.<p></p>
        However, she didn't push him away or try to block him. Feeling relieved, Amane<p></p>
        gradually backed away. He was suddenly embarrassed at how much he wanted to see<p></p>
        Mahiru's face, and he guiltily looked away.<p></p>
        In fact, he was already feeling intensely ashamed over his sudden, reckless boldness,<p></p>
        and he moved to rise from the sofa. He knew that he wasn't thinking straight, and that<p></p>
        what he needed was to get some actual, physical distance from her for a moment.<p></p>
        But when he started to stand, he felt some resistance. He looked down to where he felt<p></p>
        something pulling on him, then the next moment, a sweet smell filled his nose.<p></p>
        In the blink of an eye, threads of shimmering gold danced past him, and he felt<p></p>
        something soft graze one of his still-flushed cheeks.<p></p>
        Then he heard the sound of slippers on the floor and the echo of footsteps that were<p></p>
        wilder and more restless than they were nimble. Mahiru was gone, and it was like<p></p>
        everything he had just felt had been an illusion.<p></p>
        He recognized the bang of his front door slamming shut, and Amane brought his hand<p></p>
        to the cheek where something soft had touched it. 2<p></p>
        "—Why?" he mumbled, but naturally there was no answer.<p></p>
        Sapped of all energy, spirit, and composure, Amane sunk down into the sofa and stared<p></p>
        down the hallway where the flaxen whirlwind had disappeared.<p></p>
        Mahiru did not return to Amane's apartment for the rest of the day<p></p>
        Chapter 51: Pretending Not to See, Pretending Not to Know
        <section id="51"></section>
        <p></p>What was it that had touched his cheek?
        <p></p>After it happened, Mahiru did not return to Amane's apartment. He did not see her for
        <p></p>the rest of the day. Except for when he was sleeping—to be accurate, he had been too
        <p></p>distressed for to sleep, but he'd dozed off a few times—any time he wasn't, he was
        <p></p>turning over Mahiru's actions in his mind.
        <p></p>It had only been for a moment, brief enough to make him question whether it had been
        <p></p>his imagination—but something soft had definitely grazed his cheek. Knowing how
        <p></p>close she'd been to him at the time, and remembering the feel of it, Amane could guess
        <p></p>what Mahiru had done. But that didn't mean he understood it.
        <p></p>No one would ever have imagined it, that Mahiru herself would kiss him, even if it was
        <p></p>just his cheek.
        <p></p>…Why? 1
        <p></p>Typically, a kiss is something only shared with someone close or important. Amane
        <p></p>wanted to tell Mahiru how precious she was to him, but his last attempt had gone so
        <p></p>poorly that he was embarrassed just thinking about it.
        <p></p>There was really no excuse—he hadn't even tried to make a move. However, Mahiru
        <p></p>was different. Even if it was only his cheek, she had really kissed him.
        <p></p>He understood that she cared about him, liked him even, and treated him well. But
        <p></p>confronted with her feelings in the form of a kiss, Amane was left more bewildered
        <p></p>than elated.
        <p></p>I wonder if she's starting to really like me? 12
        <p></p>Amane felt like he'd never gotten the chance to really impress her, like she'd only ever
        <p></p>seen what a worthless person he was. He couldn't think of any reason why she would 3
        <p></p>like him.
        <p></p>The notion that nobody could ever fall for him, and that he was an arrogant fool for
        <p></p>hoping, spun round and round in Amane's head, making it hard to think about
        <p></p>anything else.
        <p></p>At school, he kept his mess of emotions from showing on his face, but inside, he was
        <p></p>miserably distressed.
        <p></p>Whenever Mahiru made eye contact with Amane during school, she would turn her
        <p></p>gaze away subtly, so he also avoided looking in her direction.
        <p></p>Nevertheless, Amane's eyes followed Mahiru whenever possible, and the everperceptive Itsuki must have
        noticed the small distance that had opened between
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Did the two of you get into a fight?" Itsuki asked over lunch.
        <p></p>"Huh? You had a fight, Fujimiya?" Yuuta asked.
        <p></p>Chitose and Mahiru weren't joining them that day, so the three boys were having lunch
        <p></p>together.
        <p></p>"No, we're not fighting, but… well, um, something, some things happened…"
        <p></p>He mumbled those words and avoided going into detail. Amane couldn't possibly
        <p></p>explain that he had completely failed to kiss Mahiru, and that she had kissed him on
        <p></p>the cheek instead.
        <p></p>Itsuki did not hide his exasperation. He gave Amane a look that said, "You better give
        <p></p>up and confess everything if you know what's good for you."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't meet his friend's gaze. "Anyway…," he muttered, "some things
        <p></p>happened, and we're both feeling self-conscious about it, or like…"
        <p></p>"Unbelievable, just how much of a wuss are you?"
        <p></p>"Shut up, man."
        <p></p>"Now, now, Fujimiya strikes me as the cautious type," Yuuta interjected. "I doubt he
        <p></p>can make an approach without a painfully obvious signal telling him to go for it." 6
        <p></p>"That's what I mean; he always chickens out!" 1
        <p></p>There was no way Itsuki and Yuuta could understand what had happened, but the two
        <p></p>of them didn't hold back, and their accusations at Amane for "chickening out" stung
        <p></p>quite a bit.
        <p></p>"…It's just, the idea of someone liking me—like, if I was more self-confident, this
        <p></p>wouldn't be so hard, and… If I was better-looking, I would feel more confident, but…"
        <p></p>"Fujimiya, if anything, you're a high-quality guy who acts like a loser despite
        <p></p>everything you've got going for you."
        <p></p>"I don't know what to do with that, coming from you, Kadowaki, the cre me de la 3
        <p></p>cre me."
        <p></p>If Amane had been as accomplished as Yuuta, and had good looks to boot, he wouldn't
        <p></p>have struggled so much. He might have been able to accept Mahiru's affection without
        <p></p>a second thought and confess his feelings for her. He would have been able to stand
        <p></p>proudly by her side, without having to work for it.
        <p></p>He understood that Mahiru had been sincere when she'd said that he was attractive,
        <p></p>but objective and subjective opinions were two very different things.
        <p></p>Mahiru's subjective opinion was the most important, of course, but when he thought
        <p></p>about all their peers watching, as well as his own self-worth, he felt like he had a lot of
        <p></p>improvement left to make.
        <p></p>"I'm not saying that I'm jealous of your looks, Kadowaki, but if I had those going for
        <p></p>me, I'm sure I would be more confident."
        <p></p>Amane's hesitation and anxiety were his own fault. It was the fear of reaching out to
        <p></p>her that kept him stuck, worrying over answers that he might never even get, all
        <p></p>because he lacked any kind of mental fortitude.
        <p></p>"It's a little late, but you need to have some faith in yourself and make a move!"
        <p></p>"I told you, I'm working on it now. I'm gonna make a move soon, but…"
        <p></p>Amane was working on building up his confidence. He was working hard in school by
        <p></p>being diligent with his studies so that he could maintain his position in the top ten.
        <p></p>Amane had a good memory and learned new things easily, so he counted himself lucky
        <p></p>that he could keep up his grades without working too hard. After that, he just had to
        <p></p>keep raising the bar.
        <p></p>The problem was going to be exercise.
        <p></p>Amane wished he had some sort of athletic prowess, like Yuuta for example. But he 2
        <p></p>was just average. If anything, he was a bit of a bookworm, so he wasn't expecting to
        <p></p>accomplish anything amazing.
        <p></p>He'd been exercising in order to look better, even just a little, and to improve his health
        <p></p>and self-confidence. However, he had been focusing on physical fitness and not doing
        <p></p>the sort of training that one needed to excel at any particular sport.
        <p></p>Amane was feeling down about himself, musing that if only he were a bit more athletic,
        <p></p>he might be able to play a more active role in the following month's Sports Day events.
        <p></p>"Leaving aside what just happened, I'm going to do my best and proceed at my own
        <p></p>pace, so please don't rush me too much."
        <p></p>"Okay, if that's what you really want," Yuuta agreed. "But… we're getting impatient 1
        <p></p>watching you, you know."
        <p></p>Itsuki grinned. "Speaking of which, when do we convene the next meeting of the 'kick
        <p></p>Amane's butt into gear' club?"
        <p></p>Amane's cheek twitched at the idea that the two of them were planning something.
        <p></p>"Seriously, what have you guys got up your sleeves?"
        <p></p>Yuuta only shrugged and smiled and said uneasily, "Look, we just mean that we're
        <p></p>rooting for you, so…"
        <p></p>Amane spent the whole day at school worrying about the true meaning behind
        <p></p>Mahiru's kiss. Then, after heading home, he waited for her in his apartment, growing
        <p></p>ever more anxious.
        <p></p>Mahiru had responded as soon as he messaged her asking if she was coming over, so
        <p></p>he knew she was on her way, but Amane felt quite nervous about it.
        <p></p>It would be their first time talking since the events of the day before, and the strain
        <p></p>was making Amane's heart and stomach ache.
        <p></p>He was practically writhing in pain on the sofa, too focused on the sound of the ticking
        <p></p>clock as he waited for her, when he finally heard the lock in his front door turn.
        <p></p>Amane felt himself jump at the noise, but he knew that if he showed any agitation,
        <p></p>Mahiru would get agitated, too. They wouldn't be able to talk, so he did what he could
        <p></p>to suppress his nervousness. Taking deep breaths, Amane waited for her to approach,
        <p></p>and eventually, she appeared before him.
        <p></p>Though he felt somewhat hesitant, he looked up and saw Mahiru, who had changed
        <p></p>into her regular clothes, standing there as always… no, standing there with slightly
        <p></p>pink cheeks, as her eyes darted around nervously.
        <p></p>"…Um, I'm sorry about yesterday," she said. "About leaving before dinner."
        <p></p>"Oh, no, I'm not worried about that, so…," he answered awkwardly.
        <p></p>With stiff movements, like a machine that needed oil, Mahiru took a seat beside him
        <p></p>on the sofa.
        <p></p>Even though she sat next to him like usual, he noticed that she was sitting on the very
        <p></p>edge of the couch, as if trying to keep her distance from Amane, and hugging a cushion.
        <p></p>She looked as uncomfortable as he felt.
        <p></p>It was a little lonely to have her so far away after he'd gotten used to her sitting right
        <p></p>beside him, but on the other hand, he felt relieved to have some distance between
        <p></p>them.
        <p></p>"So about that thing… the thing that happened yesterday…"
        <p></p>After a brief silence, Mahiru broached the topic hesitantly, shaking so much that her
        <p></p>long flaxen hair formed undulating waves of gold.
        <p></p>"…Uhh, M-Mahiru… why, why did you do that?"
        <p></p>Amane knew he was being vague, but he was too nervous to ask the question he really
        <p></p>wanted to ask, so he tried to probe indirectly.
        <p></p>In response to Amane's timid inquiry, Mahiru pursed her lips and looked at him. Her
        <p></p>eyes were cloudy, and she looked dissatisfied, and then began to speak slowly.
        <p></p>"I—I just got caught up in the moment. Or maybe… it was revenge."
        <p></p>"Revenge?"
        <p></p>"I mean, you're the one who started it, aren't you?"
        <p></p>"A-ah, well, maybe that's true, but…"
        <p></p>The big difference was that he hadn't gone all the way, whereas Mahiru had actually
        <p></p>kissed him. But Amane was worried she might retreat if he pointed that out, so he
        <p></p>swallowed his words.
        <p></p>"Well then, I had the right to do it, too, didn't I?"
        <p></p>"…That's not the issue. Um…"
        <p></p>Are you glad that you kissed me, even if it was on the cheek?
        <p></p>If he could only have asked her directly, his worries would have ended right there.
        <p></p>He knew for certain that Mahiru hadn't avoided the… thing he'd almost done. That she
        <p></p>didn't hate the thought of kissing him, either.
        <p></p>The only piece of information missing was how she really felt about it.
        <p></p>It was not impossible for Amane to guess what the answer might be. Only, he was
        <p></p>afraid of outright rejection and couldn't bring himself to ask.
        <p></p>I'm so pathetic. 6
        <p></p>As Amane groaned to himself about how sad and hopeless he felt, he noticed that
        <p></p>Mahiru was blushing faintly. She saw him looking and stared right back at him.
        <p></p>"What is it?" she asked.
        <p></p>"…Nothing," was his only response.
        <p></p>Then Amane turned away so that he couldn't see her anymore.

        <p></p>Chapter 52: Sports Day Preparations and New Friends
        <p></p>"Aww, I'm on the red team!" Chitose whined mournfully when she saw the
        <p></p>announcement about the upcoming Sports Day.
        <p></p>Itsuki had already seen the results and knew that he had been assigned the white
        <p></p>team, making them opponents for once. "If they're going to the trouble of dividing us
        <p></p>up, they could have at least put us on the teams that match our names…" He groaned.
        <p></p>"Either way, you'd still be on different teams," Yuuta reminded him.
        <p></p>Itsuki's surname was Akazawa, which contained the character for red, and Chitose's
        <p></p>was Shirakawa, which contained the character for white. At school, they were
        <p></p>sometimes called the "red and white couple."
        <p></p>"That's true… it's really tragic… a forbidden love, two people drawn to each other
        <p></p>despite being on opposing sides…"
        <p></p>Not bothering to hide his exasperation at the two who were lamenting their fates as
        <p></p>yet another way to flirt with each other, Amane gazed at the paper that showed how
        <p></p>the students were divided up.
        <p></p>Amane was on the red team with Yuuta and Chitose, while Itsuki and Mahiru had been
        <p></p>assigned to the white team. Although that meant Amane would be with the track and
        <p></p>field ace, it appeared that the opposing side included more members from the school
        <p></p>sports clubs overall.
        <p></p>Amane didn't particularly care whether his team won or lost, but he did want to put
        <p></p>on a good show for Mahiru.
        <p></p>"What events do you want, Amane?" Itsuki asked when he'd finished flirting with
        <p></p>Chitose.
        <p></p>He and Chitose were on the class's Sports Day executive committee together. It was
        <p></p>exactly the sort of thing that a popular, energetic guy like Itsuki would sign up for. He
        <p></p>was famous for avoiding putting too much effort into anything, which confused Amane
        <p></p>as to why his friend took on so many class leadership roles.
        <p></p>"What events are there, again?"
        <p></p>"The events left are the sprints, relays, obstacle course, scavenger hunt, three-legged
        <p></p>race, ball toss, and tug-of-war. I'm guessing the interclass relay isn't of much interest
        <p></p>to a member of the 'go-home club' like you."
        <p></p>"I guess the ball toss would be good."
        <p></p>"Of course you'd go for the most boring one… Well, just remember you have to do at
        <p></p>least two activities."
        <p></p>"All right, I want the ball toss and the scavenger hunt."
        <p></p>He didn't want to embarrass himself in front of Mahiru, and Amane had a feeling that
        <p></p>the relays and the sprints would be dominated by the members of the athletic clubs.
        <p></p>Itsuki, who he would normally pair up with for the three-legged race, was on the
        <p></p>opposing team, and although Amane had Yuuta, he didn't have the confidence that he
        <p></p>could keep up with him, given his strength and speed.
        <p></p>So he chose the easier events, and Itsuki put on a bitter smile.
        <p></p>"You're really going for the boring ones, huh…? But you know, depending on what
        <p></p>happens, the scavenger hunt race might be really exciting."
        <p></p>"Well, I don't do a lot of running, so…"
        <p></p>"You never change!"
        <p></p>Amane wanted to avoid any direct competition against the sports clubs and figured
        <p></p>participating in the games meant for the students in the cultural clubs was the safest
        <p></p>option.
        <p></p>"The problem is the cavalry battle with all the guys…," he said. "You're on the opposing
        <p></p>team, after all."
        <p></p>The only guys in his class who Amane was especially good friends with were Itsuki
        <p></p>and Yuuta. He figured that Yuuta might let him join his team out of pity, but even if he
        <p></p>did, Amane suspected that he would end up feeling a little isolated.
        <p></p>Since most boys would form teams with their friends, Amane, who prided himself on
        <p></p>being a wallflower, usually wasn't enthusiastic about Sports Day.
        <p></p>"Ah, if that's the problem, you should be fine."
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"Yuuta, Kazu, and Makoto said they wanted you to join them. There, speak of the
        <p></p>devils…"
        <p></p>When Amane looked to where Itsuki was pointing, he saw three boys waving their
        <p></p>hands at him. It was Kadowaki and two other boys he seldom talked to.
        <p></p>Still, Amane knew of them. They were good friends of Yuuta's, and he'd pointed them
        <p></p>out once with a smile, telling Amane, "Now that we hang out, I want you to get to know
        <p></p>my buddies."
        <p></p>One of them, the one Itsuki had called Kazu, was a serious-looking guy who was in the
        <p></p>track and field club with Yuuta, and he specialized in long-distance running. His full
        <p></p>name was Kazuya Hiiragi.
        <p></p>The other boy was Makoto Kokonoe. He had a comparatively small build and,
        <p></p>according to the girls, something of a fickle nature.
        <p></p>When Yuuta wasn't hanging out with Amane and the others, he was with them.
        <p></p>"Hey, Fujimiya! Come over here. Let's form a cavalry battle team!" In the middle of the
        <p></p>group, Yuuta was calling him over with his usual refreshing smile.
        <p></p>Amane hesitated, but Itsuki said, "Get going," and physically pushed him from the back.
        <p></p>He stumbled up to the group, and Yuuta welcomed him with another grin.
        <p></p>"You're not teamed up with anyone yet, right, Fujimiya?" Yuuta asked. "If you want,
        <p></p>we'd like you to be in our group."
        <p></p>"That's fine by me, but what about the other two guys?"
        <p></p>"I don't mind." The first one to answer was Makoto. "Yuuta and Kazuya are both tall,
        <p></p>so height-wise, we think you'd be the best addition."
        <p></p>"Ah, I see…"
        <p></p>Makoto was probably the one who was going to ride on top of everybody's shoulders,
        <p></p>so it made sense that he was looking for three people with similar statures.
        <p></p>Amane was on the tall side, not that different from Yuuta and Kazuya when they lined
        <p></p>up next to each other. Although he was much ganglier and didn't have much in the way
        <p></p>of sturdiness and resilience like the other two did.
        <p></p>"You okay with this, Hiiragi?" Yuuta asked.
        <p></p>"Yeah, isn't that why we called him over here? And also because I'm curious about him,
        <p></p>since you said you guys are friends now."
        <p></p>"Don't worry," Yuuta assured him. "Fujimiya's a good guy."
        <p></p>Kazuya stared at Amane. "Sure, your judgment is always spot-on, Yuuta. I've got no
        <p></p>reservations. That said, since it was your idea to team up with him, I won't know how
        <p></p>I feel for sure until we spend some time together."
        <p></p>Amane smiled bleakly at the questionable statement. Kazuya was still looking him
        <p></p>over, and it made him somewhat uncomfortable. That said, since he'd just entered a
        <p></p>new social group, he expected a certain amount of scrutiny.
        <p></p>"Well, welcome aboard," Hiiragi said finally.
        <p></p>It seemed like Amane had passed muster, at least enough that they weren't going to
        <p></p>turn him away. The other boys gave him mellow smiles, and Amane also smiled and
        <p></p>responded, "Happy to join the group."
        <p></p>"So I've got a question," Makoto said. "Are you close friends with Shiina, Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>At Yuuta's suggestion, the team was having a small get-together at a fast-food
        <p></p>restaurant. As he munched on his chicken nuggets, Makoto sounded like the question
        <p></p>had just occurred to him.
        <p></p>Amane quickly stuffed his face with french fries, hoping to avoid making any
        <p></p>embarrassing expressions.
        <p></p>The four of them were at a fast-food restaurant because Yuuta had wanted to discuss
        <p></p>strategies for the cavalry battle… but his main motive was to try and develop their
        <p></p>friendship.
        <p></p>Amane had never expected someone who was still a relative stranger to ask something
        <p></p>like that.
        <p></p>He shot a glance over at Yuuta and received an innocent look, so Amane figured that
        <p></p>the question must have come purely from Makoto's observations.
        <p></p>That meant Amane would need to work hard not to let anything show on his face, if
        <p></p>he could.
        <p></p>"What makes you think that?" he asked dryly.
        <p></p>"Well, the five of you, Yuuta included, are always chatting and doing stuff together. But
        <p></p>Shiina behaves sort of differently with you than with Itsuki and Yuuta."
        <p></p>"Oh, does she? I hadn't noticed at all."
        <p></p>Kazuya looked over at Amane like he hadn't expected that answer—his eyes were
        <p></p>open wide in pure surprise. "I don't think anyone has really picked up on it, either.
        <p></p>Everyone else has just been watching your little group out of simple jealousy."
        <p></p>"That's disturbing to hear…"
        <p></p>"Well, from the way you're acting, I bet I'm right."
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure how to answer Makoto's questions. The other boy's expression
        <p></p>was practically unreadable. Amane looked over at Yuuta for help, and Yuuta gave him
        <p></p>a look that said that these guys could be trusted.
        <p></p>Amane scratched his cheek as he thought it over. Makoto seemed convinced that he
        <p></p>was right, but Amane didn't want those ideas to spread much.
        <p></p>However, Yuuta seemed like a good judge of character, and Makoto's question seemed
        <p></p>to stem from pure curiosity rather than invasive prying—he didn't seem to mean
        <p></p>anything by it.
        <p></p>"…Well, I guess you could say that we're good friends."
        <p></p>"It seems like she enjoys your attention, so I guess that must be true."
        <p></p>"…Is that what it looks like?"
        <p></p>"More or less."
        <p></p>Makoto's powers of observation were truly frightening.
        <p></p>Amane decided that, rather than clumsily dodging the question, it would invite less
        <p></p>suspicion to tell a certain amount of the truth. It was probably more believable to
        <p></p>admit to the friendship.
        <p></p>"We simply happen to live in the same neighborhood, so we had the chance to talk and
        <p></p>became friendly, that's all."
        <p></p>"And you've been friends since before our second year, right?"
        <p></p>"Well… second year was when we started hanging out together at school."
        <p></p>Naturally, Amane couldn't tell him that Mahiru was his next-door neighbor, and that
        <p></p>she came over to his apartment every day and fixed his meals. Even though his answer
        <p></p>wasn't exactly accurate, he decided there only needed to be a hint of truth to it.
        <p></p>After Amane answered, Makoto looked at Yuuta. "Did you know about this?"
        <p></p>Yuuta nodded, probably figuring that there was no need to hide it now that Amane had
        <p></p>said something.
        <p></p>Makoto sighed softly. "What the heck… What fools we were."
        <p></p>"Fools?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Oh, I'm talking about myself… Yuuta, you hid this from us, didn't you?"
        <p></p>"Indeed," Yuuta answered, "because I couldn't tell you anything until Fujimiya said
        <p></p>something first. But I didn't think for a second that you and Kazuya would spread
        <p></p>rumors."
        <p></p>"Of course not," Kazuya confirmed. "I'm not gonna go out of my way to do something
        <p></p>that will make people hate me."
        <p></p>"That honesty of yours is a virtue, Kazuya." Yuuta beamed.
        <p></p>Kazuya tilted his head in confusion—he didn't seem to understand why Yuuta was
        <p></p>complimenting him for something so basic. Amane knew then that he didn't have to
        <p></p>doubt Kazuya's good intentions.
        <p></p>He did feel like he was taking a bit of a risk by sharing all this information, but he felt
        <p></p>confident that he was opening up to decent people.
        <p></p>Amane was really impressed with Kazuya, who had a reputation of being an
        <p></p>upstanding guy. He was serious in a totally different manner from Yuuta. Amane
        <p></p>understood keenly why Kazuya was one of Yuuta's best friends.
        <p></p>Kazuya also had a very good eye for people's character. As a friend and as a companion,
        <p></p>Amane doubted he had any serious shortcomings.
        <p></p>"So in other words, it would be best if I didn't tell anyone about this, right?"
        <p></p>"Well, I don't expect you to lie, but I think it would probably be best if you could
        <p></p>pretend you don't know anyway. That said, if someone were to ask about our
        <p></p>friendship, I think they're more likely to ask Itsuki or Yuuta, rather than come to you,
        <p></p>Kazuya."
        <p></p>"You're not wrong there," Yuuta chuckled quietly. Amane felt reassured by his friend's
        <p></p>remark.
        <p></p>"Anyway, if you could do that for me, I'd be very grateful," he said. "I don't want to cause
        <p></p>problems for her, after all."
        <p></p>Amane would have preferred to cover up the whole affair, and he hoped the others
        <p></p>would keep it to themselves.
        <p></p>"I'm sure she wouldn't like it if all her friends started asking her all sorts of questions,
        <p></p>either. So I want to keep it on the down low. For her sake as well as mine."
        <p></p>Amane knew that if their secret was revealed, he would be the target of a great deal of
        <p></p>jealousy, and he was prepared for that. However, Mahiru would have to answer all
        <p></p>kinds of insensitive questions. The biggest question: Why him?
        <p></p>To their classmates, Mahiru was not just a gifted student… she was almost a divine
        <p></p>being, an object of worship in their school. There would be much confusion and plenty
        <p></p>of criticism about a member of the campus nobility associating with an ordinary
        <p></p>plebeian.
        <p></p>Their curiosity might be completely rational, but they would probably make Mahiru
        <p></p>uncomfortable all the same. He recalled her saying once that she wanted to be able to
        <p></p>choose her relationships freely. And Amane was convinced that Mahiru would get
        <p></p>angry with him for embarrassing her.
        <p></p>Since he didn't want to do anything that might upset her, he'd tried to hide their
        <p></p>friendship for as long as possible.
        <p></p>…Though I get the feeling that she wants to go public…
        <p></p>Amane had suspected that recently she'd been trying to close the distance between
        <p></p>them, little by little, but had chalked it up to his imagination.
        <p></p>"Ohh, ahh…"
        <p></p>"What is it, Kokonoe?"
        <p></p>"…Never mind, I just sort of realized something. It must be hard, man."
        <p></p>Makoto was looking at Amane with a bewildered expression. Amane could only tilt his
        <p></p>head in confusion.
        <p></p>"Yuuta, is this by any chance…?" Makoto asked vaguely. 4
        <p></p>"That's right." Yuuta nodded.
        <p></p>"What is?" Kazuya wondered aloud. "What are you talking about?"
        <p></p>"I don't think it would make any sense to you, Kazuya; don't worry about it," Makoto 1
        <p></p>insisted.
        <p></p>Kazuya didn't seem upset at his friend for brushing him off. Instead, he smiled. "In that
        <p></p>case, I guess I don't need to know." His reaction showed the depths of their trust and
        <p></p>the strength of their friendship.
        <p></p>For some reason, Yuuta and Makoto nodded knowingly. Amane wondered what the
        <p></p>two of them were thinking and wore a puzzled expression as he continued picking at
        <p></p>his french fries.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, what events did you choose for Sports Day?"
        <p></p>As she was putting leftovers from dinner, packed in Tupperware, into the fridge and
        <p></p>was about to take ice cream out of the freezer, Amane asked Mahiru this question.
        <p></p>Some time had passed since the incident with the kiss, and while things between
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru had more or less settled down, the subtle awkwardness between
        <p></p>them had yet to completely dissipate.
        <p></p>No matter what they did, the two were both still extremely conscious of what had
        <p></p>happened. There was a distance between them that hadn't been there before. They 1
        <p></p>were back to sitting next to each other, but with enough space that they wouldn't
        <p></p>accidentally touch.
        <p></p>The atmosphere over dinner that night was also a little tense, though still amicable.
        <p></p>Even though things between them weren't exactly strained, it was clear that they were
        <p></p>both overly conscious of each other.
        <p></p>After passing the spoon for ice cream to Amane, she looked up in an attempt to
        <p></p>remember.
        <p></p>"Let me see… I chose the relay and the scavenger hunt."
        <p></p>"Oh, same here. But instead of the relay, I asked for the ball toss."
        <p></p>Amane didn't know whether he would get his top choices, but the ball toss was
        <p></p>honestly not very popular, so he figured it was likely he would.
        <p></p>It was a little iffy whether he would get the scavenger hunt, but even if he ended up
        <p></p>with his third choice, the obstacle course, that was okay with him.
        <p></p>That event tested a competitor's sense of balance and flexibility more than pure leg
        <p></p>strength, so even though Amane was not particularly fast, he probably wouldn't drag
        <p></p>his team down.
        <p></p>"You really don't like sports, do you?"
        <p></p>"Leave it to the pros. I'm just not that athletic, is all."
        <p></p>"…If I'm not mistaken, your grades in gym are about average, right?"
        <p></p>"Unfortunately, yeah."
        <p></p>Amane imagined he'd probably have better scores in gym class if he were more
        <p></p>athletically inclined, but sadly, sports were not his forte. He wasn't so awful that he'd
        <p></p>call it a weakness—he was comfortable being simply average.
        <p></p>The notion that he might excel in sports as well as academics seemed like a dream for
        <p></p>Amane, unlike Yuuta and Mahiru, both of whom had natural talent and worked hard.
        <p></p>"…If you were to be honest, you hate Sports Day, don't you, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Well, it's not that I necessarily hate exercise, but I do hate it when it's mandatory. I
        <p></p>like exercising on my own time, by myself."
        <p></p>As they made their way back to the living room sofa, Amane recalled a bitter memory
        <p></p>of a winter marathon he had run once. It wasn't that he lacked the endurance—he
        <p></p>could run the distances they did in gym class. He simply didn't find timed races to be
        <p></p>all that interesting.
        <p></p>It felt nicer just to run, at his own pace, toward his own goals, so it made sense that he
        <p></p>wasn't a fan of structured races.
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled sadly as she watched Amane take the lid off the ice cream with a bitter
        <p></p>look on his face.
        <p></p>"It's not like I don't understand," she said sympathetically. "I also don't really enjoy
        <p></p>doing something if I've been forced to do it."
        <p></p>"Right? So that's why I'm just going to do enough to contribute."
        <p></p>Amane didn't want to slack off enough to invite any negative attention, and he knew
        <p></p>he'd feel guilty if he didn't do his part. He wasn't going to go all out, but he would at
        <p></p>least do enough to demonstrate that he was capable. Though if he ended up getting
        <p></p>the events he'd requested, he figured he wouldn't have to try particularly hard anyway.
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, too bad I won't get to see you going all out."
        <p></p>"Leave it to me, I'll show you what I can do during the ball toss… probably."
        <p></p>"Probably?"
        <p></p>"Well, it's a boring event, so I won't stand out much."
        <p></p>Now that they were in high school, Amane didn't even understand why a childish event
        <p></p>like the ball toss was kept as part of the program. Surely there were some schools
        <p></p>where it had been phased out, but their school kept it nonetheless.
        <p></p>It was probably there to give the nonathletes a chance, but even so, Amane had gotten
        <p></p>the impression that nobody got too worked up over the ball toss.
        <p></p>"You have a fairly good aim when you're throwing things, Amane. Your shooting was
        <p></p>on-target when you played basketball in the gym the other day, and I've never seen
        <p></p>you miss when you throw a tissue or something into the trash. That's just because 1
        <p></p>you're too lazy to get up, though." Mahiru added a quiet jab at the end.
        <p></p>All Amane could do was force a smile.
        <p></p>"Please forgive me for being so lazy, since I never miss the trash can."
        <p></p>"Well, I suppose it's fine since you're in your own home. But I'm serious, you know,
        <p></p>your aim is quite good."
        <p></p>"I guess I'm all right at throwing things. Especially stuff like darts. My mom took me 1
        <p></p>along with her all the time."
        <p></p>Amane's mother had dragged her son around with her to all sorts of places, and he'd
        <p></p>picked up a number of useless skills—everything from Airsoft tournaments, to white
        <p></p>water rafting, to darts matches, bowling contests, and game centers.
        <p></p>Apparently, they were finally going to come in handy, so he supposed he shouldn't call
        <p></p>them completely useless.
        <p></p>"Don't you feel like you got a special education of sorts, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Maybe, but only in the field of games."
        <p></p>"That's amazing in a way, and so is Shihoko."
        <p></p>Mahiru sounded more impressed than amazed, but Amane, as the person who'd been
        <p></p>dragged around, wasn't sure he agreed with her sentiment.
        <p></p>But it was true that he owed a lot to his mother.
        <p></p>She had packed his days with all sorts of novel experiences, and during his middle
        <p></p>school years, when he'd gone through a difficult period, that had never changed. She'd
        <p></p>always made time for him. That had really helped him through his depression.
        <p></p>Nevertheless, it had been exhausting, being pulled from one place to the next, and he
        <p></p>hadn't always appreciated it.
        <p></p>"…Well, the event is what it is, and I doubt it will be especially exciting to watch. I'll put
        <p></p>in as much effort as I need to. It's gonna be pretty boring, though," he concluded, then
        <p></p>stuck his spoon into his partially melted ice cream and scooped up a bite.
        <p></p>The rich cacao ice cream was lightly sweetened, a limited-edition flavor made for
        <p></p>convenience stores by a famous chocolate company. It was one of the more expensive
        <p></p>ice creams on the market, so Amane wanted to savor every last morsel.
        <p></p>"Do you really hate Sports Day that much?"
        <p></p>"No, I just kind of hate spending half a day outside in my gym clothes now that it's
        <p></p>gotten hot. Though I guess we'll have tents."
        <p></p>"Well, when you put it that way, I can see your point. But you'd better do your best,
        <p></p>okay?"
        <p></p>"I'll do what I have to."
        <p></p>"Geez."
        <p></p>Mahiru pouted but then her gaze was drawn to the spoon or, to be more accurate, to
        <p></p>the ice cream. Amane couldn't help but laugh.
        <p></p>Thinking that he should have bought a second one just for Mahiru, since she liked
        <p></p>sweets so much, he held the spoon up in front of her for her to try a bite. Her eyes 1
        <p></p>sparkled enthusiastically.
        <p></p>She's really much easier to read than she used to be, huh?
        <p></p>Chuckling quietly, Amane brought the spoon closer to Mahiru's lips, and she took the
        <p></p>spoon into her mouth without hesitation, like a kitten accepting food from the hand of
        <p></p>its owner. 4
        <p></p>Her eyes closed in a satisfied smile.
        <p></p>The ice cream was delicious. He could tell by her expression.
        <p></p>Amane thought so, too, but Mahiru's tongue was more sensitive than most people's.
        <p></p>She was an excellent judge when it came to a food's quality and flavor. If she said that
        <p></p>something looked tasty, she was probably right.
        <p></p>"…This is the good stuff, isn't it?"
        <p></p>"You can tell?"
        <p></p>"I mean, it's obvious from the packaging. But it's even tastier than I expected."
        <p></p>"Is it? Here."
        <p></p>When he offered her another bite, she accepted it gladly.
        <p></p>Faced with a smile warm enough to melt ice cream right out of the freezer, Amane felt
        <p></p>his face slowly heating up.
        <p></p>…Crap, I just fed her like it was the most natural thing in the world.
        <p></p>He'd been trying his best to keep a bit of distance between them, yet he'd gone and
        <p></p>done that without thinking about it.
        <p></p>He thought they were both to blame, though, since Mahiru had shown him such an
        <p></p>unguarded expression, despite how things had been between them lately. But he
        <p></p>wouldn't have expected her to be happy about being spoon-fed by some guy.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru, you can have the rest." 1
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"I'm brewing some coffee, so I'm good. It's all yours."
        <p></p>Amane pushed the ice cream cup and spoon at Mahiru, who looked confused, and then
        <p></p>escaped to the kitchen, where he desperately shoved a filter and some coffee beans
        <p></p>into the coffee maker.
        <section id="53"></section>
        <p></p>Chapter 53: Saying Goodbye to My Cowardly Self 4
        <p></p>Early June—Amane's school held their Sports Day during the time of year when the
        <p></p>weather starts becoming more humid.
        <p></p>Unlike Field Day in elementary and middle school, high school Sports Day wasn't much
        <p></p>of a harmonious and happy event—if anything, it was more like an extension of their
        <p></p>usual gym class. No parents or guardians came to cheer them on.
        <p></p>Even so, it was one of the few yearly events run by the school, and
        <p></p>a certain part of the student body was always filled with excitement.
        <p></p> Especially the underclassmen in the athletic clubs, 
        <p></p>as they always eagerly embraced the opportunity to show off their
        <p></p>abilities to their upperclassmen.
        <p></p>On the other hand, most of the students who belonged to cultural clubs
        <p></p> showed no interest at all.
        <p></p>Amane, a member of the so-called "go-home club," fit best in the second group.
        <p></p>"What a pain."
        <p></p>Amane smiled secretly to himself when he heard another student in the same tent
        <p></p>with him grumble quietly.
        <p></p>Although similarly uninterested in the happenings, Amane wasn't so put off that he
        <p></p>was going to let it show. Instead, he'd chosen to maintain a composed expression.
        <p></p>Fortunately, he had been assigned to the events he'd requested and wasn't going to
        <p></p>end up running around in circles or anything. The only running around he was going
        <p></p>to be doing would be during the cavalry battle that all the boys were going to take part
        <p></p>in.
        <p></p>Yuuta, who was on the same red team as Amane and who was sitting in the tent with
        <p></p>him, gave Amane a look of surprise. "You don't seem that unhappy, Fujimiya. I thought
        <p></p>for sure you hated this stuff."
        <p></p>"Well, I got the events I wanted, and I don't have anything else to do now, so it's not so
        <p></p>bad. Though I do think that studying would be more fun."
        <p></p>"I think that's a pretty unusual opinion, I'd imagine…"
        <p></p>Kazuya had overheard them from nearby. "Seems like Fujimiya's excellent grades are
        <p></p>balanced out by not being so great at sports," he said. "Guess that's how it goes
        <p></p>sometimes."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't deny that and smiled bitterly. It was the truth, but having someone
        <p></p>else point it out gave him mixed feelings. He appreciated the compliment regarding
        <p></p>his academic abilities, but he couldn't help but long to excel in both school and sports.
        <p></p>"I've been good about following the training regimen that Kadowaki gave me, but I've
        <p></p>been thinking maybe I should put together a slightly more demanding program,"
        <p></p>Amane said.
        <p></p>"Hmm, well, the workout that we do is meant for athletes, so I think you should stick
        <p></p>with your current program, if you're just training for your health," Yuuta replied. "If
        <p></p>we lived a little closer together, I would go jogging and stuff with you, though."
        <p></p>"There's no way that I could match your speed and strength, Kadowaki."
        <p></p>"He's right," Makoto said with a weary look on his face. "Don't you remember how I
        <p></p>almost died when I went with you, Yuuta? You don't go jogging, you go running." He
        <p></p>had accompanied Yuuta on runs before.
        <p></p>Makoto wasn't one of the sports club types; he was actually a member of the
        <p></p>astronomy club. He was slim, small enough to be described as dainty, and his skin was
        <p></p>pale. He didn't look like he was capable of much exertion.
        <p></p>That said, Amane knew that dainty and small Mahiru was capable of intense exercise,
        <p></p>so the rule didn't always hold.
        <p></p>"Nah, I think Fujimiya can do it," Yuuta said. "Sounds like you didn't get that tired when
        <p></p>you used to run marathons and stuff."
        <p></p>"I've been training recently, working hard so that I don't get weak when I get older, but
        <p></p>I'm no match for a real athlete!"
        <p></p>"You are the only one who's already thinking about getting old…"
        <p></p>"You're a strange guy, Fujimiya. No, maybe I should say you're an interesting guy."
        <p></p>"Was that supposed to be a compliment?"
        <p></p>Kazuya has an honest, sincere personality, and his way of speaking is straightforward.
        <p></p>He's direct and doesn't hold back.
        <p></p>Amane had come to understand this since they started hanging out.
        <p></p>"I'm pretty sure that was supposed to be a compliment," Yuuta answered for him.
        <p></p>"In that case, thanks."
        <p></p>"Don't mention it."
        <p></p>"What are you all even talking about…?"
        <p></p>Makoto wasn't trying to hide his exasperation, but there wasn't any ridicule in his
        <p></p>words either, just simple frustration, as well as a slight tinge of genuine amusement.
        <p></p>"Now, now. Kazuya has always been a bit of an airhead," Yuuta said.
        <p></p>"I don't think I'm an airhead…"
        <p></p>"That's 'cause the person in question is the only one who can't tell. It's fine, Kazuya,
        <p></p>don't worry about it. You're perfect just the way you are."
        <p></p>"Hmph. Really?"
        <p></p>Kazuya seemed happy to accept that answer and didn't argue any further.
        <p></p>"You're okay with that…?" Amane mumbled, and looked toward the sports grounds.
        <p></p>Out on the field, students had been running the short distance races.
        <p></p>Judging from the length of the track, they were doing the hundred-meter dash. The
        <p></p>first heat seemed to have finished already, and the second one was starting to line up.
        <p></p>The next heat was a girls' group, and there were a few fast girls on the red team,
        <p></p>including a familiar face with reddish-brown hair.
        <p></p>"I thought Chitose quit the track and field club. Is she really that fast?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Yeah, Shirakawa is really fast," Yuuta answered. "In middle school, she was a track
        <p></p>club ace, you know."
        <p></p>"Huh, really?"
        <p></p>"Mm. Though she didn't join the club in high school. She said it was a pain in the butt
        <p></p>always fighting with the upperclassmen."
        <p></p>"I guess this is where I make a joke about what caused the fights?"
        <p></p>"Well, hmm, there's kind of a story behind it… but I guess you could say she got
        <p></p>discouraged or just tired of it."
        <p></p>"…Tired?"
        <p></p>"There were issues when she started dating Itsuki. How should I explain it…? Well,
        <p></p>there was an upperclassman on the track team who also liked Itsuki, see, and on top
        <p></p>of that, Shirakawa's times were faster than theirs… It created some tension, and one
        <p></p>thing led to another, get it?"
        <p></p>"Ah, I see now."
        <p></p>The two of them were well known in their grade as a couple, but Amane had heard
        <p></p>from Itsuki that during middle school, before they'd started dating, he had pursued
        <p></p>Chitose fervently.
        <p></p>Apparently, Chitose had had a much cooler personality back then, and it had taken
        <p></p>Itsuki quite some time to convince her to go out with him.
        <p></p>It wasn't difficult to imagine the upperclassman fighting with Chitose over Itsuki once
        <p></p>she realized what was going on.
        <p></p>"She said that all the obligations of a club were annoying and decided not to join, I
        <p></p>guess. But you know, she still likes running because I often spot her running on the
        <p></p>weekends."
        <p></p>Yuuta added that they lived in the same neighborhood, then smiled and looked over
        <p></p>at Chitose, who had taken her stance for a crouching start.
        <p></p>From Amane's perspective as a near beginner, Chitose's stance seemed masterful,
        <p></p>even beautiful.
        <p></p>Her expression, seen from a distance, was not her usual carefree joking smile but a
        <p></p>sharp and serious look.
        <p></p>The sound of the start gun echoed across the grounds.
        <p></p>The moment it did, Chitose was off, sprinting faster than anyone else.
        <p></p>She ran like the wind, with a form that anyone would have agreed was lovely to watch,
        <p></p>leaving even the current members of the track and field club behind.
        <p></p>Her hair streamed behind her in soft waves as her body moved intently forward. Her
        <p></p>feet pounded the ground with surprising force as she headed for the goal, faster than
        <p></p>any of the other runners.
        <p></p>Amane watched transfixed as Chitose cut through the goal tape before he even knew
        <p></p>it.
        <p></p>Chitose, who had run the course the fastest, held up the first-place flag and looked
        <p></p>toward the red team… toward where Amane was, with a big grin.
        <p></p>Waving the flag in the air with satisfaction, she made even him feel happy to be part
        <p></p>of the team.
        <p></p>Once the hundred-meter dash was over and Chitose came back to the tent, she had her
        <p></p>chest puffed up with pride.
        <p></p>"I'm baaack! Did you see me?"
        <p></p>"We did, we did. You were fast!"
        <p></p>"Yay, thanks!"
        <p></p>"You sure were. It feels great to watch you run, Shirakawa."
        <p></p>Chitose looked very pleased to receive compliments from two current members of the
        <p></p>track and field club.
        <p></p>Even Amane offered some words of praise. "Good job, you were flying."
        <p></p>She had been so much faster than he had expected that he could scarcely believe it.
        <p></p>But Chitose didn't seem all that excited about it. She smiled in a carefree manner. "Ahh,
        <p></p>that was fun."
        <p></p>She looked more like herself, without any air of tension about her. It was completely
        <p></p>different than how she'd looked while she was running. Amane smiled in relief.
        <p></p>"But man, you're as fast as ever, Shirakawa."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, that's because training is part of my daily routine. Though I'm not as fast as
        <p></p>I was during my club days."
        <p></p>It was a surprise to hear that she had been even faster during middle school. Somehow
        <p></p>Amane had surrounded himself with people who had outstanding physical and mental
        <p></p>capabilities; it made the average Amane feel very jealous.
        <p></p>Kazuya had also attended the same middle school as Yuuta and the others, but since
        <p></p>he wasn't a member of the track and field club, he had also been surprised to see her
        <p></p>run so quickly.
        <p></p>"I've always wondered this, but how do you move so fast? I guess you don't have much
        <p></p>surface area, so that must really reduce the air resistance?"
        <p></p>"Hey, Kazu, what exactly do you mean by 'not much surface area'?"
        <p></p>"Hmm? I'm talking about your height."
        <p></p>Kazuya looked at Chitose with innocent eyes, as if to ask what else he might possibly
        <p></p>be referring to, and she frowned back at him.
        <p></p>Her expression was probably not one of anger but of embarrassment. Amane had no
        <p></p>doubt she had thought he was talking about her chest.
        <p></p>While Chitose was not as petite as Mahiru, she wasn't exactly tall, either. She was a bit
        <p></p>taller than the average girl, but not quite as tall as the other runners. On top of that,
        <p></p>she was undeniably slim, so Kazuya must have been surprised by how fast she was.
        <p></p>Amane didn't detect any ulterior motive from the way Kazuya was behaving, so
        <p></p>Chitose had just jumped to the wrong conclusion.
        <p></p>"You played yourself on that one, Shirakawa."
        <p></p>"Shut up, Mako."
        <p></p>Chitose's cheeks suddenly flushed red, and she slapped Makoto playfully on the back
        <p></p>as she sat down next to him. Amane smirked just a little, so that she wouldn't spot him.
        <p></p>Amane only needed to compete in the ball toss and scavenger hunt, which were both
        <p></p>exhibition events, as well as the cavalry battle that all the boys participated in, so he
        <p></p>had plenty of time to kill.
        <p></p>Other students who were overflowing with enthusiasm had requested more than two
        <p></p>events, but Amane didn't share their zeal. He had only picked two, plus the all-hands
        <p></p>match.
        <p></p>The ball toss was already over.
        <p></p>It wasn't an exciting game, just a matter of throwing balls into a basket that was placed
        <p></p>up high.
        <p></p>There was usually a scramble to get to the balls to toss into the basket, but there were
        <p></p>also usually plenty of balls to go around, so nobody took the event that seriously
        <p></p>anyway. It had been a peaceful contest from beginning to end.
        <p></p>It was just a matter of picking up several balls, turning around and piling them up,
        <p></p>then tossing them all in, and repeating. A simple task that didn't attract any attention.
        <p></p>But either Amane's aim was more precise, or he'd been more successful at collecting
        <p></p>the balls, because he ended up with the most in his basket at the end.
        <p></p>"You really went for the bland events, didn't you, Amane?" Chitose remarked.
        <p></p>"Oh, hush. It's about time for your shift, isn't it? Get going."
        <p></p>"Oh, right. Executive committee members sure are busy…" she grumbled as she looked
        <p></p>over her schedule, before heading for the management tent.
        <p></p>Amane wondered why she had volunteered in the first place, but it was too late to say
        <p></p>anything.
        <p></p>As Chitose jogged away, Amane checked the agenda for the day, which was posted on
        <p></p>one of the tent poles nearby.
        <p></p>The morning program would be over after a few more events. The scavenger hunt, the
        <p></p>last event that Amane was participating in as an individual, was one of them.
        <p></p>Once those were finished, everyone would break for lunch before moving on to the
        <p></p>afternoon program.
        <p></p>As far as he knew, after his event was over, he would have nothing to do until the
        <p></p>cavalry battle in the afternoon.
        <p></p>"…So that means Chitose's in charge during the scavenger hunt, I guess?"
        <p></p>Since she had gone to take her shift just then, that probably meant she would be
        <p></p>directing the remaining events. It was a safe bet that she would be judging that one as
        <p></p>well… Amane had a feeling Chitose had set it up that way on purpose.
        <p></p>He didn't know who had thought up the scavenger hunt items, but he had a hunch that
        <p></p>they were most likely weird and started to feel a little nervous.
        <p></p>Reluctantly, he headed for the assembly spot for the event. When he arrived, Mahiru
        <p></p>was already standing there quietly. She had also gotten her choice of events.
        <p></p>He didn't have any particular reason to speak to her, so Amane didn't approach her,
        <p></p>but when he made eye contact with her, she smiled faintly and nodded in greeting.
        <p></p>In public, they treated each other as strangers, but Mahiru's real smile revealed itself
        <p></p>just a little bit through her placid expression, and Amane's heart jumped in his chest.
        <p></p>He returned the greeting with a blank look on his face, but he couldn't deny feeling
        <p></p>somewhat uncomfortable.
        <p></p>As Chitose gathered the participants for the scavenger hunt and finished her duties as
        <p></p>a Sports Day administrator, she kept peeking at Amane and Mahiru, looking very
        <p></p>pleased.
        <p></p>When it was time for the event to begin, the referee—in this case, that designation
        <p></p>belonged to Chitose—entered the grounds.
        <p></p>The field was already scattered with several folded pieces of paper, and when the start
        <p></p>signal was given, all the contestants had to do was to pick up one of those slips and go
        <p></p>get the things that were written on them.
        <p></p>Unlike the other running events, the scavenger hunt was almost relaxing. The goal was
        <p></p>to have fun borrowing the necessary items, so it wasn't that serious of a race.
        <p></p>But depending on the objects, sometimes they were embarrassing to collect, and that
        <p></p>was something to watch out for.
        <p></p>"All participants, please take your places at the starting line!"
        <p></p>Chitose smartly issued instructions through a microphone. She made a great master
        <p></p>of ceremonies when she wasn't messing around. She had a cheerful personality and
        <p></p>could read the mood well. Plus, her voice was easy to hear, clear, and not too highpitched, which was
        ideal for making announcements.
        <p></p>Surely she wasn't going to prank them now, Amane thought, not with all the students
        <p></p>and staff watching.
        <p></p>"On your marks!" she signaled.
        <p></p>The actual starting pistol was in the hands of another official, a boy—Chitose was just
        <p></p>doing the countdown.
        <p></p>"Get set!" Chitose said, then after a pause, the sound of the gun echoed across the field.
        <p></p>No matter how many times he had heard it before, that sound nearly gave Amane a
        <p></p>heart attack. Trying not to let it show, he jogged slowly over to the pile of papers.
        <p></p>The faster contestants had already opened up their papers and read what was written
        <p></p>on them. Amane followed suit, picking up one of them and checking inside.
        <p></p>Written in meticulous handwriting were the words Someone you find beautiful.
        <p></p>Amane had predicted something like this, that they might be sent to retrieve people
        <p></p>rather than objects.
        <p></p>He wanted to make a quip about who might have come up with the idea. Fortunately,
        <p></p>even Amane would be able to clear this challenge, if only just barely.
        <p></p>He hadn't drawn a paper that said The person you like, which would have given him
        <p></p>serious trouble. Amane figured he could fulfill the challenge by finding anyone who
        <p></p>was objectively attractive.
        <p></p>In other words, someone who anyone would recognize as a beauty… He could call out
        <p></p>to Mahiru. Once Mahiru was done collecting her item, they just had to go to the goal
        <p></p>together and he could score his points as well.
        <p></p>He was sure to attract a lot of attention being with Mahiru, but he would only be
        <p></p>following his instructions. He knew that once everyone heard the item he was
        <p></p>supposed to retrieve, they would agree he made the appropriate choice.
        <p></p>With that thought in mind, Amane looked around for Mahiru, who had probably
        <p></p>already set off to find her item, when… from beside him, someone grabbed his T-shirt.
        <p></p>He felt a tug on his sleeve and turned around to see who it was.
        <p></p>His eyes fell on the person he had just been looking for, staring at him shyly.
        <p></p>"Fujimiya, you are my scavenger hunt item, so when you're finished finding yours, I'd
        <p></p>like to ask you to come with me."
        <p></p>"Huh, me?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>He had never imagined they would be each other's object.
        <p></p>In a way, it was convenient, but he had a feeling they were going to draw a lot of
        <p></p>attention—but he was already talking with Mahiru in the very center of the athletic
        <p></p>field, and they had people already watching them.
