        him, but without revealing it in the least, he patted her head once more. He heard a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        truly quiet little whisper: "…Thank you so much."<p></p>
        <p></p>

        21 Valentine’s Day<p></p>
        By the beginning of February, rumors concerning Mahiru's "mystery man, possible<p></p>
        <p></p>
        boyfriend" finally died down, despite the fact that Amane had carelessly added fuel to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the fire by picking her up from the station.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even so, the idea of a boy who was not her boyfriend but was still very close to Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seemed to have taken root instead, and the new rumor was that Mahiru had feelings<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for that boy… but Mahiru cheerfully denied it all in her friendly but ultimately<p></p>
        <p></p>
        unyielding way, so eventually the stream of gossip dried up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had heard from Chitose, who had been observing the situation in the hallways,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that "her denial left no room for argument," so it seemed like Mahiru was pretty upset.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He wasn't surprised, but he was a little sad to hear how vehemently she was denying<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it. Still, he knew there wasn't much to be done about it. The current situation was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        probably driving Mahiru crazy, having to listen to all these wild rumors about a guy<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she didn't even like that way.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could do nothing but wear a wry smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So speaking of February…," Chitose prodded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh yeah, final exams are coming up," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You know, for a teenage boy, you sure lack imagination."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose didn't hide her disapproval at his reply.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She had paid him a visit at his apartment after school—or rather, she had barged in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        without an invitation—on the pretense that she had something important to discuss,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        though Amane was pretty sure she'd actually come to hang out with Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Incidentally, Mahiru was in the kitchen putting on a pot of tea, so Amane and Chitose<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were alone in the living room.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't know about other high school guys and their imaginations, but I'd say that's a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        reasonable train of thought for any student…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "A high school guy in the prime of his life should be thinking about Valentine's Day,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        don't you think?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not in the prime of anything so no…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "There you go again!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose was giving him a mischievous look even though she should know better than<p></p>
        <p></p>
        most that there was no truth behind the rumors.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane glared at her, but her smile refused to crack. "So…," he said with a sigh, "what<p></p>
        <p></p>
        did you want to talk about?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose had made a point to come to Amane's apartment alone. She obviously had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something she wanted to discuss with Amane and Mahiru, but not with her boyfriend,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm. I wanted to ask you what I should do about chocolates for Itsuki. When we were<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in middle school, I made him chocolates out of a kit, the kind where you melt the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chocolate and pour it into a mold, but since we're high schoolers now, I'd like to make<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something more sophisticated."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "In that case, Shiina's the one you oughtta ask."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After all, Amane knew nothing about cooking. At most, he might be able to offer some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        insight into his best friend's tastes, but Chitose had actually been dating Itsuki for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        longer than Amane had known him, so she probably knew what Itsuki liked better<p></p>
        <p></p>
        than he did.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm gonna ask her, too, but I thought since you're sorta a guy… you know? Maybe I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        could get a male opinion."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not sorta anything. I'm all man."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If you were a real man, you'd have made a move on a certain pretty girl by now,"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose said slyly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Now, listen," Amane said with a grimace, "I've explained this before—we don't have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that sort of relationship. And besides, a real man is supposed to wait until he's in a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        relationship to make a move."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, how wonderfully chivalrous of you," Chitose teased. "Your mama must have raised<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you right."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose might think he was uptight, but Amane didn't see anything wrong with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wanting to take it slow. Sure, plenty of guys could mess around with girls they didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        even like, but could wasn't the same as should. More importantly, Amane couldn't see<p></p>
        <p></p>
        himself doing that, especially if the other party just wasn't interested.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Now, it would have been a lie to say that he didn't have certain feelings for Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Spending time with a girl so beautiful—inside and out—would stir up those sorts of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        emotions in most any man.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        But even then, the foolish idea to try something with had her never surfaced.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Whenever he thought about it, all kinds of other things got in the way—worrying<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about hurting her feelings, worrying that she might come to hate him, worrying that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he did not appreciate her enough.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Also, Mahiru had made it quite clear that trying anything would result in serious social<p></p>
        <p></p>
        repercussions, as well as grievous physical harm to a certain vital organ, and he did<p></p>
        <p></p>
        not think that she was bluffing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, that's one of your good points, Amane, and I'm sure it's why Mahirun feels like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she can trust you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose had started referring to Mahiru by a nickname that had a cute ring to it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was listening in from the kitchen, but she didn't stop Chitose from calling her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that, so whether she was reluctant or comfortable with the name herself, she must<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have known that she had a nickname now.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As far as Mahiru was concerned, it was better than being called an angel to her face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Though sometimes I wonder whether you're really a man at all…," Chitose continued.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I can assure you, I am. I mean, have you ever seen a girl this flat?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, you're much too passive. A man is supposed to be a little ferocious sometimes."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You think a guy like me could pull off ferocious?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You'd be fine if you dressed the part like those other times. Honestly, I'd like to see it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for myself."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki and Chitose had long since deduced that Amane was Mahiru's mystery man, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he had finally acknowledged it just the other day, so there was no point in hiding it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        now. But he wasn't about to get all dressed up just for their amusement.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Give it up already."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come on; it's no big deeeal!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I can't spare the hair wax—or the patience, for that matter."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Cheapskate!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Mahiru returned from the kitchen carrying a tray with three cups of milk tea,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose had puffed out her cheeks and was pouting at him. Mahiru smiled as she set<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the tray on the coffee table.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane sprung up from the sofa and moved to a cushion on the floor, gesturing for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru to sit down. She gingerly took the now-vacant seat, looking apologetic.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But if you look good enough to gossip about," Chitose continued, "imagine how<p></p>
        <p></p>
        popular you'd be if you dressed that way all the time."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No way. It's a huge hassle, and I don't even wanna be popular in the first place."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Whaaat? Not even with Valentine's Day coming up? Don't you want to get lots of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chocolate, Amane? Like, he's just one example, but Yuu's super popular, and it seems<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like he gets tons of chocolates. Aren't you the slightest bit jealous?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No way. I'd get diabetes."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        By Yuu, Chitose must have been referring to Yuuta. Assigning weird nicknames to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        people seemed to be one of Chitose's many habits. Fortunately, she hadn't gotten<p></p>
        <p></p>
        around to thinking of one for Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Maybe Yuuta—dubbed the prince—did receive tons of chocolate, but there was no<p></p>
        <p></p>
        way he could eat it all without getting fat.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Anyway, it's depressing just to think about the returns," Amane added. "I mean,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        between the chocolates people just give out to be polite and the ones people give out<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to confess their feelings, Kadowaki's probably on the receiving end of several dozen<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gifts, and then he has to pay all those back threefold. That's gotta be hell on a high<p></p>
        <p></p>
        school student's wallet."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How admirable to assume that he's going to pay everything back threefold. Well, I'm<p></p>
        <p></p>
        going to give you some chocolate, and you don't need to worry about return gifts or<p></p>
        <p></p>
        anything like that. What kind do you like?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not really into sweet things, so… something not too sweet."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Got it; I'll come up with something."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't put anything funny in there."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's fine; it'll all be edible."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wasn't sure what Chitose was planning, but he was definitely expecting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something more than an ordinary box of chocolates.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahirun, who are you giving chocolate to?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "The girls I'm friends with in my class."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Not to any boys?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…If I give anyone chocolate, even courtesy chocolate, they take it the wrong way, so…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah-ha."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could easily imagine the uproar among the boys—and the pointless fighting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that was sure to follow. Most of the boys in his class would treat chocolate from the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        school angel like mana from heaven, so if word got around that Mahiru was giving out<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chocolate, it would definitely mean trouble. Amane wasn't sure whether Mahiru's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        popularity or the boys' foolishness was more to blame.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Obviously, it's safer for Mahiru to avoid giving out any chocolate at all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane nodded and smiled to himself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, and I'll also save some chocolate for you, Chitose."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yaaay! I love you, Mahirun. I'll give you some, too. The real stuff, not like what I'm<p></p>
        <p></p>
        giving Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I heard that!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose was grinning widely as she squeezed Mahiru tight.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was relieved to see the way she was touching Mahiru didn't constitute sexual<p></p>
        <p></p>
        harassment, but he kept a sharp eye on Chitose to make it clear he wouldn't let her get<p></p>
        <p></p>
        away with anything.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm just joookiiing. I'm gonna give you the edible stuff, too, okay, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I have a feeling that edible and tasty are two very different things here…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane pressed a hand to his forehead. He could feel a headache coming on. Chitose<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was certainly excited about her latest plot. She didn't even try to hide her delight as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she laughed at Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm sure you'll enjoy your present!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        On Valentine's Day, as Amane had predicted, the mood at school was tense. Everyone<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was restless; no one could settle down. Many people believed that a guys' social status<p></p>
        <p></p>
        depended on whether he received chocolates on Valentine's Day. At the moment, most<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of the boys were trying to act like they weren't desperately waiting for something.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Everyone's all worked up, huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It certainly seemed nerve-racking. Amane, on the other hand, didn't care a bit about<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his social standing, so he had the privilege of watching the day pass through the eyes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of a remote observer. His attention turned to Itsuki, who also had nothing to worry<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about today, though for a different reason.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Looks that way," Itsuki answered, staring nonchalantly across the classroom.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mr. Itsuki, as a man with a girlfriend—a man who, I might add, appears totally calm<p></p>
        <p></p>
        today—we'd like to ask for your opinion on this year's Valentine's Day proceedings."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, Amane, the boys certainly look desperate. Understandable, considering that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        whether they receive chocolates today can have major ramifications on their sense of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pride as men in the coming weeks. And let's not forget that approximately sixty percent<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of these fine young fellows are, at this very moment, sweating over whether they<p></p>
        <p></p>
        might receive chocolates from the lovely lady Shiina."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Apparently, she's not giving anything to the guys, not even courtesy chocolate. Since<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it would get out of hand."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, I guess it would… By the way, do you think you're getting anything from a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        certain someone?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No idea. At least, I haven't seen any indication that I might."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was giving chocolates to the girls but not the guys, so Amane didn't expect that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she was going to give him any. Of course, he would feel grateful if she did give him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some, but he was fine either way.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Honestly, as far as Amane was concerned, Valentine's Day was all just a big sales<p></p>
        <p></p>
        promotion cooked up by confectionery companies, so it wasn't something he really<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cared about.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki chuckled at his friend's obvious disinterest. "You sure are blunt, Amane." Then<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his attention turned to a particularly lively corner of the classroom. "Now, that… That's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        somethin', all right."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki was gesturing toward a handsome young man with a captivating smile<p></p>
        <p></p>
        surrounded by a group of girls all jostling to hand him different bags and boxes of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chocolates.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Class hadn't even started yet, and already the bag that the boy had apparently brought<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expressly as a receptacle was stuffed full of presents, undeniable proof of his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tremendous popularity.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't know whether to say 'It figures' or what."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You can just feel the hatred wafting off the other guys."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The boys shooting Yuuta envious looks or staring hopelessly into the distance likely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had not received anything from anyone yet. The difference between their social<p></p>
        <p></p>
        standings was obvious.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It must be a real pain to have to carry home so much chocolate, Amane told himself,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wondering what he would even do with that much candy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Popular guys have it rough, huh? What do you think he even does with it all?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, seriously. I'm amazed he doesn't get fat. It's been like this ever since middle<p></p>
        <p></p>
        school, but his figure hasn't changed at all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You can definitely tell he's a track-and-field guy. Well, at least that's a problem I won't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have to worry about."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Not so fast. Chitose really outdid herself this time. You'd better prepare yourself."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Whaddaya mean 'prepare myself'?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's a Russian roulette."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Knock it off. What'd she mix in?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Their exchange the previous day heavily implied that Chitose wasn't planning to make<p></p>
        <p></p>
        normal sweets, but Itsuki made it sound like she'd used some incredibly questionable<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ingredients.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Let's see, one piece is a three-in-one habanero, wasabi, and hot pepper chocolate.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Another has pickled plum concentrate jelly in it. And the rest are normal chocolate."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What the hell has she created?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Apparently, she wanted to surprise you, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In a certain sense, he was surprised, but it was mostly in the about to faint sense.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Now I'm afraid to eat them."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Surrender all hope. I've already walked this thorny path."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I bet you ate them all for a laugh."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Maybe. As long as Chi makes it, I'll eat anything."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You two sicken me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki might put whatever Chitose offered him into his mouth without a second<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thought, but Amane wasn't so trusting.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose wasn't actually all that bad at cooking; the problem was that she always got<p></p>
        <p></p>
        carried away with her next grand idea. She was perfectly capable of preparing entirely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ordinary dishes; she just chose to create culinary calamities sometimes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        While her main victim was Itsuki, Amane was surprised to suddenly find himself in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the crosshairs. That said, from the way Itsuki was acting, he didn't think it could be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        too terrible. There was probably nothing to worry about, despite the agonized faces<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that Itsuki was making.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Still, Amane couldn't help but shake a strange feeling of melancholy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Okay, Amane, here you go!" Chitose said, handing him his chocolates. She had caught<p></p>
        <p></p>
        up with Amane and Itsuki in their classroom after school.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Thank you," Amane replied somewhat reluctantly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He didn't want to seem ungrateful, though he had to admit he was a little concerned<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about the chocolates she had made. He was still going to eat them all, obviously, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he wasn't looking forward to finding the super-spicy and super-sour chocolates she'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apparently hidden in the batch.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm sure you've heard from Itsuki, but be ready for something exciting!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't really like spicy food…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's not that bad, you wuss! I taste tested everything myself. In fact, I thought the hot<p></p>
        <p></p>
        one was actually really good!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, but you like spicy stuff…," Amane moaned. "Geez…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane didn't like spicy or sour food. It was like Chitose had gone out of her way to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        include flavors that Amane couldn't handle. On the other hand, the rest of the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chocolates were sure to be really delicious, so…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, and there's also a super-sweet one and a super-bitter one mixed in."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thanks for the warning…," Amane groaned. It was just like Chitose to add in a few<p></p>
        <p></p>
        extra land mines at the last minute.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The super-sweet one probably featured condensed milk, while the super-bitter one<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was probably made of close to 99 percent cacao chocolate. That actually didn't sound<p></p>
        <p></p>
        too bad. Amane handled bitter foods better than most.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, this was the first time Itsuki was hearing this, and his face twitched as he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        murmured, "Chi… you're unbelievable…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose continued smiling. "It'll be fine. There's even a special palate cleanser in there."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And what might that be?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, we're going now, bye-byeee." Without answering Amane's question, Chitose<p></p>
        <p></p>
        grabbed Itsuki's hand and walked off. Apparently, they had a Valentine's date to get to.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Good luck, man!" Itsuki offered as he was pulled away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane let out an exhausted sigh and waved good-bye. After watching them disappear<p></p>
        <p></p>
        from sight, he pulled on his coat, thinking it was about time for him to head home, too,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and picked up his bag from the hook on the side of his desk.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane usually didn't mind being alone, but today he felt out of place among all the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        lovesick boys and girls. He shouldered his bag and glanced around the room.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The flurry of gift giving seemed to have finally subsided. Yuuta sat staring vacantly at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the enormous pile of presents on his desk. The other boys in the class could only<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dream of such a hoard, and the bag hanging from the side of his desk was stuffed full<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of even more treasures.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could guess what was weighing on Yuuta's mind and couldn't help but feel bad<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for him. He approached the other boy's desk.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Kadowaki?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm? Ah, Fujimiya. What's up?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They had been classmates for almost a year, so he remembered Amane's name, even<p></p>
        <p></p>
        though Amane didn't have much of a presence in class.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had never taken the initiative to talk to Yuuta before, outside of a few group<p></p>
        <p></p>
        assignments, and the other boy seemed curious about the sudden interaction.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane responded to his confusion with an awkward smile, then undid the zipper of a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        small pocket on the front of his bag.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nothing in particular, just, here—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        From the pocket, Amane pulled out several plastic supermarket bags, folded into<p></p>
        <p></p>
        compact triangles, and tossed them to Yuuta.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had put them there and told him, "Keep a few of these in your bag. That way<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you'll have them whenever you need them." He had imagined he might use them for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        garbage or maybe in case of motion sickness, but he'd never expected them to come<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in handy like this.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Looking perplexed by the strange bundles, Yuuta unfolded one of the triangles to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        reveal a relatively large disposable shopping bag. The plastic didn't look particularly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        durable, but Amane decided that Yuuta would just have to manage somehow.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Did I… uh… read the situation wrong?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "N-no…," Yuuta replied. "You're right on target, but—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Great. Well, good luck with all that." Reflecting on the many hazards of popularity,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane waved good-bye and left the classroom.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Later, Yuuta was spotted around the school carrying several shopping bags stuffed to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bursting.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Though it was Valentine's Day, that didn't mean that there was anything special in the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        air at home, and Amane went back to his apartment to relax just like always.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was too early to start making dinner, so he and Mahiru lounged beside each other<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on the couch. She didn't seem excited or on edge in any way, and Amane took this as a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sign that she was definitely not planning anything special today.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He didn't mind, since he wasn't expecting anything in the first place, but couldn't quite<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dispel the slight disappointment that he chalked up to his manly pride.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "There was a sweet smell hanging over the school today, huh?" Amane remarked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It is Valentine's Day," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had heard a lot of disappointed grumbling coming from the boys in his class.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had only given chocolates to her female friends—she hadn't even handed out<p></p>
        <p></p>
        courtesy chocolates to the boys.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wondered why any of them had assumed they might receive anything in the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        first place—it wasn't like they had any kind of relationship with her… but nevertheless,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        they had high hopes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, Valentine's Day really only matters to the popular guys anyway. It's got nothing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to do with lackluster guys like me…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How very perceptive of you," Mahiru remarked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not exactly proud to say this," Amane continued unprompted, "but I've never<p></p>
        <p></p>
        received a romantic gift from anyone. Though, I did just get some Russian roulette<p></p>
        <p></p>
        courtesy chocolates from Chitose."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Russian roulette courtesy chocolates?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Apparently, mixed in among the normal chocolates are some… exciting concoctions."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was impossible to tell the super-spicy, super-sour, super-sweet, and super-bitter<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chocolates from the rest, and any one of them seemed capable of obliterating his sense<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of taste. Amane was kind of afraid to start eating at all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Another amazing creation…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I'll eat them later, but please show some sympathy if you find me rolling around<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in agony."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're going to eat them all?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "The thing is… She sorta made them just for me, so I kinda feel obligated to eat them.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Besides, it's not like they're poisonous or anything."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The chocolates might be extra stimulating, but it wasn't like they would cause him any<p></p>
        <p></p>
        real harm, and Chitose had gone out of her way to make and deliver them, so he was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        one hundred percent planning to eat them all with gratitude in his heart. Still, the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        exciting ingredients made him rather nervous.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Is that how it is?" Mahiru muttered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, it's not like I got any other chocolates, and for a loner like me, Valentine's Day<p></p>
        <p></p>
        doesn't mean much besides an excuse to eat some candy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was perfectly content with a single courtesy gift. He was already worried about<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the day one month from now when he would have to repay Chitose's present and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wondered what he should get her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru simply stared at him silently.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After dinner, Amane decided to sample one of Chitose's chocolates and ended up<p></p>
        <p></p>
        facedown on his desk in agony.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose had arranged evenly spaced partitions containing twelve truffles inside the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        box. There were four varieties of "surprise" chocolate. That meant he had a one-in-three<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chance of picking something that would give his taste buds the shock of a lifetime.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Among those, the worst was sure to be the super-spicy one. Amane figured that he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        could handle the rest without too much trouble, but—<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You found one, didn't you?" Mahiru asked in a sympathetic tone. She had been in the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        kitchen preparing drinks and returned to find Amane in obvious distress.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I was planning to eat them all over a few days, and this is what I get…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane quickly quaffed his drink, but the inside of his mouth was beyond hot. This<p></p>
        <p></p>
        went beyond having a low tolerance for spicy food—he was in real pain here. It wasn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        more than he could handle, but it was still pretty intense.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As the characteristically sharp sting of wasabi shot through his nose, Amane found<p></p>
        <p></p>
        himself thinking how impressive it was that Chitose had managed to include so much<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of the volatile component. He cursed her name while trying to hold back the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        instinctive tears.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The wasabi attacked his nose and eyes, while the habanero powder and hot pepper<p></p>
        <p></p>
        burned his tongue. A single nibble of these intense flavors—or rather, intense<p></p>
        <p></p>
        torments—was enough to ruin him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "My condolences," Mahiru said. "But think of it this way—if you make it through hell<p></p>
        <p></p>
        first, the rest will be heaven."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Easy for her to say. Amane was still in agony. He heard a soft sigh and then the sound<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of something hard being set down beside him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Here, this should help."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When he raised his head, there was a mug beside him, filled with a dark-brown liquid,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        giving off steam and a sweet aroma.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Cocoa?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Something like that. It's called chocolat chaud. It's French hot chocolate. I made it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fairly sweet. It should help cleanse your palate."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm saved…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Right now, the only thing Amane wanted to do was to wash away this pain.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Amane tipped the contents of the mug into his mouth, a rich flavor enveloped his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        senses. The liquid had the luscious fragrance of full-bodied chocolate but was actually<p></p>
        <p></p>
        not that sweet. It tasted like dark chocolate and possessed a calming flavor that went<p></p>
        <p></p>
        down very easily.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's great."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm glad to hear it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane slowly sipped the hot chocolate, attempting to soothe the pain in his mouth.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The truffle hadn't actually contained very much of the spicy mixture. It had mostly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been ganache coated in a thick layer of chocolate and covered in powdered sugar. The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        weaponized sweet packed a big kick up front, but the impact faded as time went on.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        By the time Amane had drained his mug, he was left with only a slight tingle on his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tongue.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sigh… She really outdid herself…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Was it really that spicy?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, it had pepper and wasabi and habanero in it, so yeah. Damn… I'm glad you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        made that palate cleanser, but I think I would've died if I ate any more."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I suppose there's no harm done."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Good grief."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even as he cursed Chitose's name under his breath, he knew that she had tried in her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        own way to surprise him, so he couldn't really be upset with her. All the chocolates<p></p>
        <p></p>
        besides the special four probably tasted normal, so it wasn't like there was any malice<p></p>
        <p></p>
        behind it. And she had even tried all the exotic ingredients herself. Amane could do<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nothing but smile bitterly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Anyway, the hot chocolate was a nice surprise. Usually you stick to hot milk, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Yes, well…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Did you decide to make this because it's Valentine's Day?" Amane asked hopefully.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru basically always drank hot milk or milk tea, so the cocoa was unexpected.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Maybe."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, thank you. You're a lifesaver."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru responded with a small nod, and Amane breathed a quiet sigh of relief.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had gone out on a limb there, and if she had shot him down, he would have looked<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like a real idiot. But apparently, he'd been right on the money. Mahiru had wanted to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        do something special for Valentine's Day after all. Amane was sure there wasn't any<p></p>
        <p></p>
        deeper meaning to it than that, but he was still grateful.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It was delicious," he said again.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru seemed uncomfortable.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is something the matter?" he prodded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Um, well—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane knew that sitting beside her and pressing her for an answer would probably<p></p>
        <p></p>
        just make it harder for her to tell him, so he tried to be patient and listen instead.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru hugged one of the pillows over half her face as she stared up at him anxiously.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She looked like a small and strangely adorable animal, which made Amane want to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smile and reach out and pat her on the head. He continued waiting, but instead of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        continuing her thought, Mahiru simply trembled silently.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Then she stood up suddenly and grabbed her bags.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm… going home."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        By the time Amane let out a noise of surprise, Mahiru had already slipped out of the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        living room. He was frozen in place as he listened to the sound of her receding<p></p>
        <p></p>
        footsteps, then the front door opening and closing, and finally the sound of the lock<p></p>
        <p></p>
        turning. In a flash, Mahiru was gone.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He couldn't help letting out a confused noise at this quick work. "Eh…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Did I do something wrong…?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His heart was torn between surprise at her unexpected departure and worry that he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had inadvertently driven her away. He stood up, thinking about what he should do if<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was still in a bad mood when he saw her tomorrow, and went to check the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        front door. Suddenly, he caught sight of a light-pink paper bag hanging from the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        doorknob of his room. Mahiru must have left it there.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Inside the bag was a pastel-pink box tied with a chocolate-colored ribbon, and there<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was a card affixed to the front with a sticker. The handwriting was smooth and neat.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Thank you for always being there for me. Please accept this with my gratitude.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane realized why she had left the bag there. Just handing it to him would have been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        too awkward, especially after she had decided not to give chocolate to any other boys.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She could have just given it to me…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Smiling gently at how surprisingly timid Mahiru could be in these sorts of situations,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane sat back down on the sofa and examined the contents of the bag.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The adorable wrapping paper reminded him of Mahiru's sophisticated yet feminine<p></p>
        <p></p>
        style.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane figured it was all right for him to go ahead and open it, and with some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apprehension, he slowly unwrapped the box.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Inside were candied orange rings dipped in chocolate, each individually wrapped in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        plastic—in other words, orangettes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The contrast between the bright color and the deep luster of the chocolate was dazzling<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to the eye, and the box even included a few with white chocolate coating, and some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        used lemon peels instead of oranges. They looked delicious, and Amane appreciated<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the variety.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was a second card accompanying the Orangettes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        You don't seem to like sweet things too much, so I made you something that I thought<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would better suit your tastes. I hope you like it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He recalled a conversation from about ten days earlier.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What kind do you like?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not really into sweet things, so… something not too sweet."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, Mahiru had remembered his conversation with Chitose perfectly and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        picked something that would match his tastes. Amane suddenly felt very self-conscious.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He hadn't expected to receive anything at all, and here she had selected something<p></p>
        <p></p>
        especially for him. It was typical of the sensitive, considerate Mahiru. Amane could feel<p></p>
        <p></p>
        himself starting to blush just thinking about it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He reached down and picked up one of the orangettes, appreciating the beautiful<p></p>
        <p></p>
        colors as he unwrapped the candy and slowly took a bite. The sugary and astringent<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bite of the candied orange peel melded perfectly with the pleasantly bitter chocolate<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in his mouth, each flavor complimenting the other in a splendid harmony.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …So good…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane marveled at how Mahiru's handmade confections were much better than<p></p>
        <p></p>
        anything he'd ever gotten from the store as he took another bite.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's orangettes were a little sour, a little bitter—and intensely sweet.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, Fujimiya, thanks for yesterday."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The following morning, Yuuta casually approached Amane at school. He seemed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cheerful and friendly, but Amane couldn't help but feel nervous talking to him. Even<p></p>
        <p></p>
        though they had briefly spoken the day before, Amane never would have expected him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to go out of his way to come say thanks just for that.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A few people shot them curious glances, which only made Amane even more nervous.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He didn't like being the center of attention.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, don't worry about it. You looked like you were having a hard time."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, yeah…" Yuuta got a faraway look in his eyes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I bet being a popular guy is really tough, huh?" Amane tried to sympathize.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Yuuta was clearly aware of his popularity, but it wasn't the kind of thing he would ever<p></p>
        <p></p>
        flaunt. That was part of why everybody liked him—and why even the most jealous<p></p>
        <p></p>
        boys couldn't bring themselves to truly hate him. He was the kind of guy who would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        come over and thank you for something as trivial as a plastic bag.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Anyway, it was a big help. Just wanted to say thanks."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't mention it. Glad I could help a guy in need."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He hadn't offered to help so that Yuuta would owe him or anything. Amane smiled to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        show that he thought it was no big deal, and Yuuta smiled back, looking relieved. The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        girls in the class all squealed. Amane couldn't help but laugh bitterly as he wished that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Yuuta would save his smile for his admirers.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What did you do for Yuuta?" Itsuki asked after Yuuta left. Apparently, he had been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        watching the exchange.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Kadowaki had too much chocolate, so I gave him a couple plastic bags."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah. So he ended up with more than he expected. Shoulda come prepared." Itsuki<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smiled sympathetically.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The two of them had watched Yuuta pile up the presents and agreed that he would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        probably have a hard time making it home with the whole score. Itsuki wasn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        surprised that Amane had decided to help out.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As far as Amane was concerned, it was really just a small gesture. Nothing worth going<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out of your way to say thank you for.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, that's all it was. Nothing too important."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's just like you, man… But wait, you're keeping a bunch of old plastic bags<p></p>
        <p></p>
        around? Aren't you getting a little too engrossed in the domestic life? When I saw you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        scanning grocery store ads on your phone, I thought you were somebody's housewife."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, whose wife is that supposed to be? Last time I checked, I was still a man. Though,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I'll admit that maybe I've been heavily influenced by you-know-who…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Without a doubt, he could say it was all Mahiru's fault. The two of them were splitting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        food expenses, so he had been checking online ads, thinking he had better get the best<p></p>
        <p></p>
        deals he could, then suggesting things they could make from whatever was on sale.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, that reminded Itsuki more of a housewife than a husband. Though he did<p></p>
        <p></p>
        leave the cooking entirely up to Mahiru.<p></p>
