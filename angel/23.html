        around…"<p></p>
        "Look, you—," Amane growled.<p></p>
        "S-sorry," Mahiru mumbled.<p></p>
        He quickly shook his head. "No, you're not to blame here, Mahiru."<p></p>
        Chitose cackled merrily. "Well, as far as I'm concerned, I think it's just great that the<p></p>
        two of you are getting so friendly! It's not a bad thing at all."<p></p>
        "You're a real pain, you know that?" Amane glared. "It's seriously not what you're<p></p>
        thinking."<p></p>
        "Ohhh?"<p></p>
        "What?"<p></p>
        "Uh-uh, nothing. Nooothing at aaall!"<p></p>
        Chitose sure seemed like she had a lot to say about nothing, but she shrugged as if she<p></p>
        had no intention of expressing it through words. Amane knew that when she got like<p></p>
        this, it was no good trying to question her, so he gave up on asking her anything further.<p></p>
        Beside him, Mahiru looked slightly concerned.<p></p>
        "…Mahiru?"<p></p>
        "Huh? Oh, it's nothing."<p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to come to her senses when he spoke to her. She hurriedly put on a<p></p>
        smile and shook her head, so he knew he couldn't question her any further, either. All<p></p>
        he could do was shut his mouth.<p></p>
        "…So we made lunch as promised. Wanna eat?" Chitose asked.<p></p>
        "Sure. I can't believe I dozed off until lunch…"<p></p>
        "You slept like a log, so we had plenty of time to play around, looking at your sleeping<p></p>
        face."<p></p>
        "…I don't suppose you pulled any pranks?"<p></p>
        "I did not!" Chitose insisted, though he knew better than to believe her. "What's got<p></p>
        you so worried, young man?"<p></p>
        "You did something other than a prank, didn't you?" Amane asked suspiciously.<p></p>
        "I'm telling you: I didn't do a thing!"<p></p>
        "I wonder. Mahiru, did she do anything to the food?"<p></p>
        He looked over at Mahiru to confirm, but she must have been caught by surprise when<p></p>
        he suddenly brought up the subject. She looked confused and smiled wryly.<p></p>
        "Chitose didn't do anything, but…"<p></p>
        "Really? If she did, I'm thinking of squeezing her until she pops—"<p></p>
        "No violence!"<p></p>
        Chitose was cackling with laughter even as she protested, and Amane could only sigh<p></p>
        in exasperation.<p></p>
        Finally—though Amane didn't really feel as if any time had passed, since he had been<p></p>
        asleep—it was indeed lunchtime.<p></p>
        Even Chitose seemed to have taken her cooking seriously for a change, and the table<p></p>
        was set with a beautifully cooked quiche and a bisque soup that was giving off the rich<p></p>
        aroma of shrimp.<p></p>
        They had served everything up on individual plates, so the salad, quiche, bisque, and<p></p>
        shrimp saute were carefully arranged to show off the rich array of colors. It looked<p></p>
        like a lunch that might be served at a cute cafe .<p></p>
        "Wow, everything looks great!" Amane exclaimed. "…Mahiru, how's the flavor?"<p></p>
        "It's all fine." She nodded. "Chitose didn't add anything strange, and I tasted everything<p></p>
        as we went."<p></p>
        "Great."<p></p>
        "You really don't trust me, geez! I made everything properly today, too. Rude."<p></p>
        Chitose was in a huff, but she had a history of launching surprise attacks right after<p></p>
        saying something similar, so Amane knew better than to let his guard down. This time,<p></p>
        though, Mahiru had been there to supervise, so Amane could mostly relax and eat.<p></p>
        "Ah, Mahiru made this quiche. I made one to give to Itsuki."<p></p>
        "You're gonna give him a whole quiche…?"<p></p>
        "It's a little one, about the size of my palm, so it's fine. Eh-heh-heh, I wonder if he'll be<p></p>
        happy with it…?"<p></p>
        Chitose was wearing a big grin, and Mahiru was staring at her with a heartwarming<p></p>
        smile of her own. As long as Chitose wasn't preoccupied playing pranks or getting up<p></p>
        to some other kind of mischief, she was a pretty thoughtful girlfriend. Amane thought<p></p>
        it was nice she had made something just for Itsuki.<p></p>
        But she did tend to take things too far, so it could be a little dangerous to trust her<p></p>
        completely.<p></p>
        Amane also smiled a little at the beaming Mahiru, then turned his attention to the plate<p></p>
        that had been set before him. He pressed his hands together. "All right, let's eat."<p></p>
        "Go ahead! Enjoy your meal!"<p></p>
        Chitose looked almost bashful. It was surprisingly endearing, and just for a moment,<p></p>
        Amane was reminded that she was a girl, too, after all.<p></p>
        "…Um, I'm sorry."<p></p>
        After Chitose left, Mahiru suddenly apologized.<p></p>
        Amane wasn't sure why she was apologizing, and he looked with wide eyes at Mahiru<p></p>
        sitting beside him. She had her legs drawn in and was fidgeting restlessly, wearing a<p></p>
        guilty expression.<p></p>
        "…Sorry about the pranks."<p></p>
        "Pranks?"<p></p>
        "Chitose didn't do anything to you, but… well, I did."<p></p>
        "Huh, you did?"<p></p>
        He was certain Chitose had said she hadn't done anything when he interrogated her,<p></p>
        and Mahiru had also confirmed that Chitose hadn't. But Mahiru hadn't said a single<p></p>
        word about whether she herself had been up to no good.<p></p>
        Amane had never even considered that Mahiru might do something to him and had<p></p>
        automatically excluded her from suspicion, but apparently she had been busy.<p></p>
        She looked guilty, like she wanted to run away at any moment.<p></p>
        "What did you do?"<p></p>
        "Well, I squished your cheeks…"<p></p>
        "…Does that really qualify as a prank?"<p></p>
        "A-and then I stared at your sleeping face, and I stroked your hair."<p></p>
        "Well, you do like doing that."<p></p>
        "…Y-yes."<p></p>
        "So… was that all?"<p></p>
        "…Yes."<p></p>
        The way she was acting, she seemed remorseful, but Amane wanted to joke that those<p></p>
        things were hardly pranks. What Mahiru had done was less of a prank and more like<p></p>
        normal physical intimacy. If that was a prank, then that would mean Amane had also<p></p>
        been messing with Mahiru, so he hoped she didn't think of it that way.<p></p>
        "I'm not really mad, you know. Like, as long as you were having fun, I guess it's fine; it<p></p>
        was just careless of me to fall asleep in front of other people."<p></p>
        "Th-thank you…"<p></p>
        "I mean, I don't think it would be much fun to look at this ugly mug, but…"<p></p>
        "…You looked cute, you know?"<p></p>
        "You're just about the only person who would say a guy like me looked cute."<p></p>
        "That's not true. Chitose said so!"<p></p>
        "She was definitely making fun of me…"<p></p>
        In Chitose's case, she obviously said he looked cute because she thought it was funny.<p></p>
        That was a different matter than Mahiru finding him cute. As a rule, nobody should<p></p>
        ever take Chitose too seriously, he thought.<p></p>
        "…You really were cute."<p></p>
        "Really?"<p></p>
        "I played with your cheeks a lot…"<p></p>
        "I wonder, is it that much fun to poke at a guy's cheeks?"<p></p>
        "It's more fun than you realize."<p></p>
        Based on his own body, Amane thought guys' cheeks would be very stiff compared to<p></p>
        girls' and therefore not that much fun to poke or play with. He didn't understand what<p></p>
        Mahiru found so great about it, but if it was the very act of poking that she found<p></p>
        enjoyable, then he supposed he shouldn't complain.<p></p>
        "Well, it's not like I can't relate," he said. "Your cheeks also feel nice to poke at."<p></p>
        He had played the same "prank" on Mahiru before.<p></p>
        That said, it wouldn't do to touch her too boldly, so he cautiously, gently poked her<p></p>
        with the tip of his finger.<p></p>
        Mahiru's cheek was soft and a little squishy and undeniably feminine. She obviously<p></p>
        took very good care of her skin, because it was smooth and lustrous. Just touching her<p></p>
        like this felt amazing. Telling himself that if Mahiru had touched his face, he should be<p></p>
        allowed to touch hers, Amane gently pinched her pliable cheek.<p></p>
        Mahiru looked up at him with a bit of dissatisfaction, and he knew he'd better not<p></p>
        overdo it, so he stroked the cheek gently with the pad of his finger to mollify her. He<p></p>
        moved gently and carefully, just like he would if he were petting a kitten.<p></p>
        "…Hmm."<p></p>
        Before long, the look of dissatisfaction faded and was replaced by a soft smile that<p></p>
        seemed to be hiding something. It was such a sweet expression, he wondered if the<p></p>
        secret ingredient was plenty of honey.<p></p>
        …She looks really relaxed.<p></p>
        He was surprised to see how relaxed Mahiru looked while a boy touched her like that.<p></p>
        Then it occurred to him that Mahiru never let boys touch her, and he suddenly felt very<p></p>
        embarrassed to be receiving such special treatment. It made him want to bang his<p></p>
        head on the back of the sofa.<p></p>
        Trying to put such thoughts out of his mind, Amane reached his hand under Mahiru's<p></p>
        chin, and this time he really moved his fingers like he was petting a cat.<p></p>
        "Hyah!" She let out a small yelp. "…Wh-what was that?"<p></p>
        "Practice for when we go to the cat cafe ."<p></p>
        "What were you thinking? I'm not a cat, I'm a person!"<p></p>
        "It's because you're so catlike. But also kind of like a dog and a bunny at the same time."<p></p>
        "What are you talking about…?"<p></p>
        "Exactly what I said."<p></p>
        Recently, Amane had made the private observation that Mahiru at times acted like a<p></p>
        cat, a dog, and even a rabbit. When he was first getting to know her, she had been a<p></p>
        very wary cat, then as they became closer, she became friendly like a dog… not exactly<p></p>
        the same, but she had definitely warmed up to him. As for the rabbit… for some reason,<p></p>
        Amane had gotten it into his head that rabbits were lonely creatures, so he had just<p></p>
        thrown that one in the mix for good measure.<p></p>
        Amane was glad she didn't hate being doted on, since he wanted to do exactly that. As<p></p>
        he scratched under her chin, Mahiru quietly said "The top of my head would be better,"<p></p>
        so he obediently switched to stroking her head.<p></p>
        He decided not to mention that, at times like this, she was more doglike.<p></p>
        "…If I'm a cat and a dog and a bunny… In that case, Amane, you're a wolf."<p></p>
        "Does that mean I attack girls…?"<p></p>
        "N-no, I don't mean it like that! Wolves seem to care about their companions a lot. I've<p></p>
        heard they do anything to protect their pack. Well, since their packs are usually formed<p></p>
        of family members, I guess it's a little different, but I say that because you take really<p></p>
        good care of the people in your circle."<p></p>
        "…Well, I guess you've got me there."<p></p>
        Amane's circle of friends was pretty small. Small enough that he could count the<p></p>
        people he would call friends on two hands. But he always tried to do the best he could<p></p>
        for those people and treat them well. If she was going to call that facet of him wolflike,<p></p>
        then he wasn't going to argue.<p></p>
        "B-besides… that's how I want you to be."<p></p>
        "That's how you want me to be?"<p></p>
        "…No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it. Um, also, your hair is fluffy, which is why<p></p>
        you're like a wolf."<p></p>
        "That's not a trait of wolves."<p></p>
        Mahiru seemed like she had been about to say something different, but now she was<p></p>
        stroking Amane's hair, so he didn't question her and just let her touch his hair as she<p></p>
        pleased.<p></p>
        It was the day after the cooking class, and Mahiru apparently had plans to hang out<p></p>
        with Chitose again, so she departed after preparing Amane's lunch.<p></p>
        Amane would have been perfectly capable of feeding himself without her help, but she<p></p>
        went to all the trouble of cooking for him, so he wasn't about to complain.<p></p>
        He saw her off as she left his apartment, looking somewhat restless, then sighed as he<p></p>
        wondered how he should spend his free time.<p></p>
        It was currently just past one thirty. Mahiru had gone out, and it wasn't a bad time for<p></p>
        going out, but he didn't really feel like it since he had nothing in particular planned. If<p></p>
        he'd had plans to hang out with someone, he could have probably summoned the<p></p>
        willpower to leave the apartment, but if no one waiting for him, then he figured he<p></p>
        didn't need to go to the trouble.<p></p>
        That left him with the question of what to do with his day. There weren't that many<p></p>
        ways he could kill time at home.<p></p>
        His most frequent pastimes were games and comics, but he had cleared all the<p></p>
        scenarios in his role-playing games and even finished all the speedruns, and it wasn't<p></p>
        all that interesting to play party games by himself.<p></p>
        So he was down to comics and novels, but Amane didn't typically keep a lot of books<p></p>
        around, and he had already read the ones he had several times over and knew all the<p></p>
        plots. Amane was a fast reader anyway, so he would probably breeze through a whole<p></p>
        comic book series in an hour.<p></p>
        Amane was at a loss for what else he could do. For the moment, he went into his<p></p>
        bedroom and opened the textbook that was lying on his desk.<p></p>
        Chitose would look so confused if she could see me now.<p></p>
        Amane didn't have much to do, and they did have homework even during Golden Week.<p></p>
        And after Golden Week, midterm exams were waiting for them. He actually enjoyed<p></p>
        studying a fair bit, so he figured it might be a good way to spend his day if he didn't<p></p>
        have any other ideas.<p></p>
        One way or another, he had to get through their assigned homework, and he wanted<p></p>
        to be able to enjoy tomorrow's outing without having it in the back of his mind the<p></p>
        whole time. So he decided it was best to go ahead and get his academic obligations out<p></p>
        of the way.<p></p>
        Amane was naturally a serious student, and he pulled himself up to his desk,<p></p>
        mechanical pencil in hand, to complete his schoolwork.<p></p>
        When he next noticed the time again, it was already past six o'clock.<p></p>
        Whenever Amane was seriously concentrating, he tended to tune everything else out.<p></p>
        As he left his bedroom, rolling his shoulders around to loosen up his stiff body, he<p></p>
        smiled at how the sunbeams that were filtering through the window had changed<p></p>
        their angle bit by bit.<p></p>
        He could see the kitchen as soon as he was out in the hallway, and sure enough, there<p></p>
        was Mahiru in her apron. She hadn't been there the last time he'd left his room to take<p></p>
        a break.<p></p>
        Apparently, she had returned from her outing.<p></p>
        He wasn't sure if it was a good thing that he had been so focused he hadn't even noticed<p></p>
        the sound of the door unlocking in the entryway, but he knew it wasn't good that he<p></p>
        hadn't come out to greet her.<p></p>
        "Welcome back. Sorry I didn't greet you."<p></p>
        "No, it's fine… I didn't call out to you, either. I thought you were probably busy with<p></p>
        something in your room."<p></p>
        "I was doing homework."<p></p>
        He had made plenty of progress in the quiet apartment, but he might have been<p></p>
        studying too long, because his body was awfully stiff. He regretted not changing his<p></p>
        posture a little more often while reading.<p></p>
        He did some light stretching while they talked, and Mahiru let out a small giggle.<p></p>
        "You're very studious."<p></p>
        "I'm the type who likes to get my work done ahead of time so I can enjoy myself."<p></p>
        "I'm much the same. Though I prefer to do my studying intermittently."<p></p>
        "You're even more serious about schoolwork than I am."<p></p>
        Generally speaking, Amane was also the type to study on and off and steadily etch<p></p>
        things into his memory by repetition, but he wasn't as scrupulous and methodical as<p></p>
        Mahiru.<p></p>
        Incidentally, he had learned over the last summer break that Itsuki would finish his<p></p>
        work first and then really play around, while Chitose would play first and then drown<p></p>
        in her own tears of regret, so he expected the latter half of summer vacation this year<p></p>
        to be rough going.<p></p>
        "Once you make a habit of it, it's really not that much trouble," Mahiru explained. "Once<p></p>
        it becomes second nature, you don't think anything of it."<p></p>
        "Impressive. I've got to put in some more work, until it becomes second nature."<p></p>
        Most people assumed that Mahiru was some kind of prodigy, a genius blessed with a<p></p>
        naturally brilliant mind. Those people didn't know how hard she worked. Amane<p></p>
        would never deny that she was very smart, but he knew that, above all else, she was a<p></p>
        hard worker first and foremost.<p></p>
        She didn't show it much on the surface, but behind the scenes, she never failed to put<p></p>
        in the effort. That was why her grades and her looks and her athletics were all<p></p>
        outstanding.<p></p>
        Amane knew how hard Mahiru worked, so he recognized and admired her efforts and<p></p>
        didn't begrudge her successes. Mahiru's abilities were earned through being disciplined,<p></p>
        and anyone who wanted the same for themselves would have to put in the same labor.<p></p>
        Amane doubted he would ever be able to reach Mahiru's level, but as someone who<p></p>
        always wanted to improve his grades, he admired her.<p></p>
        Mahiru was frowning like something had tickled her. "Flattery will get you nowhere,<p></p>
        mister. At best, you might get pudding after dinner."<p></p>
        "Oh, then should I praise you more?"<p></p>
        "How calculated."<p></p>
        Mahiru smiled like something was funny. Amane gave her a sidelong glance, but when<p></p>
        he opened the refrigerator, he realized there really was pudding inside. It was
        <p></p>
        store-bought, but it came from the patisserie that Chitose liked so much,
        <p></p>
        and it was one of Amane's favorites, too. Though Mahiru's handmade pudding was the best,<p></p>
        this was also sure to be delicious. A surge of happiness bubbled up within him.<p></p>
        Mahiru giggled when she saw Amane's face light up all of a sudden, so he came back<p></p>
        to his senses and felt a bit embarrassed.<p></p>
        "You really do love eggs, don't you?"<p></p>
        "Yeah, I do."<p></p>
        There was no need to hide it in front of Mahiru, who already had a thorough<p></p>
        knowledge of his culinary preferences, so he meekly nodded in agreement.<p></p>
        Suddenly, Mahiru froze in place, still stiffly holding a potato she had just finished<p></p>
        washing. Amane tried to look at her face to see what was the matter, but she quickly<p></p>
        turned away.<p></p>
        "Mahiru?"<p></p>
        "…It's nothing. More importantly, if you're not going to help, I recommend you leave<p></p>
        the kitchen."<p></p>
        "So harsh all of a sudden. I actually came in here intending to help, but…"<p></p>
        Still, he wasn't going to make Mahiru do all the work alone. Besides, a little light<p></p>
        activity would be just perfect for waking up his stiff limbs.<p></p>
        Amane grabbed his apron from the kitchen rack and put it on. Mahiru wordlessly put<p></p>
        several washed potatoes in a bowl and handed it to him along with a peeler. She didn't<p></p>
        look him in the eye the whole time.<p></p>
        "By the way, what are we going to make with these potatoes?"<p></p>
        "…I was planning to make potato salad, but now they're going to be ingredients for a<p></p>
        frittata."<p></p>
        "Isn't that a pretty big change?"<p></p>
        "It's fine. I'm in charge of the kitchen. You just need to follow what I say."<p></p>
        "I—I don't really get it, but you make a good point."<p></p>
        This was Amane's kitchen, but Mahiru was in charge of the cooking, so this kitchen<p></p>
        was actually under Mahiru's control. After all, Amane didn't know nearly as much<p></p>
        about culinary matters as she did, so he was better off obediently following her lead.<p></p>
        Mahiru was obviously not in a good mood, and Amane wondered about her cold tone<p></p>
        as he washed his hands and began to peel the potatoes. Fortunately, he didn't need to<p></p>
        worry about injuring himself with a peeler.<p></p>
        Mahiru, meanwhile, had started her own tasks. It seemed like the change in menu had<p></p>
        been pretty sudden, but Mahiru knew what was in the refrigerator best anyway, so<p></p>
        Amane was sure there was no problem.<p></p>
        "…So what did you do today?"<p></p>
        The kitchen was spacious enough that the two of them could work side by side, and<p></p>
        he wouldn't have minded working in silence, but Amane's task wasn't that hard, so he<p></p>
        tried to strike up a conversation.<p></p>
        Mahiru's whole body twitched.<p></p>
        "Eh… um, well… I—I got her advice on something, I guess."<p></p>
        "Oh, was something giving you trouble? Did you sort it out?"<p></p>
        Honestly, Amane hoped Mahiru would come to him if she ever had a problem. But<p></p>
        there were probably a lot of issues only another girl would fully understand, so he<p></p>
        wasn't about to complain or anything.<p></p>
        "Y-yeah, sort of. I'll know for sure in a few days."<p></p>
        "Hmm. That's good, then."<p></p>
        If she had solved her problem, then Amane had nothing further to say, and he promptly<p></p>
        shut his mouth, knowing it would be bad to pry.<p></p>
        Mahiru tugged nervously at her apron.<p></p>
        "…Amane?"<p></p>
        "Hmm?"<p></p>
        "Uh, um, Amane… Which style do you like better, simple and clean or more mature?"<p></p>
        Her eyelashes fluttered as she peered at him with a troubling expression.<p></p>
        He didn't ask why she was suddenly asking him such a question. He figured she must<p></p>
        be trying to decide what kind of look was best for their outing tomorrow or something.<p></p>
        "I think it's best when the style suits the person wearing it," he finally answered.<p></p>
        "I'm asking about your preferences."<p></p>
        "I don't know what to say. It's nice to see a woman in something that really suits her,<p></p>
        but I think everyone should just wear what they feel comfortable in."<p></p>
        "…I'm asking about your preferences."<p></p>
        "Uh…"<p></p>
        Amane really thought it was best for Mahiru to wear whatever she liked, but she didn't<p></p>
        seem content to take that as his final answer.<p></p>
        "I really think either style is fine. A simple look suits your personality and looks cute,<p></p>
        and a sophisticated look brings out your beauty more. I think either one looks great<p></p>
        on you. There's something to like about each of them, but I can't say which look I like<p></p>
        better unless I see the actual outfits."<p></p>
        "…Y-you really do just come out and say things like that pretty bluntly, don't you? Agh…"<p></p>
        "I mean, you asked. Hmm, I guess go with the simple look."<p></p>
        He was getting the feeling that she wanted him to come out and pick one, so he obliged.<p></p>
        Mahiru turned away from him. "All right, I'll do that," she answered. "I'll do my best to<p></p>
        put together a look that will astonish even the calm and collected Amane."<p></p>
        "That seems like it won't end up being very simple…"<p></p>
        "Fine, I'll wear something that will make you lose your mind."<p></p>
        "Don't go too far; I won't know what to do."<p></p>
        "That's what I'm hoping." 1<p></p>
        Mahiru was being awfully forward today, but it was still adorable, just in a different<p></p>
        way. Amane chuckled to himself and continued peeling potato skins.<p></p>
        Chapter 35: An Outing with the Angel<p></p>
        "Good morning, Amane."<p></p>
        Most people would start an outing by meeting up somewhere, but Mahiru met him at<p></p>
        his apartment. Since she lived next door, they didn't need to go to the trouble of<p></p>
        arranging a meeting place. Instead, Mahiru came directly to his door.<p></p>
        She certainly did look different.<p></p>
        "Morning… Oh, you put your hair up today."<p></p>
        "I thought it would get in the way if we're going to be playing with cats. How do you<p></p>
        like it?"<p></p>
        Mahiru usually wore her long hair down, but today it was braided and gathered up in<p></p>
        a bun. It looked like a more complex version of what she did with it when she was<p></p>
        cooking.<p></p>
        "Yeah, it looks good."<p></p>
        "It's nice of you to say so, but… W-well… if you're going to laugh, just laugh, okay?"<p></p>
        "What are you talking about?"<p></p>
        "…You think it looks silly, don't you?"<p></p>
        Mahiru was squeezing her arms tightly over her chest. Her outfit showed a little bit<p></p>
        more skin than usual.<p></p>
        Putting it that way might make it seem like she was wearing a very exposing outfit,<p></p>
        but her top was a chiffon blouse with an open collar, and the pure-white skin of her<p></p>
        neck was peeking out, which just gave the illusion of more exposure.<p></p>
        The blouse had a long lantern sleeve with slits in the sides and lace panels that ran<p></p>
        along the length so her upper arms were partially hidden but still showed through. It<p></p>
        was subtly enticing.<p></p>
        Of course, she had an undershirt on, so it wasn't like he was at risk of seeing anything<p></p>
        if he looked at her from above, but somehow he found the look both tidy and alluring<p></p>
        in the way it enhanced her femininity.<p></p>
        On the bottom she was wearing skinny jeans, perhaps because she was preparing to<p></p>
        play with cats at the cafe . The jeans fit tightly to her figure, hugging her slender legs.<p></p>
        On her wrist she wore the flower bracelet Amane had given her as a present. He<p></p>
        remembered her saying she was going to wear it with care, and he felt a warmth in his<p></p>
        chest.<p></p>
        "I don't think you look silly. In fact, I think you look even prettier than usual."<p></p>
        "Well, don't you look the part today? Your parents must have raised you to be a proper<p></p>
        gentleman."<p></p>
        "Dad always told me that you ought to compliment a girl when she's all dressed up…<p></p>
        Of course, it's not just flattery, you know."<p></p>
        "…I'll believe you."<p></p>
        Mahiru's face flushed slightly red, and she held her bag tight. Amane smiled wryly and<p></p>
        almost patted her head, but he stopped himself. He expected she wouldn't be pleased<p></p>
        if he messed up her elaborate hairdo before they even started their outing.<p></p>
        Mahiru blinked like she'd been expecting it but seemed to understand he was being<p></p>
        considerate of her hair, and so she smiled at him. She did give Amane's hand a bit of a<p></p>
        wary look, though.<p></p>
        "…Amane, recently you've been a little obsessed with patting my head, haven't you?"<p></p>
        "If you don't like it, I'll stop. I know I shouldn't touch you too excessively."<p></p>
        "N-no, that's not what I meant… I, um, I want to be able to play with your hair, too,<p></p>
        when I want to."<p></p>
        "That's fine; I don't mind, but you can't do it now. I've got wax in it."<p></p>
        Amane had donned his "mystery man" outfit to go out with Mahiru, taking the time to<p></p>
        carefully arrange his hair. His outfit choice was relaxed, consisting of a denim jacket<p></p>
        over a white V-neck shirt plus some slim black trousers. It was obviously not as much<p></p>
        effort as Mahiru had gone to, but Amane was used to looking like a slob next to her,<p></p>
        and this time he'd at least tried.<p></p>
        "…So I can touch your hair?"<p></p>
        "I don't really mind, but for today, let's make do with petting cats."<p></p>
        "I—I didn't mean I wanted to do it right now, you know. I can do it later, I guess…"<p></p>
        "I've been doing it to you, so it's only natural that you should get a chance. Fair<p></p>
        turnabout and all."<p></p>
        He didn't particularly dislike it when Mahiru touched his hair… If anything, it felt really<p></p>
        nice, and if Mahiru enjoyed it, he was happy to let her continue. Mahiru had seemed<p></p>
        flustered at first by Amane agreeing so easily, but now she was finally wearing a happy<p></p>
        smile.<p></p>
        "…Okay, then we're agreed: I'll do it later. For now, let's go pet lots of cats."<p></p>
        "Sure."<p></p>
        "Off we go, then?"<p></p>
        "Mm."<p></p>
        Thinking that setting out together from the same apartment felt a little embarrassing<p></p>
        somehow, Amane left his place with Mahiru.<p></p>
        As they walked side by side, the thought occurred to Amane to extend his hand to her.<p></p>
        "Here, have a hand," he said lightheartedly.<p></p>
        Mahiru flushed faintly and smiled as she squeezed his hand.<p></p>
        He had done a degree of preliminary investigation, but when they actually entered the<p></p>
        cat cafe , it was much more spacious than Amane had imagined.<p></p>
        After the two had signed in and used hand sanitizer, they stepped into the main cafe<p></p>
        area. As expected, they could see cats everywhere, walking around or curled into balls<p></p>
        or playing with other patrons.<p></p>
        "Wow… It's pretty big. And clean."<p></p>
        The cafe offered food and drinks, so perhaps it was to be expected, but the cleanliness<p></p>
        of the place still surprised him. He could barely smell any of the scents characteristic<p></p>
        of many places where animals made their home. In fact, it was nearly odorless.<p></p>
        He had looked at the reviews online, and this seemed to be a cat cafe that was prized<p></p>
        for its hygiene and took good care of its cats. It was a popular place, but to keep the<p></p>
        cats from getting stressed, it had only a few seats. There were also many hideouts for<p></p>
        the cats, and in the end, the cafe seemed to be set up less for touching the cats than for<p></p>
        sharing the space with them.<p></p>
        This cafe had a time-limit system, and the fees were high, but it was such a beautiful<p></p>
        and calm space that he didn't mind paying at all.<p></p>
        "Whoa… cats… Look, Amane, they're all so cute!"<p></p>
        There were cats with the other customers, so Mahiru spoke in a quiet voice, but he<p></p>
        could hear her eager excitement as she tugged on his sleeve. There were all sorts of<p></p>
        cats around, and Mahiru's eyes sparkled as she looked at them eagerly.<p></p>
        The topic of animals had never really come up, but apparently she really liked cats.<p></p>
        She was so excited, Amane could feel his mouth curling into a smile.<p></p>
        "You're right; they're really cute."<p></p>
        "So cute!" Mahiru didn't seem to realize how cute she was being herself as she looked<p></p>
        at the profile chart she had received from the receptionist, listing the cats' names and<p></p>
        breeds along with photos. She pointed to the Siamese cat beside her. "Ah, that one's<p></p>
        name is Silky!"<p></p>
        Only the fur on its tail and around its face was black, while the rest of the coat on its<p></p>
        long, slender body was a dazzling white. It had characteristic blue eyes and exuded an<p></p>
        air of nobility.<p></p>
        Mahiru was itching to pet it, but suddenly touching the cats was prohibited, so she<p></p>
        kept an eye on it from the side as she slowly brought her fingers closer to its nose and<p></p>
        let it sniff her.<p></p>
        The cat's nose twitched.<p></p>
        She didn't say it out loud, but Mahiru clearly thought even that was cute, so she<p></p>
        definitely seemed to like cats a lot.<p></p>
        But after getting a full sniff of Mahiru's scent, Silky abruptly and gracefully dashed<p></p>
        away.<p></p>
        Mahiru was clearly disheartened.<p></p>
        "That doesn't necessarily mean she hates you; I think she was just done saying hello."<p></p>
        "R-right, I suppose that's fair…"<p></p>
        "Come on, I think we should let the cats take their time and get used to us. Let's go<p></p>
        have a seat for now, okay?"<p></p>
        Mahiru stood back up, he took her hand, and they sat down on an open sofa. Once there,<p></p>
        Amane finally took a slow look around the whole room and saw that there certainly<p></p>
        were a lot of types of cats.<p></p>
        The cat from a moment ago had been a Siamese, but there were American shorthairs,<p></p>
        Russian blues, munchkins, Bengals, and even more exotic breeds—cats with great<p></p>
        individuality here, there, and everywhere.<p></p>
        At the next seat over, a short distance from them, an American shorthair was curled<p></p>
        up on the table, and the girl sitting there was gently stroking it.<p></p>
        "So cute…"<p></p>
        Mahiru was looking at the other customers without bothering to disguise the envy in<p></p>
        her eyes. Amane smiled wryly and looked over the menu.<p></p>
        The food and drink offerings at this cafe were supposed to be delicious.<p></p>
        The top recommendation seemed to be a latte with a cat design on top, formed out of<p></p>
        the milk foam. Apparently, the staff was talented at making latte art, and many people<p></p>
        had uploaded pictures.<p></p>
        Amane left Mahiru to her own devices for a moment, as she was staring at a cat<p></p>
        loitering nearby, and he called the waiter over and ordered the signature latte art.<p></p>
        "I went ahead and ordered you the same thing as me, is that all right?" he asked when<p></p>
        he had finished.<p></p>
        "Huh? Ah yes, that's fine."<p></p>
        As expected, Mahiru was so preoccupied with the cats that she hadn't even noticed<p></p>
        him ordering. Mahiru was the type who could drink coffee or tea, so since this was a<p></p>
        special outing, he decided to keep the order a secret and give her a little surprise.<p></p>
        After a short while, their order was brought over. Slowly, so as not to destroy the latte<p></p>
        art, their smiling waiter set the cups down on the table, bowed, and left. Mahiru<p></p>
        couldn't take her eyes off the latte art atop her cup.<p></p>
        "Is this okay?"<p></p>
        "Y-yes, it's super cute…"<p></p>
        "I'm glad."<p></p>
        On Mahiru's drink, the milk foam had been poured with great care to form a cat that<p></p>
        was curled up asleep, its coat pattern and expression drawn with cocoa powder. In<p></p>
        Amane's cup, they had drawn a cat leaning against the rim. The cute, dainty depictions<p></p>
        of the cats made it easy to understand why the cafe had become so popular.<p></p>
        Perhaps to preserve the excitement, Mahiru was taking photos with her smartphone<p></p>
        and looking quite pleased, but then for some reason her expression turned. "It's so<p></p>
        cute I can't drink it…," she muttered.<p></p>
        She sounded so serious. Amane couldn't help but laugh.<p></p>
        "D-don't laugh at me, please."<p></p>
        "It's just—you're so troubled over something so adorable."<p></p>
        "B-but… it would be such a waste to destroy it when there's such a cute little cat…"<p></p>
        "But it would be even more of a waste not to drink it."<p></p>
        "Oh no."<p></p>
        It wasn't that he didn't understand Mahiru's feelings, but the foam would collapse<p></p>
        anyway even if she left it alone, and he presumed that the person who made the coffee<p></p>
        would probably be happier if she drank it before it got cold.<p></p>
        After sufficiently appreciating his own latte cat, Amane raised his cup without<p></p>
        hesitation. He almost laughed again when he heard a murmur of sadness from beside<p></p>
        him, but somehow he contained it enough to slowly sip his caffe latte.<p></p>
        Mahiru looked so downhearted that he tried his best to drink without disturbing the<p></p>
        cat too much. The latte itself was delicious. The combination of the deep coffee flavor<p></p>
        and the rich milk was just perfect. And it wasn't too sweet, so Amane, who drank his<p></p>
        coffee black, didn't mind it.<p></p>
        "Mm, it's good."<p></p>
        When he took a break from drinking and made this comment, Mahiru groaned slightly<p></p>
        but brought her cup to her lips with some hesitation.<p></p>
        She looked funny and cute drinking her latte and carefully trying to not destroy the<p></p>
        cat, and Amane's lips must have curled into an unintentional smile.<p></p>
        "I—I feel like you're laughing at me, but—"<p></p>
        "You're imagining things. Is it good?"<p></p>
        "Yes, it is, of course."<p></p>
        When Amane looked at Mahiru once she had pulled her mouth away from the cup and<p></p>
        set it back down, he couldn't control himself, and his shoulders shook with laughter.<p></p>
        "Wh-why are you laughing?"<p></p>
        "Well, you have a white moustache."<p></p>
        She must have failed to pay attention to the rest of the milk foam in her efforts to keep<p></p>
        the cat intact, for Mahiru's upper lip was now decorated with a white moustache<p></p>
        reminiscent of Santa Claus.<p></p>
        She looked so extremely cute that he instinctively snapped a photo with his phone.<p></p>
        "Uh, d-did you just take a picture?!"<p></p>
        "Sorry. Do you want me to delete it?"<p></p>
        "W-were you planning on keeping a record of such a shameful face?"<p></p>
        "You looked cute, so I just took it."<p></p>
        When he said that, Mahiru pressed her lips together tightly, and her face flushed red.<p></p>
        In a quiet voice, she grumbled, "…You can have the one photo."<p></p>
        She was still wearing the white moustache as she told him that, so Amane felt his chest<p></p>
        growing warm as he held back a laugh and nodded in agreement.<p></p>
        "…Ah!"<p></p>
        Around the time they finished drinking their caffe lattes decorated with foam art, one<p></p>
        of the cats jumped up on Amane's lap.<p></p>
        It was the American shorthair that had been at the neighboring seat earlier.<p></p>
        After checking out the profile sheet, they saw that it said CACAO, FEMALE.<p></p>
        Amane wasn't sure whether she was friendly or just shameless, but she had suddenly<p></p>
        gotten up on his lap, which he found perplexing. He was fully aware that cats did as<p></p>
        they pleased, but he was slightly unsettled to be approached so suddenly.<p></p>
        The warmth in his lap was more profound than he had expected, as the cat confidently<p></p>
        curled up and settled in as if to say this was her spot.<p></p>
        "This one is really friendly."<p></p>
        He looked over at Mahiru as the cat sniffed at his fingers and thought she seemed<p></p>
        incredibly jealous.<p></p>
        Once Cacao had finished sniffing to her heart's content, she nuzzled her face into<p></p>
        Amane's palm, so he figured she was asking him to pet her and started scratching her<p></p>
        under her chin like he had practiced on Mahiru.<p></p>
        He could tell from the vibration and the sound that she was purring.<p></p>
        Feeling relaxed by the presence of the cute cat, Amane ruffled the fur under her chin<p></p>
        as he petted her, but he felt jealous eyes on him from Mahiru sitting next to him and<p></p>
        chuckled to himself again.<p></p>
        "Mahiru, put out your hand."<p></p>
        "Huh? R-right."<p></p>
        She obediently stretched out her hand, so Amane removed his own hand from Cacao<p></p>
        and, in its place, put Mahiru's palm near Cacao's face.<p></p>
        This cat is probably friendly and used to humans, so she ought to allow herself to be<p></p>
        petted after a proper greeting.<p></p>
        Cacao sniffed at Mahiru's hand, then let out a somewhat listless meeeow and rubbed<p></p>
        her face against Mahiru's palm. Mahiru's eyes sparkled, overcome with emotion.<p></p>
        "Amane, she let me pet her!"<p></p>
        Mahiru smiled gleefully at Amane as she finally got to pet a cat, stroking the fur in the<p></p>
        right direction.<p></p>
        Perhaps a sign of how carefully the cats were looked after, Cacao's fur was shiny and<p></p>
        incredibly soft. She didn't smell bad, either, and had just a faint hint of cat odor. She<p></p>
        was obviously treasured dearly by the staff.<p></p>
        All the cats had nice coats and looked healthy, and there weren't any that were<p></p>
        extremely fat or too thin. And all the lively cats were free to move about as they pleased.<p></p>
        "…So cute."<p></p>
        "They really are, aren't they?… I'm jealous of you, Amane…"<p></p>
        "How about you call Cacao over to you? Tell her to come sit in your lap."<p></p>
        The cats couldn't understand words, but gestures seemed to communicate surprisingly<p></p>
        well.<p></p>
        As a test, Mahiru patted her lap and called "Come here," and Cacao meowed once, then<p></p>
        slowly moved over to sit on the offered spot.<p></p>
        Mahiru's expression of excitement at that moment was so full of joy that just seeing it<p></p>
        was enough to make Amane happy, too.<p></p>
        "Look, she sat on me!"<p></p>
        "That's great. Hey, she wants you to pet her."<p></p>
        Cacao must have preferred Mahiru's soft lap over Amane's hard one, for she meowed<p></p>
        even louder than before and pushed her face into Mahiru's palm.<p></p>
        Smiling at the beaming Mahiru, who was rubbing the cat to her heart's content, Amane<p></p>
        captured the moment with his smartphone.<p></p>
        "Is this photo all right?"<p></p>
        "…This one's okay," Mahiru said as she stroked Cacao.<p></p>
        Amane kept smiling at her and stood up.<p></p>
        Along the wall were bookshelves filled with magazines and comics, so he intended to<p></p>
        bring several of them back to the table.<p></p>
        This place was called a cat cafe , but that didn't mean one would constantly be playing<p></p>
        with cats. His main goal was to spend a comfortable time in a space where there were<p></p>
        cats around, so relaxing with some reading material was also an option.<p></p>
        While Mahiru was absorbed in petting Cacao, Amane chose something to read from<p></p>
        the shelves without much thought. That was when he noticed that Silky, the cat that<p></p>
        had greeted Mahiru when they first came in, was at his feet.<p></p>
        He crouched down and put his index finger near her nose, and as expected, she sniffed<p></p>
        him in greeting.<p></p>
        This gesture was quite adorable, so his cheeks softened into another smile as he<p></p>
        watched her fondly. When she was done smelling him, Silky lifted a front paw and<p></p>
        leaned against him, as if she was going to leap into his arms.<p></p>
        Silky meowed in a higher pitch than Cacao and touched him again, so Amane sat crosslegged on the floor.<p></p>
        The cat had a high-class aura but seemed to be comfortable around people, and she<p></p>
        was allowing him to pet her. When he tried stroking her, she put on a very satisfied<p></p>
        expression.<p></p>
        She was purring and nuzzling him, so he took that as a sign that she wanted him to pet<p></p>
        her more. In accordance with the wishes of the noble Lady Silky, he gently and carefully<p></p>
        stroked her back.<p></p>
        There was a cat at Itsuki's house, so he understood how to do the petting. He watched<p></p>
        Silky carefully and adjusted his motions to keep her happy and docile.<p></p>
        So cute…<p></p>
        He could feel her purring, and another gentle smile soon slipped onto his lips. At first,<p></p>
        she had behaved a bit coldly, so he hadn't expected her to be so permissive and fawning.<p></p>
        Now that I think about it, she's kind of like Mahiru.<p></p>
        Mahiru had also been cold and standoffish at first, but once she let her guard down,<p></p>
        she started gazing at him with trust in her eyes, fawning over him, and getting<p></p>
        comfortable. In that way, she had reminded him of a cat.<p></p>
        Inwardly bestowing Silky with the moniker Angel Two, Amane enjoyed petting her.<p></p>
        Suddenly, he heard the sound of a camera shutter. He looked up and saw that Mahiru<p></p>
        had approached without him noticing and taken a picture with her smartphone.<p></p>
        "I thought you were taking a while… So you made friends with Silky, huh?"<p></p>
        "I don't know why, but she came over to see me."<p></p>
        "You're so stingy… I want to pet her, too…"<p></p>
        "What happened to Cacao?"<p></p>
        "Cats have a mind of their own…"<p></p>
        Apparently, the cat had gone off somewhere.<p></p>
        He looked around the cafe and saw Cacao curled up on the second story of a cat tower.<p></p>
        Just a moment ago, she had been sitting with Mahiru, but she must have changed her<p></p>
        mind.<p></p>
        "Is Silky your favorite, Amane?"<p></p>
        "Well, I haven't petted all of them yet to really start comparing… But yeah, she kind of<p></p>
        resembles you, so I'd like to keep petting her."<p></p>
        "Resembles me?"<p></p>
        "I mean, you were pretty standoffish at first, kind of cold and blunt, but once you<p></p>
        decided you liked me, you warmed up quickly."<p></p>
        Sure, it was catlike for her to let her guard down and fawn on him, but he thought that<p></p>
        the way she trusted him and relished his attention was more doglike, so he thought of<p></p>
        her as a cross between a cat and dog.<p></p>
        Mahiru didn't seem to realize just how badly she was spoiling him, which made Amane<p></p>
        feel happy yet embarrassed at the same time.<p></p>
        "…I am not a cat. Besides, it's not like I get attached to just anyone."<p></p>
        "Well, that's because you're very wary."<p></p>
        "…You haven't been thinking of me as a cat?"<p></p>
        "I haven't, I haven't," he answered, stroking the cat in his lap the same way he always<p></p>
        patted Mahiru. "Right?" he sought Silky's agreement.<p></p>
        Either she was good at reading the room, or it was just a coincidence, but Silky<p></p>
        meowed, right on cue so even Mahiru couldn't press the matter any further.<p></p>
        But Mahiru looked at him with a fairly dissatisfied expression, so Amane used his<p></p>
        unoccupied left hand to stroke Mahiru's head.<p></p>
        "…So you do think of me as a cat."<p></p>
        "Sort of. Here, how about you play with Silky? It looks like they'll lend you some toys<p></p>
        if you go to the front desk."<p></p>
        "You're not getting out of this that easily."<p></p>
        "…So you don't want to play with her, then?" he asked as he teased the cat.<p></p>
        Mahiru pouted slightly and grumbled "You don't play fair, Amane," then headed for the<p></p>
        front desk to borrow some cat toys.<p></p>
        Amane had been planning to switch places with her and go to the desk himself, so he<p></p>
        watched her with wide eyes, then tilted his head in confusion as he recalled Mahiru's<p></p>
        expression, which had been a little sulky for some reason.<p></p>
        "What does that mean, I don't play fair?… Is she talking about playing with Silky?" He<p></p>
        muttered as he pondered the reason for Mahiru's sour expression, but the cat just<p></p>
        meowed as if to say "How should I know?" and nestled its head in his palm again.<p></p>
        Ultimately, the reason for Mahiru's pouting wasn't really clear, but as she played with<p></p>
        the cats, her mood quickly improved, and she was soon smiling at him again.<p></p>
        After a certain point, Mahiru stopped paying attention to Amane and focused entirely<p></p>
        on the cats. He smiled wryly as he watched her play, but for some reason, the cats kept<p></p>
        settling into Amane's lap.<p></p>
        Mahiru saw this and started sulking again, but Silky, as if to say "There's no helping it,"<p></p>
        moved over to sit on Mahiru's thighs, and all was well again.<p></p>
        There must have been something about Amane that the cats appreciated, because as<p></p>
        he was petting them, even though he had no treats to give, other cats continued to<p></p>
        swarm around him.<p></p>
        Eventually, though, they reached the end of their allotted time in the cafe . The two of<p></p>
        them used lint rollers to remove cat hair from their clothes and washed their hands,<p></p>
        and as Amane finished, Mahiru went to get the bill, then looked at him with<p></p>
        dissatisfaction.<p></p>
        "Why are you making that face?" he asked.<p></p>
        "You didn't have to go to the trouble of doing that."<p></p>
        "It's no trouble. It's for my own satisfaction, so don't worry about it." Amane had gone<p></p>
        ahead and paid for everything already, so she didn't have to. "Actually, think of it as my<p></p>
        way of saying thanks for coming with me to a cat cafe , a place I never would have gone<p></p>
        into alone. Okay?"<p></p>
        "…But—"<p></p>
        "Let me treat you in situations like this. If you don't agree, then… All right, how about<p></p>
        coming with me again to make it even?"<p></p>
        "…I can't do anything but agree to that, can I?"<p></p>
        "Well, I'm for this plan, too, so it's a win-win. No problem!"<p></p>
        Mahiru pressed her lips together tightly and nudged Amane's upper arm, then<p></p>
        squeezed Amane's hand again.<p></p>
        Amane and Mahiru had lunch at a restaurant they had picked out in advance, one with<p></p>
        a good reputation, before heading to the shopping mall. It was a popular restaurant,<p></p>
        and as expected, the food was tasty, just like the reviews reported. Perhaps it was a<p></p>
        simple matter of opinion, but Amane still thought Mahiru's cooking edged out ahead,<p></p>
        confirming once more that hers was the very best.<p></p>
        Seeing as how it was Golden Week, there were quite a few more customers in the mall<p></p>
        than there might have been on a typical weekday, so gripping tightly onto Mahiru's<p></p>
        hand, Amane stopped beside a wall so they could figure out where they wanted to go<p></p>
        before diving into the crowds.<p></p>
        "So then, what will we do in the mall? You mentioned shopping, but is there something<p></p>
        in particular you want to buy?"<p></p>
        "N-nothing specific, but um, I thought it sounded fun to have a look around together…<p></p>
        I-is that all right?"<p></p>
        "Yeah, that's fine. I'm good with window-shopping."<p></p>
        At home, he had often been dragged around by his mother, and his family would also<p></p>
        sometimes go out shopping, so he had built up a tolerance to an activity that some<p></p>
        found fairly agonizing.<p></p>
        Besides, it wouldn't be a bad idea to get a look at some things that Mahiru wanted to<p></p>
        see.<p></p>
        "Where do you want to start? There are all sorts of shops—variety goods, clothes,<p></p>
        interior decorating…"<p></p>
        This enormous shopping complex had an almost uncountable number of clothing and<p></p>
        accessory stores, restaurants, variety shops, and entertainment facilities all crammed<p></p>
        in wall-to-wall; so many stores over such a wide area that they couldn't possibly see it<p></p>
        all in one day. Since it would be impossible to look around the entire mall, he had to<p></p>
        get her to provide at least some direction.<p></p>
        "All right… Can we start with clothes?"<p></p>
        "Sure. You buying a new outfit?"<p></p>
        "I want to buy something, if there's anything good. They've got this summer's styles<p></p>
        out, so I'd like to get some new clothes."<p></p>
        "Summer, huh…? That came quickly."<p></p>
        The sweaty season was about to start, but even so, it was still the time of year when<p></p>
        the sunlight was warm and cheerful, so he thought it was a bit hasty to switch over to<p></p>
        summer clothes just yet. The stores, of course, had to anticipate the approaching<p></p>
        season, but still, Amane couldn't shake the springtime feeling.<p></p>
        "This summer… Uh, you'll be coming home with me… will you?"<p></p>
        "Ah y-yes. If it's all right with you and your parents, that is." She seemed to remember<p></p>
        the earlier conversation about coming with him to his parents' home the next time he<p></p>
        went, and she nodded eagerly.<p></p>
        "I asked my mom once more after we talked, and she said you're definitely welcome.<p></p>
        Actually, she insisted I bring you."<p></p>
        His parents would probably agree to let her stay even if he didn't check with them first,<p></p>
        but they would have to get a room ready and everything, so he had made sure to ask<p></p>
        ahead, and they'd promised to give her a warm welcome.<p></p>
        He was certain to hear complaints from his mother if he showed up without her, so he<p></p>
        was grateful for Mahiru's enthusiasm.<p></p>
        "Well, my hometown's not that impressive, you know. Although, I guess there's plenty<p></p>
        to do."<p></p>
        "Really?"<p></p>
        "Well, my mother never had trouble finding a new place to drag me. There's a shopping<p></p>
        mall like this one, a ridiculously huge wilderness park, a stupidly large water park, just<p></p>
        general stuff like that."<p></p>
        Amane's hometown was in a nice, central location, not too urban and not too rural, so<p></p>
        it was a place where people wouldn't get bored in the summer or winter. Far from it,<p></p>
        there were so many things to do that it was a distinct danger to be dragged around<p></p>
        from place to place and not have any time to be alone.<p></p>
        The water park would be open in the summer, so it would feel really nice to go on the<p></p>
        slides and swim around and relax. There was also a large water park in the area where<p></p>
        they were living now, so they could probably also go swim there right after the start<p></p>
        of summer vacation.<p></p>
        Amane wasn't especially good at sports, but he didn't have anything against being<p></p>
        active. He liked to swim, so it would probably be nice to go by himself, too. There was<p></p>
        no way that he could tell Mahiru he'd like to go to the pool with her, because the<p></p>
        invitation would sound too much like he had an obvious ulterior motive.<p></p>
        "Swimming is optional at our school, so if you don't take it, you don't get the chance to<p></p>
        swim, so it might be nice to go swimming. If you want to, you could go with my mom…<p></p>
        Mahiru?"<p></p>
        "Uh, no, it's nothing…"<p></p>
        "Ah, don't worry. I'm not thinking that I want to see you in a swimsuit or anything rude<p></p>
        like that."<p></p>
        "I d-didn't think you were. A p-pool, huh?"<p></p>
        "Is there something wrong with that?"<p></p>
        Amane always thought of swimming pools in the summertime, and not in a weird way<p></p>
        or anything, but Mahiru shook her head with slightly stiff movements.<p></p>
        "W-well… umm…"<p></p>
        "Hmm?"<p></p>
        "A-as long as I don't have to swim, um… I could consider going…"<p></p>
        "…Is it possible that you don't know how to swim?"<p></p>
        She blatantly refused to meet his eyes. Apparently, he had been right on the money.<p></p>
        "…I honestly thought you could do literally anything."<p></p>
        "O-of course I can't do everything. Swimming is optional, so I thought I could get by<p></p>
        without telling anyone."<p></p>
        Her face was turning redder by the second. She was obviously embarrassed.<p></p>
        "I don't know what to say; I didn't expect that…"<p></p>
        "Th-that's enough about swimming already, isn't it? Come on, let's go."<p></p>
        Mahiru didn't seem to want him to dwell on the fact that she couldn't swim, and with<p></p>
        a very red face, she tugged at his hand. Well, not exactly tugged—she pressed her body<p></p>
        against his arm and squeezed it tightly. It was clear she was trying to push him to get<p></p>
        started with their window-shopping because she wanted to avoid the topic, but she<p></p>
        couldn't find any traction.<p></p>
        All the fabric on the clothes in the shops was more lightweight, to match the changing<p></p>
        seasons as the weather gradually got warmer. The chiffon blouse Mahiru had on that<p></p>
        day, for example, was very light and thin, and it had a wide collar, exposing much of<p></p>
        her neck and shoulders. And Amane discovered at this moment that he was at just the<p></p>
        right angle to see directly down the front of her undershirt.<p></p>
        But he had a feeling that if he pointed that out right now, she would run away in a huff,<p></p>
        so instead he kept his mouth shut and gently extracted his arm from Mahiru's grasp,<p></p>
        then firmly took her by the hand.<p></p>
        Frankly, he wouldn't have minded being able to enjoy the view for a little while longer,<p></p>
        but his feelings of guilt took over and internally he derided himself for being a<p></p>
        spineless loser. 1<p></p>
        "I hear you, I hear you. Don't run; you'll fall."<p></p>
        "…I'm not a child."<p></p>
        Mahiru thankfully turned away, apparently unaware of Amane's agitation, and Amane,<p></p>
        too, turned to look outside, hoping to escape her gaze for a bit.<p></p>
        Desperately trying to drive the lingering feeling of that softness pressing up against<p></p>
        his arm out of his mind, Amane sighed quietly enough that Mahiru couldn't hear.<p></p>
        Amane gazed down the long row of shops as Mahiru tugged him along by the hand,<p></p>
        but once again, all he could think about was how much attention she attracted.<p></p>
        She possessed a simple and clean beauty that befitted her nickname of "the angel." But<p></p>
        right now, Mahiru was exuding an aura of carefree joy that made him want to wrap his<p></p>
        arms around her.<p></p>
        In angel mode, Mahiru had the beauty and ephemerality of a painting and made<p></p>
        onlookers feel like she must not be touched or interfered with. However, that was a<p></p>
        fragile, artificial kind of beauty, and Amane knew it wasn't who she really was. The girl<p></p>
        holding his hand was wearing a genuine, carefree smile and brimming with life.<p></p>
        Without her even saying a word, he could tell from her expression and the way she<p></p>
        held his hand, and even the way she walked, that she was having a lot of fun.<p></p>
        Her usual restrained smile was beautiful, too, but he thought she looked much cuter<p></p>
        when she let her feelings show on her face and smiled with her whole being, rather<p></p>
        than keeping it all bottled up.<p></p>
        "…Is something the matter?" she suddenly asked.<p></p>
        "No," he answered. "I was just thinking that we get a lot of stares when we're walking<p></p>
        together."<p></p>
        Both men and women were turning to look at them as they passed, which really drove<p></p>
        home the reality of Mahiru's beauty.<p></p>
        "…I don't think I'm the only one they're looking at, you know?"<p></p>
        "Well, I'm sure some of them are taking the time to size up the guy escorting you."<p></p>
        "That's not what I mean, geez!"<p></p>
        She looked up at him with disappointment but didn't seem inclined to elaborate, only<p></p>
        squeezing his hand tightly again. He heard her mumble quietly, "His self-esteem is a<p></p>
        real problem…"<p></p>
        But Amane knew that if he was with Mahiru, he would be under strict scrutiny, and it<p></p>
        was also obvious that he could never compare favorably to her, so this wasn't really an<p></p>
        issue of self-esteem or anything like that, as far as he was concerned.<p></p>
        "All right, listen up," Mahiru said. "I'll try to say this as frankly as possible so you can<p></p>
        understand."<p></p>
        "Huh? What's with that voice? Scary."<p></p>
        "How rude…" She pressed on his nose with her index finger and silenced him. "This is<p></p>
        your own fault, you know?"<p></p>
        But instead of pouting, Mahiru wore a teasing smile as she repeatedly poked at<p></p>
        Amane's nose, then pulled away once satisfied and tugged on Amane's hand. Actually,<p></p>
        it would be more accurate to say she pressed up against his arm again.<p></p>
        "…Things would move along a lot faster if you just had a little confidence," Mahiru<p></p>
        grumbled, putting her forehead against his upper arm.<p></p>
        Amane couldn't stand it. He had to look away.<p></p>
        …It's not on purpose; she doesn't mean it.<p></p>
        Amane was trying not to think about the softness pressed up against him. He tried to<p></p>
        politely open up some distance between them, but Mahiru clutched his arm as if to tell<p></p>
        him not to go anywhere.<p></p>
        He shuddered, thinking that if this was all intentional, she was acting like quite the<p></p>
        little devil. But he was convinced she wasn't aware of what she was doing, so he<p></p>
        shuddered for a different reason.<p></p>
        If things continued this way, he was going to blow his top, so Amane somehow turned<p></p>
        his conscious mind to other things and took an easy look around at the area. Exactly<p></p>
        when he needed it, he spotted a store lined with racks of understated clothes that<p></p>
        Mahiru might like.<p></p>
        "Hey, the clothes on that mannequin seem like they would suit you. Want to go take a<p></p>
        look?"<p></p>
        He pointed out the shop with his free hand, hoping to divert attention from the fire<p></p>
        currently searing his cheeks, and Mahiru asked, "Are those the sorts of clothes you like,<p></p>
        Amane?" She seemed interested, so their feet naturally led them toward the shop.<p></p>
        "How about this one?"<p></p>
        "Yeah, well, you look good in everything, but something like this does seems like it<p></p>
        would suit you in particular."<p></p>
        The mannequin was dressed in an off-the-shoulder dress with thin stripes on a white<p></p>
        field. It was summer clothing, so the fabric was fairly thin, and the shoulders were<p></p>
        exposed. It looked cool and comfortable for warm-weather outings.<p></p>
        This style of clothing looked really good on women who were slender and had pretty<p></p>
        de colletage, so he was sure it would look great on Mahiru. He mentally dressed her in<p></p>
        the outfit as she stood there next to the mannequin and was immediately able to<p></p>
        imagine her looking light and breezy in it. It was a look that would go well with a straw<p></p>
        hat.<p></p>
        "I'll just go try it on, okay?"<p></p>
        Mahiru picked up one of the same from a rack of dresses hanging next to the<p></p>
        mannequin, as if she had either decided quickly or had always been planning to try it<p></p>
        on.<p></p>
        Amane was a bit taken aback by her sudden enthusiasm. He accepted the bag she<p></p>
        entrusted to him, and she immediately disappeared into the fitting room.<p></p>
        He waited for Mahiru to change clothes, baffled by her excitement, and ended up even<p></p>
        more baffled because for some reason he kept finding himself on the receiving end of<p></p>
        warm looks from people nearby. It wasn't just the store clerk—the other customers<p></p>
        were smiling at him pleasantly, which made Amane extremely uncomfortable.<p></p>
        As he waited for Mahiru, he wished from the bottom of his heart that she would return<p></p>
        soon. Finally, the fitting room curtain opened, and Mahiru stepped out.<p></p>
        But she hadn't changed into the dress.<p></p>
        "Welcome back… You didn't put it on?"<p></p>
        "No, I put it on and checked the size. But… Well, I can't show it to you right now,<p></p>
        because I don't have on the right underwear…"<p></p>
        "S-sorry I asked."<p></p>
        The chiffon blouse she was currently wearing also showed a fair amount of cleavage,<p></p>
        but not as much as an off-the-shoulder dress. It sounded like she needed to have on<p></p>
        different underthings than usual when wearing clothes that exposed so much<p></p>
        shoulder, so she wasn't ready to immediately show him the dress.<p></p>
        "But you were kind enough to point out that it would suit me, and I put it on and liked<p></p>
        it, so I'm buying it."<p></p>
        She took her bag back from him and went to the register with the dress in her arms,<p></p>
        so Amane followed her in a fluster.<p></p>
        He started fishing his wallet out, thinking he ought to pay for it, since he was the one<p></p>
        who said it would suit Mahiru, but she stopped him as she was already groping around<p></p>
        in her own bag.<p></p>
        "You can't pay. I need to buy this myself and show it off to you."<p></p>
        "O-oh."<p></p>
        "Though I won't be able to wear it until it gets warmer. I'll hold on to it until summer.<p></p>
        You can look forward to seeing it."<p></p>
        She looked bashful as she finished paying, and Amane shut his mouth tight and tried<p></p>
        desperately to resist the urge to collapse on the spot.<p></p>
        Dammit, she's saying such ridiculously cute things. It sounds like she's saying she's going<p></p>
        to wear it just for me. My heart can't take this.<p></p>
        He caught the eye of the store clerk who was taking Mahiru's payment, and she smiled<p></p>
        at him with a truly friendly expression, so Amane couldn't do anything but bite his lip<p></p>
        and avert his eyes.<p></p>
        Amane and Mahiru had enjoyed window-shopping together—actually, since they'd<p></p>
        made a purchase, it was more accurate to just call it shopping at this point—but<p></p>
        Amane had temporarily split off from Mahiru and was on his own.<p></p>
        That was because Mahiru had gone to buy something she wanted to check out on her<p></p>
        own and said she needed to be alone for a bit. This outing had been Mahiru's suggestion<p></p>
        to begin with, and Amane figured that girls had all sorts of shopping that they wouldn't<p></p>
        want other people to know about, so he readily parted ways and went over to a pillar<p></p>
        near the mall fountain they'd designated as a meeting place.<p></p>
        Amane was plenty used to accompanying women on marathon shopping trips thanks<p></p>
        to his mother, and he was also accustomed to waiting for them when they dragged him<p></p>
        around places. At the end of the day, he didn't dislike waiting quietly by himself, so he<p></p>
        did just that, without the slightest shred of irritation.<p></p>
        The staring decreased after he split off from Mahiru, which made him a little more<p></p>
        comfortable, and this intermission was just what he needed to give his overburdened<p></p>
        heart a brief rest.<p></p>
        …She's so adorable and keeps touching me. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on…<p></p>
        Mahiru was showing a side of herself she usually held back. She was joyful and<p></p>
        genuine and unspeakably charming.<p></p>
        Mahiru must have been perfectly aware of just how extraordinary her appearance<p></p>
        was, but she also seemed indifferent to her own beauty. Maybe it was because Amane<p></p>
        treated her as a friend and didn't make a big deal about it, but she didn't make a fuss<p></p>
        about her looks in front of him, and she let him see her natural cuteness, smell her<p></p>
        sweetness, feel her softness, and so much more. Amane knew he was extremely lucky<p></p>
        to be able to enjoy her company like that, but he felt too guilty to really appreciate it.<p></p>
        He was racked with shame just remembering it all, but he couldn't let it show in public,<p></p>
        so he drew his lips in tight and quietly closed his eyes.<p></p>
        All these thoughts were making him restless, so he shook his head slowly to drive them<p></p>
        from his mind.<p></p>
        Suddenly, Amane heard a high-pitched voice from close by. "Um, excuse me."<p></p>
        His eyes snapped open at the sound of an unfamiliar voice, and he looked forward to<p></p>
        see two girls smiling at him. They were probably about college age. At least, they<p></p>
        looked older than him. They were dressed stylishly for a Golden Week outing and<p></p>
        smiling at Amane, who had his eyes narrowed suspiciously.<p></p>
        "Excuse me, are you alone? Do you have some free time?"<p></p>
        He was astonished to hear the girls ask him that.<p></p>
        He would have thought that, with his head hung low, it would have been obvious he<p></p>
        didn't want to talk to anybody, so it shocked him that these girls were so bold. It was<p></p>
        unfortunate that they seemed to have no eye for quality. 5<p></p>
        Even as suspicions flickered through Amane's mind about why these girls would have<p></p>
        gone out of their way to come talk to him, when he wasn't even that nicely put together,<p></p>
        he knew it would be rude to ignore them entirely, so he went ahead and looked at them<p></p>
        with a bland expression.<p></p>
        "No, I'm waiting for someone."<p></p>
        He was hoping they would infer the situation from all the women-oriented brands<p></p>
        emblazoned on the many shopping bags Mahiru had left with him, but the girls didn't<p></p>
        seem to notice. Perhaps the bags didn't stand out because of their simple designs.<p></p>
        "I appreciate the invitation, but I've got a previous engagement, so—"<p></p>
        "In that case, your friend can come with us, too! We'll get tea or something."<p></p>
        They seemed to have decided that the friend he was waiting for was another guy.<p></p>
        If he and Mahiru had been dating, he could tell them he was waiting for his girlfriend<p></p>
        and easily turn them away with that one word, but he and Mahiru weren't actually<p></p>
        dating, and she wasn't here with him at the moment, so if he claimed she was his<p></p>
        girlfriend, he didn't know whether she would quickly back him up when she actually<p></p>
        did reappear.<p></p>
        Besides, he had once used that excuse to get her away from a drunk guy, and Mahiru<p></p>
        had told him to stop saying it, so he hesitated to use it again on his own.<p></p>
        He frowned slightly as he regarded the two girls, figuring he was probably stuck<p></p>
        talking to them until he reunited with Mahiru—then, out of the corner of his eye, he<p></p>
        spied some familiar flaxen hair.<p></p>
        "Sorry for making you wait."<p></p>
        Several seconds later, swinging her hair gently to the side and approaching with easy<p></p>
        movements, his savior, the angel, appeared.<p></p>
        She seemed to have seen that Amane was in trouble and had come quickly. Her<p></p>
        breathing was a little too fast for having just walked.<p></p>
        Mahiru smiled lightly at Amane, who had been trying to weather the waves of the girls'<p></p>
        chatter with a stoic face, and practically leaped into his arms.<p></p>
        By some stroke of luck, he managed to not let it show on his face, but Amane was<p></p>
        startled beyond belief. Mahiru was looking up at him with her body angled just right<p></p>
        so he couldn't see the girls behind her. He could sense amazement and dissatisfaction<p></p>
        in her eyes and the unspoken question of "What are you doing?" all of which he<p></p>
        recognized as a performance to help Amane extract himself from the situation.<p></p>
        …She's making me super nervous; I wish she'd stop.<p></p>
        This was all Amane's fault—he didn't want to hurt their feelings, but his indecision<p></p>
        had been mistaken for an invitation to keep chatting him up. And Mahiru had arrived<p></p>
        to rescue him, so he definitely couldn't complain about her methods. But he couldn't<p></p>
        deny it was still stressing him out.<p></p>
        Amane joined the charade by gently placing his hand on her back. It was a very<p></p>
        intimate move to show they had a special relationship.<p></p>
        "Don't worry about it," he said. "These nice girls were kind enough to keep me<p></p>
        company, so it didn't feel like that long."<p></p>
        "Oh really? Thank you for going to the trouble."<p></p>
        Mahiru half turned around with a beaming smile, and the girls looked at her in blank<p></p>
        amazement. The boy they had been trying to pick up was embracing a girl who seemed<p></p>
        like his girlfriend. On top of that, she was incredibly cute.<p></p>
        Mahiru must have realized why the girls were frozen in place, but her expression was<p></p>
        full of good will, as if she had no idea. Amane was awestruck by her apparent<p></p>
        magnanimity. She really did appear grateful, and her smile was the picture of innocence.<p></p>
        But the girls just stared at them, without moving an inch. Amane smiled back, trying<p></p>
        his best to act casual. "I'm sorry. Like I said before, I have a prior engagement, so…"<p></p>
        Amane was relieved he'd given them that excuse earlier. He tapped on Mahiru's back<p></p>
        impatiently, and Mahiru, who was still wearing a divine smile, entwined her arm with<p></p>
        his, seemingly in good spirits.<p></p>
        She was nestled very close to him again, and the breathless feeling in his chest returned,<p></p>
        but he knew he couldn't allow himself to get flustered now. Not after Mahiru had gone<p></p>
        to the trouble of putting on this act for him. So he feigned calm and bowed to the girls.<p></p>
        Mahiru followed his lead and bowed, too, then at her urging, they turned and walked<p></p>
        away from the girls.<p></p>
        Once they had turned a corner and checked to make sure they couldn't be seen, Amane<p></p>
        looked at Mahiru and saw her fake smile disappear.<p></p>
        "What were you doing?" she asked in a tone of voice that was suddenly flat and<p></p>
        detached as she looked up at him.<p></p>
        Without meaning to, Amane chuckled at the suddenness of her transformation. She<p></p>
        was still clinging tightly to him, but her expression looked weary and slightly<p></p>
