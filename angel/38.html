                <p></p>he could not fathom, but Amane felt as if he could run his heart out as long
                <p></p>as Mahiru's cooking would be waiting for him afterward.
                <p></p>"…It's worth making if it will make you happy. Then again, you are the
                <p></p>type to tell me that everything is delicious, Amane."
                <p></p>"I say everything's delicious because it is. Everything you cook is great,
                <p></p>Mahiru."
                <p></p>"…Thank you very much."
                <p></p>"I enjoy eating every bite of food you make. You're always helping me
                <p></p>out, so thank you."
                <p></p>He thought he was telling her his honest feelings, so he was slightly
                <p></p>shocked when she blatantly avoided looking at him.
                <p></p>After fidgeting uncomfortably, Mahiru let out a quiet sigh. She seemed
                <p></p>tired somehow.
                <p></p>"You won't get anything by flattering me."
                <p></p>"I bet I'll get a delicious dinner."
                <p></p>"…That's one of the things I really like about you, you know."
                <p></p>"What is?"
                <p></p>"Everything."
                <p></p>Finally, Mahiru turned away. Amane was worried that he had said
                <p></p>something that hurt her feelings. Maybe because she could tell he was
                <p></p>flustered, Mahiru did not make eye contact with Amane for some time.
