        Amane was aware that he sounded pathetic, but he couldn't bring himself to lie.<p></p>
        Anyway, if he had tried to pass himself off as someone who spent a lot of time with<p></p>
        girls, Mahiru probably would have laughed at him.<p></p>
        "Well, you seem pretty good at handling girls, all things considered," she remarked.<p></p>
        "You must be joking," Amane scoffed. "I can't handle anything. I'm just… I always try to<p></p>
        do what's right, and be decent, like my parents always said. And if I do anything bad, I<p></p>
        try to balance it out by doing something to make you happy, that's all. I'm happy when<p></p>
        you're happy… surely there's nothing wrong with that?"<p></p>
        "Nothing at all." Mahiru nodded. "You're sly that way, Amane."<p></p>
        "What's that supposed to mean?"<p></p>
        "Everything about you is sly."<p></p>
        "Are you trying to put me down…?"<p></p>
        "No, it's the opposite. I'm trying my best to encourage you, to get you to have more<p></p>
        self-confidence."<p></p>
        "…I don't understand what you're getting at, though."<p></p>
        "That's fine, you don't have to understand right now." 1<p></p>
        This wasn't the first time they'd had this exchange, and Amane still didn't know what<p></p>
        about him was supposed to be devious.<p></p>
        But Amane didn't think he needed to try too hard to find the answer.<p></p>
        Mahiru had been so concerned and dejected by Amane's behavior. Now, though, she<p></p>
        was smiling cheerfully without the least bit of worry.<p></p>
        "Anyway, I got to hear something good today," she said.<p></p>
        "Something good?"<p></p>
        "You said that I'm the first person of the opposite sex you've ever been this close with."<p></p>
        Amane responded to Mahiru's outrageous statement with a sudden coughing fit.<p></p>
        Mahiru looked up at him curiously. It didn't seem like she had intended to provoke a<p></p>
        reaction from him. She had probably just said what was on her mind. That was what<p></p>
        made it so shocking for Amane.<p></p>
        "Th-that's misleading… Well, it's not misleading, but you make it sound weird! And it's<p></p>
        none of your business anyway!" he stammered.<p></p>
        "Why are you getting so flustered? It's kind of nice, isn't it? Since I'm having all these<p></p>
        firsts, too. It means that we've both fumbled our way closer together, right?"<p></p>
        "…Well, that's true, but…"<p></p>
        Thinking about how things had been up to this point, her observation did seem<p></p>
        reasonable, but it felt overwhelmingly embarrassing to hear her say it so purely,<p></p>
        without any other intentions. The more he tried not to overthink it, the more it<p></p>
        weighed on him.<p></p>
        "…Amane?"<p></p>
        "It's nothing, so don't look at me, please."<p></p>
        He didn't want her to see the shame that was practically oozing off of him again, and<p></p>
        he turned his back to her without rising from the sofa.<p></p>
        He didn't want to be seen, and he didn't want to look at her, either.<p></p>
        "Why are you speaking so stiffly?"<p></p>
        "Don't worry about it."<p></p>
        "…All right, I won't look."<p></p>
        Instead, Mahiru turned and sat with her back to his, so that she was able to lean<p></p>
        against him. He turned his head to look at her and got a jab in the ribs.<p></p>
        He couldn't see her face, but he was certain she was grinning mischievously.<p></p>
        "If we sit like this, I'm 'not looking,' right?"<p></p>
        "…I guess not."<p></p>
        "Well, you'll just have to deal with it, since I had to deal with you avoiding me all day."<p></p>
        When she put it that way, Amane could tell that there was no way he was going to pull<p></p>
        himself out of the hole he'd dug, and he wasn't even going to bother trying.<p></p>
        Feeling a strange sort of tranquility, though the warmth gradually spreading through<p></p>
        his back was making his chest throb, Amane let his chin rest on his knees.<p></p>
        "…Please don't tell people about your first time or whatever anymore," he mumbled. "I<p></p>
        really don't know how to endure it."<p></p>
        He felt Mahiru shiver, as if she had only just then remembered the issue. Then,<p></p>
        apparently, she turned around, because he felt her grab the back of his shirt.<p></p>
        "Th-that's not what I meant to say at all, okay?! Well, it is, but I didn't say it with that<p></p>
        in mind!"<p></p>
        "I—I understand, so just don't say any more."<p></p>
        Knowing that Mahiru had never been so close to anyone made it even more<p></p>
        embarrassing when she talked about things like that.<p></p>
        It didn't take much thought to realize that the two of them had experienced a lot of<p></p>
        firsts together.<p></p>
        At least in Amane's case, Mahiru was the first girl he had held hands with, except for<p></p>
        his mother when he was a young child. Mahiru was also the only one he had ever<p></p>
        embraced. It was very likely the same for her.<p></p>
        To get to be part of these new experiences with the girl he liked, to be the first step for<p></p>
        her, was delightful, embarrassing, and an honor.<p></p>
        Amane found himself wishing that he could be her first and last love as well.<p></p>
        He smiled quietly to himself as Mahiru put her forehead against his back and rubbed<p></p>
        against him out of embarrassment. How nice it would be to stay by her side in the<p></p>
        future, he thought.<p></p>
        Chapter 43: Studying with the Angel<p></p>
        Things between Amane and Mahiru seemed to be back to normal the following day,<p></p>
        and Chitose and Itsuki appeared relieved—apparently, they had been quite concerned.<p></p>
        Amane's behavior had only changed slightly, but it must have been enough for them<p></p>
        to notice.<p></p>
        The events of the previous day weighed heavily on Amane's mind, but he wasn't acting<p></p>
        as awkwardly with Mahiru anymore. There were still some things that were bothering<p></p>
        him, but as long as they were in school, he couldn't say a word about them.<p></p>
        Mahiru was giving everyone her usual angelic smile. She was currently surrounded by<p></p>
        female classmates pestering her to teach them how to study.<p></p>
        Midterms were starting next week, and the girls must have wanted Mahiru, the top<p></p>
        genius in the grade, to be their tutor. There was a touch of bewilderment mixed into<p></p>
        Mahiru's gentle smile.<p></p>
        "I don't mind helping you all prepare for the tests, but I might not have enough room<p></p>
        to host everyone…"<p></p>
        Thinking this wasn't going to be good, Amane pricked up his ears to listen in. It seemed<p></p>
        that the girls who wanted to study with Mahiru hoped they could do it at her place.<p></p>
        They were probably curious to see what her apartment was like.<p></p>
        That would be a problem, since Mahiru is such a private person.<p></p>
        Although they weren't strangers, they weren't exactly friends, either, not like Chitose<p></p>
        was. It would be very difficult for Mahiru to let them into her home.<p></p>
        From Amane's perspective, too, he didn't want them coming around where he lived if<p></p>
        it could be avoided, just in case they caught wind of anything. He could just imagine<p></p>
        the girls prying into every detail, while he endured resentment from the boys.<p></p>
        "Ah, no fair, no fair! I want help, too!"<p></p>
        "Me toooo!"<p></p>
        Then, other girls who had overheard the conversation put their hands up as well, and<p></p>
        Mahiru was understandably wearing a troubled expression. Clearly there was no way<p></p>
        so many people could fit in her apartment.<p></p>
        To make matters worse, the boys were looking over enviously.<p></p>
        "…Um, we could study together for an hour or two in the classroom after school today,"<p></p>
        Mahiru suggested, as a compromise. Their classroom had plenty of space. Despite that,<p></p>
        there didn't seem to be an end to the chorus of voices asking to join. Club activities<p></p>
        were paused during exams, so it was probably much easier for people to gather than<p></p>
        usual.<p></p>
        As he listened to the loud shouts of his classmates from across the room, Amane<p></p>
        couldn't help but feel bad for Mahiru.<p></p>
        With a strangely cheerful grin, Itsuki prodded Amane. "You're not going to take part?"<p></p>
        "Would there be any point?" he replied. "I already know everything that's going to be<p></p>
        on the tests, and even if I didn't, with so many people, there won't be much time for<p></p>
        everyone's questions anyway. Trust me, I'm better off studying on my own."<p></p>
        "Well, I certainly must commend your discipline, Amane, but I think we'd better join<p></p>
        this study session anyway. It's a matter of motivation."<p></p>
        "I've always liked studying, so my motivation has always been—"<p></p>
        "Not yours, hers."<p></p>
        Amane looked over at Mahiru, making plans for a study session with more than half<p></p>
        the class. It was obvious that she was going to have a hard time with so many people.<p></p>
        She would probably feel better with a friend in the room. Finally, it began to dawn on<p></p>
        Amane that he ought to attend, whether or not he felt the need to.<p></p>
        "…Even though there's not really anything for her to teach me?" he asked.<p></p>
        "It'll be fine," Itsuki insisted. "Look, you can tutor me. See, Chitose is going to join in,<p></p>
        so I was gonna be stuck waiting for her anyway. There's no harm in studying a little<p></p>
        while I'm there, eh?"<p></p>
        "Teaching other people is not my strong point…"<p></p>
        "Well, sure, the way you talk is can be a bit unfriendly, and you're not exactly the type<p></p>
        to patiently explain things… but you wouldn't just let me fail, right?"<p></p>
        Amane faltered in the face of Itsuki's confident voice and gaze.<p></p>
        "I'm countin' on you, pal!" Itsuki cackled and clapped Amane on the shoulder.<p></p>
        Amane gave up on turning him down and just nodded.<p></p>
        Usually, after class ended, a handful of students might hang around for a while. But<p></p>
        that day, there was a bustle of activity that was truly rare to see.<p></p>
        The desks, which had been neatly arranged during cleaning time, were now pushed<p></p>
        together to form several clusters, and students assembled themselves with their<p></p>
        groups of friends. Even the boys from class joined, which meant there were six times<p></p>
        as many people as there should have been.<p></p>
        Amane sat facing Itsuki in the seat farthest away from Mahiru.<p></p>
        "…I can't be very much help like this, can I?" he whispered.<p></p>
        "I'm ready to learn, teacher!" Itsuki replied.<p></p>
        "…Wouldn't we be better off at home?"<p></p>
        "I'm just here to study while I wait for Chi. Besides, she's going to be late getting home,<p></p>
        and you wouldn't want to leave her on her own, right?"<p></p>
        Amane narrowed his eyes at Itsuki, who was giving him a pointed look, but Itsuki just<p></p>
        laughed.<p></p>
        Mahiru usually tried to get home before dark if she could, but because of the study<p></p>
        session, she was sure to be late. Mahiru was a very cautious person and even carried<p></p>
        a personal safety alarm around with her, but Itsuki was right, it probably wouldn't be<p></p>
        good to let her go back alone in the dark.<p></p>
        On the other hand, Amane couldn't possibly walk her home with all their classmates<p></p>
        watching, so he would have to keep his distance and stealthily watch over her as they<p></p>
        walked.<p></p>
        "You don't seem to see this for the opportunity it is, Amane…"<p></p>
        "What, you want me to turn into some sort of predator now? That's not me, and<p></p>
        personally, I have a problem with the idea of taking advantage of someone's<p></p>
        carelessness to make a move."<p></p>
        "That attitude of yours must be how you've gained her trust. Well, you guys will be<p></p>
        heading back to the same place, so I guess there's no point trying anything on the way<p></p>
        anyhow. It's not like you won't have plenty of chances to make your move."<p></p>
        "It's not like I would anyway! If I made her hate me, or made her cry, I'd die."<p></p>
        Mahiru left him plenty of openings, since she let him inside her defenses. Even so,<p></p>
        Amane had never considered seizing one of those chances to try anything. Rather, he<p></p>
        had always warned her about letting her guard down.<p></p>
        If he tried anything with Mahiru when she was being careless because of her trust in<p></p>
        him, their happy relationship could very well disappear. Amane didn't want to lose her<p></p>
        trust, or his dignity.<p></p>
        Itsuki knew what his friend was like. He shrugged in a slightly exasperated manner,<p></p>
        but Amane paid him no attention and opened his textbook to the material that would<p></p>
        be covered on the exams.<p></p>
        "Look, I'm all good here, so why don't you tell me where we should start? I don't have<p></p>
        trouble with anything, which means it's up to you to point out the sections you don't<p></p>
        understand if you want to get anything done." Amane drummed his fingers on the<p></p>
        pages and pressed his friend for an answer.<p></p>
        "Dodging the issue, huh?" Itsuki grinned and opened his own book.<p></p>
        Itsuki wasn't stupid or anything—in fact, he was quite capable. He had a good<p></p>
        understanding of his own abilities and was the type who could produce good results<p></p>
        with minimal effort. He just found studying a bore and goofed off a lot to annoy his<p></p>
        parents. Fundamentally, he had an earnest disposition.<p></p>
        Amane had heard that in middle school, Itsuki had been an honors student, but when<p></p>
        he'd started hanging out with Chitose, it apparently caused some trouble at home and<p></p>
        kicked off his rebellious phase.<p></p>
        "I seriously do not understand English sentences," Itsuki complained.<p></p>
        "Maybe you should start by memorizing the vocabulary… For now, you can begin with<p></p>
        the words and sentences that are sure to show up on the test. You slept through the<p></p>
        class when the teacher went over the exam material, but he did tell us what to expect."<p></p>
        Itsuki rarely skipped class, but he often fell asleep. Amane poked him in the forehead<p></p>
        and continued.<p></p>
        "For the time being, I'll make another copy of my notes for you. There's a limit to how<p></p>
        much you can cram for the long reading comprehension section. Basically, at this<p></p>
        point, it's probably impossible to learn it all. Don't worry about doing it perfectly, but<p></p>
        just try not to miss the vocabulary and multiple-choice questions. As long as you know<p></p>
        at least a little bit, on most multiple-choice questions you can narrow it down to two<p></p>
        answers, so we should work on getting you to where you can reliably pick the correct<p></p>
        one out of the two. Let's place the most emphasis on scoring attainable points. You're<p></p>
        just barely passing English, right?"<p></p>
        "Whew, you're a lifesaver, man! I'll thank you later by giving you a push in the right<p></p>
        direction."<p></p>
        "I do not need you to do that. It's none of your concern."<p></p>
        Amane wanted to progress slowly in his relationship with Mahiru, in his own way, so<p></p>
        if Itsuki pushed him too hard, he was liable to resist out of spite.<p></p>
        Itsuki met his friend's refusal with a frustrated look, but Amane wasn't inclined to<p></p>
        change his opinion.<p></p>
        Before he could worry about progressing in their relationship, Amane wanted to<p></p>
        improve himself enough that he would feel confident about being with Mahiru. To do<p></p>
        that, he needed to prioritize his studies.<p></p>
        Itsuki seemed like he was about to say something else, but Amane ignored him, and<p></p>
        once he had counted the number of pages in the notebook he was going to copy, he<p></p>
        slammed it shut. "Good grief," Amane said as he picked up his mechanical pencil.<p></p>
        Itsuki assumed a studying posture, and with quiet relief, Amane glanced over in<p></p>
        Mahiru's direction.<p></p>
        Just like always, she was smiling as she kindly explained the material to her<p></p>
        classmates. As he watched her circulate busily through the room, smiling at everyone<p></p>
        equally, Amane thought to himself that being the campus angel must be a tough role<p></p>
        to play.<p></p>
        "Why can't I get the answer here?"<p></p>
        "Use the formula."<p></p>
        "I'm using it, but I'm not getting the answer!"<p></p>
        Chitose's group was studying together while chatting happily, and their cluster of<p></p>
        desks was especially lively. However, a different group of boys seemed to be in trouble.<p></p>
        Even Mahiru wasn't able to follow up with every single person, and depending on each<p></p>
        individual's ability to comprehend the material, it could take time to teach them. On<p></p>
        top of that, Mahiru kept getting called over by the rowdiest students, so even though<p></p>
        she was trying to help those classmates who weren't incessantly demanding her<p></p>
        attention, she couldn't avoid getting pulled this way and that.<p></p>
        Amane hesitated for a moment over what to do, then stood up from his seat.<p></p>
        He walked over to the classmates who were frowning in frustration and looked over<p></p>
        their shoulders to check the part in the text and the equation that was tripping them<p></p>
        up. Then he slowly pointed to the relevant section in the textbook.<p></p>
        His classmates looked up at him, seemingly surprised by his sudden appearance, but<p></p>
        Amane turned a blind eye to their stares and walked them through the problem.<p></p>
        In this group's case, they were simply using the wrong formula to solve the question,<p></p>
        so it was easy to sort things out once Amane pointed out the issue that was giving<p></p>
        them trouble.<p></p>
        Amane felt relieved that they had accepted his help despite his abrupt intrusion. He<p></p>
        made eye contact with the boy sitting across from him, who was blinking repeatedly.<p></p>
        "I'm not Shiina, but it looks like she has her hands full. Sorry for butting in."<p></p>
        "…No, I'm grateful for the help," the boy said. "But I didn't expect you to come over and<p></p>
        say something, Fujimiya."<p></p>
        "Well, you looked like you were having trouble," Amane responded.<p></p>
        He found it almost darkly comical just how cold and unfriendly everyone always<p></p>
        assumed he was, but he knew it was true that he could be unsociable and downright<p></p>
        gloomy, so he couldn't deny it.<p></p>
        Amane was turning to leave with an awkward smile when the classmate across from<p></p>
        him asked, "So what about this one?" and showed Amane another problem he couldn't<p></p>
        work out.<p></p>
        Since he was there already, Amane demonstrated how to solve that question, too.<p></p>
        The other boys all looked at each other, then for some reason, over at Itsuki.<p></p>
        "Hey, Itsuki! Can we borrow Fujimiya?"<p></p>
        "Well, he's mine, but I guess there's no helping it." Itsuki grinned.<p></p>
        "Since when did I become yours?"<p></p>
        Amane feigned offense at Itsuki's comment. He noticed that his friend was cheerfully<p></p>
        pushing their two desks over to the boys in the study group. Amane was shocked at<p></p>
        how quickly Itsuki joined them.<p></p>
        He didn't really mind, but he wished Itsuki had asked his permission first.<p></p>
        Amane sighed and sat back down in his own seat, which had been integrated into the<p></p>
        new group. As he did, he kicked Itsuki lightly below the desks.<p></p>
        "Just so you know, I'm not that good at teaching," he stated.<p></p>
        "Well, thanks even so," one of the boys said. "Miss Angel looks busy over there."<p></p>
        "We all joined in at the last minute," another added, "so Shiina can't make it around to<p></p>
        everyone on her own."<p></p>
        They were staring longingly at the group that Mahiru was tutoring, but it wasn't<p></p>
        exactly envy in their eyes. They simply looked disappointed.<p></p>
        "We decided to come because it sounded fun, figuring we'd be lucky to receive any<p></p>
        help, so getting help from Fujimiya is fine with us."<p></p>
        "Well, ideally the angel, 'cause she's cute and I'd be happier, but…"<p></p>
        "Well, don't expect me to be cute," Amane said, smiling wryly. "So show me the part<p></p>
        you don't understand…?"<p></p>
        Amane prided himself on not having an ounce of cuteness to him. As a fellow guy,<p></p>
        though, he understood what the others were trying to say. Who wouldn't prefer to be<p></p>
        tutored by a friendly and intelligent girl like Mahiru, rather than an unsociable guy<p></p>
        like him? Anybody would have been happier with her.<p></p>
        Amane shrugged, then asked them where they needed help and explained the material<p></p>
        to them.<p></p>
        Fortunately, Amane was able to explain all the problems, and since the other students<p></p>
        had asked for his help, they tackled the material earnestly and came to understand it<p></p>
        fairly quickly.<p></p>
        Even Itsuki joined in with the other four students, asking questions and solving<p></p>
        example problems. It was hard enough for Amane to handle four additional people, so<p></p>
        things must have been even more difficult for Mahiru.<p></p>
        With that thought, Amane looked over in her direction and saw her answering<p></p>
        questions for the neighboring group.<p></p>
        However, none of the questions were related to the exam material.<p></p>
        "…Do I have a type?"<p></p>
        Mahiru pondered the question curiously as the girls who had asked looked at her with<p></p>
        keen interest.<p></p>
        The girls seemed to have changed tactics on Mahiru, who had been stubbornly<p></p>
        refusing to reveal anything about the boy she had mentioned. Now they were trying<p></p>
        to gather information indirectly on what kind of person he might be. Mahiru had never<p></p>
        stated outright whether the mystery boy was her boyfriend or someone she liked, but<p></p>
        even so, as one might expect, they all seemed to assume that she was interested in<p></p>
        him.<p></p>
        The girls hadn't asked their question very loudly, but the surrounding groups still<p></p>
        overheard it, and all the students in the classroom strained their ears for the answer,<p></p>
        even as they continued working on their own practice problems.<p></p>
        "Let me think…," Mahiru said. "In terms of absolute requirements, I suppose he would<p></p>
        have to be a kind and honest person. I don't like dishonest people at all."<p></p>
        "And what about appearance?"<p></p>
        "I think what's inside is more important, so I'm not too particular about looks," Mahiru<p></p>
        replied. "…But someone who keeps themselves tidy would be good."<p></p>
        The answer that she gave, with a tender smile and look in her eye, was more about the<p></p>
        kind of person she preferred than the kind of boy she liked, giving the impression that<p></p>
        she was evading the question.<p></p>
        The girls who had asked the question must have also felt that she was being vague,<p></p>
        and they stared at Mahiru with a hint of disappointment on their faces. Mahiru smiled<p></p>
        back at them as always, but this time, it was tinged with bitterness.<p></p>
        "When I think about what else might be important, I guess… someone whose values<p></p>
        match mine?"<p></p>
        "Values? Not hobbies and stuff?"<p></p>
        "Yes, values." Mahiru nodded. "I doubt they will ever match up perfectly, so I'm not<p></p>
        expecting that, but I think it's important that we respect each other's values, even if<p></p>
        they don't align. Someone who would never force their point of view, or try to change<p></p>
        their partner… Yes, someone who appreciates their partner's ideas would be good. It<p></p>
        would probably be best if it was someone who saw things the same way, but I like<p></p>
        people who stand by their partner and accept their beliefs, even if they can't."<p></p>
        Mahiru brought her speech to a finish with a gentle smile, and her gaze darted over to<p></p>
        Amane for just a second.<p></p>
        He reflexively averted his eyes, and Mahiru returned her focus to the group of girls<p></p>
        with no change in her expression.<p></p>
        Amane knew that the people around him would start to notice if he stared at Mahiru<p></p>
        any longer, so he lowered his gaze to the notebook in his hands. But then he heard a<p></p>
        quiet chuckle from beside him, from someone who had been watching his behavior.<p></p>
        "And that's that, ladies and gentlemen."<p></p>
        Itsuki had observed while everyone else had abruptly stopped working. The boys<p></p>
        Itsuki and Amane were studying with seemed to realize what was going on, and they<p></p>
        quickly went back to their own notebooks in an attempt to feign ignorance.<p></p>
        Amane was turning pages and applying sticky notes as if nothing had happened, as he<p></p>
        mulled over the idea of matching values.<p></p>
        Mahiru was the type of person who could never date anyone casually, and if she was<p></p>
        with someone for a long time, she would probably be thinking about settling down<p></p>
        with them. That meant it was important that whoever she chose didn't make things<p></p>
        difficult for her.<p></p>
        "The angel has a really mature way of thinking about things, huh?" one of the other<p></p>
        boys commented.<p></p>
        "Well, I think Shiina's got a point," Amane mumbled. When everyone turned to look at<p></p>
        him, he gave a strained smile. "It would be hard to spend time with somebody if their<p></p>
        values didn't align with yours, and everyone wants to have someone by their side who<p></p>
        accepts them, right? Even if you tried to get along with someone who held different<p></p>
        values, eventually it would put too much stress on the relationship, and you'd break<p></p>
        up. I think that logically, taking that into account from the start is better."<p></p>
        Things would be even worse if your partner was the kind of person who couldn't tolerate<p></p>
        differing opinions. The resulting stress would obviously hurt the relationship. So when it<p></p>
        comes to dating someone with incompatible beliefs, it'd be best not to even bother.<p></p>
        "You've got a strict way of thinking about it… I can't even imagine what your type is,<p></p>
        Fujimiya."<p></p>
        Amane shrugged. "Well, like everyone else, I'd prefer someone kind."<p></p>
        "That's such a vague answer! There's no other criteria?"<p></p>
        "I don't know what to say," he replied. "…Assuming that I get along with her, I think I'd<p></p>
        like a girl who's gentle and sensible."<p></p>
        "By that standard, you would like most girls."<p></p>
        "Oh, shut up. Do you have some sort of problem with that?"<p></p>
        "It's not that I have a problem, but it just feels like a very common opinion."<p></p>
        "…All right, how about I say that whatever girl I fall for will be my preferred type?<p></p>
        Whoever I like is my type at that moment."<p></p>
        Amane was afraid that if he gave too many specifics, he would end up revealing who<p></p>
        he liked, so he kept his answers as vague as possible to arousing any suspicion. From<p></p>
        behind him, he heard someone let out a small giggle.<p></p>
        "What an unexpectedly sweet thing for you to say."<p></p>
        His body stiffened at the sound of a familiar voice.<p></p>
        Amane wanted to ask her why she was over here and what exactly she had heard, but<p></p>
        Mahiru coming over to his group wasn't particularly strange, nor was it weird that she<p></p>
        would overhear what he said once she got close, so he swallowed his protests.<p></p>
        Keeping a stony expression so as not to betray his feelings, Amane didn't even look in<p></p>
        Mahiru's direction as he responded, "Sorry."<p></p>
        Amane knew that it didn't give a very good impression to be so blunt with the class<p></p>
        angel, but since he already had a reputation for being unsociable, nobody acted<p></p>
        especially surprised.<p></p>
        "Shiina…"<p></p>
        "I'm sorry for showing up so late. I haven't been able to come over here much, but…<p></p>
        are there any parts that you're having trouble understanding?"<p></p>
        Mahiru had finally finished up on the other side of the room and made her way over<p></p>
        to check on Amane's group. She sounded quite apologetic. Amane didn't know<p></p>
        whether she was standing next to him on purpose or not, but it wasn't good for his<p></p>
        heart.<p></p>
        After the boys all looked at each other, one of them spoke up, looking sheepish.<p></p>
        "Uh, actually, we got Fujimiya to tutor us. We should be the ones apologizing, for<p></p>
        joining your study session so suddenly."<p></p>
        "Oh, no, it's all right. It's my fault, really, for agreeing to tutor so many people without<p></p>
        thinking about how much I can handle. I just couldn't keep up with everyone. But I'm<p></p>
        relieved to hear that you got help from Fujimiya." She gave him a friendly smile and<p></p>
        added, "Studying is one of Fujimiya's strong points."<p></p>
        Amane felt extremely uncomfortable, but he didn't show his discomfort. "I am honored<p></p>
        by the compliment," he replied stoically.<p></p>
        Immediately after he said it, he looked up apologetically at Mahiru, worried that his<p></p>
        comment might have sounded sarcastic, but Mahiru met his eyes with a smile and an<p></p>
        affectionate look, as if to say that she understood everything.<p></p>
        "Fujimiya is very helpful and good at teaching, you know," Mahiru insisted.<p></p>
        "I… uh… I wouldn't really say that…," Amane stammered.<p></p>
        "Oh, and what would you call this? Plus, it's easy to see the way you support Chitose<p></p>
        and Akazawa, too. You act cold, but you're always watching out for them, right? You<p></p>
        extend your hand as soon as you see someone's in trouble."<p></p>
        Amane scowled when she said that it was "easy to see" him doing that, with such a<p></p>
        gentle expression on her face.<p></p>
        Mahiru did sometimes compliment Amane, but he never expected her to say<p></p>
        something like that or praise him in a place like this. His eyes began to dart nervously<p></p>
        around the room.<p></p>
        "He's blushing, he's blushing!" Itsuki jeered.<p></p>
        "Shut up, Itsuki… It's totally normal to support your friends."<p></p>
        Mahiru smiled fondly at him. "I'm glad that it's become a normal thing for you."<p></p>
        Finally, Amane couldn't endure it any longer, and he turned away.<p></p>
        Under the desk, Itsuki kicked him lightly with the toe of his shoe, as if urging Amane<p></p>
        on toward something.<p></p>
        As the study session concluded, Amane rolled his shoulders gently to loosen up the<p></p>
        stiffness that had gradually accumulated there.<p></p>
        Mahiru was looking at him with her usual smile and a hint of deep affection—it was a<p></p>
        look only someone close to her would recognize. Itsuki had noticed and started<p></p>
        pestering Amane secretly under the desk again. The boys in their study group had also<p></p>
        gotten used to Amane's presence and chatted openly with him as well.<p></p>
        For better or worse, Amane was exhausted. It was a good thing to have made some<p></p>
        friendly acquaintances, but it was somewhat difficult to do anything at all with Mahiru<p></p>
        there.<p></p>
        The other boys were finished studying too and returned the copies of Amane's notes<p></p>
        with promises of candy and junk food to repay him for the help.<p></p>
        Some of their classmates had left partway through, either because they had other<p></p>
        things to do or because it was a more serious study session than they wanted, so<p></p>
        Amane was secretly admiring the ones who had stayed for their diligence.<p></p>
        "Sorry for making you wait. And after you helped me out, too."<p></p>
        Mahiru stayed to the very end, to clean and tidy the classroom and return the key to<p></p>
        the office. Other classmates had asked if she wanted to head home together, but as the<p></p>
        organizer, she had various tasks to finish up, so she'd given them each a firm refusal<p></p>
        and had been about to stay behind alone until Amane had stepped in. He told her that<p></p>
        they had all used the classroom together, and it would surely be dangerous to let<p></p>
        Mahiru head home on her own late at night, so he would stay with her.<p></p>
        He wished that Itsuki and Chitose had been there to stay behind as well, though. He<p></p>
        felt some minor frustration toward his friends, who had thoughtlessly ducked out<p></p>
        earlier, as he and Mahiru walked down the deserted hallways together.<p></p>
        Since club activities were temporarily on hold, and since the sun had already set, there<p></p>
        were probably only a few teachers, office staff, and students left in the building. It<p></p>
        wasn't good to be seen alone with Mahiru at school, but it was too late to change that.<p></p>
        "No, no, I'm the one who should be apologizing," Amane insisted. "I might have gotten<p></p>
        in your way instead."<p></p>
        "Not at all; you really helped me out," Mahiru replied. "There was no way I could go<p></p>
        around to everyone by myself. I never imagined so many people would show up… and<p></p>
        there were some people who joined at the last minute, so there were way more than I<p></p>
        expected."<p></p>
        "I feel like that's not a big surprise, for the angel."<p></p>
        "…Oh, come on."<p></p>
        She shot him a look as a reminder that she didn't want him to call her by that<p></p>
        nickname, which Amane let pass with feigned ignorance. It was his meager payback<p></p>
        for her publicly complimenting him.<p></p>
        "But it went well; everyone tackled the material seriously," she said.<p></p>
        "There was a lot of chitchat throughout the room, but everyone was more serious than<p></p>
        I expected. Even I was working hard to keep up."<p></p>
        "You always take your studies seriously, Fujimiya. You seem even more motivated for<p></p>
        this round of exams than you have before."<p></p>
        "…I guess. I've been thinking I should put some more effort into certain things."<p></p>
        Amane intended to do the best he could at studying and at exercise. At the moment,<p></p>
        there was hardly anyone around, and he had a good reason to be accompanying<p></p>
        Mahiru, so he stayed by her side. However, Amane wanted to become someone who<p></p>
        could be with her without needing a reason and not worry about people talking.<p></p>
        Mahiru, who he was sure had no idea of the deeper reasons behind Amane's efforts,<p></p>
        smiled at him and said, "How admirable." They had just arrived at the entry hall, and<p></p>
        she turned to look at their surroundings. "The sun's already gone down, hasn't it?"<p></p>
        "Sure has," Amane agreed.<p></p>
        He noticed her staring at him.<p></p>
        She wasn't wearing her usual angelic smile, but rather the more intimate and slightly<p></p>
        expectant one that she often showed him when they were alone together.<p></p>
        Amane hesitated, briefly unsure of what she wanted. Though from their previous<p></p>
        conversations, he managed to guess what she was thinking and put on a slight smile.<p></p>
        "…It's late, so I'll walk you home."<p></p>
        Evidently, he guessed correctly, because Mahiru's porcelain cheeks flushed slightly,<p></p>
        turning the color of roses, and her lips gently curled up.<p></p>
        "Thank you for being so thoughtful," she said. "It's very kind of you."<p></p>
        "Are you making fun of me? You basically just told me what to do…," he muttered<p></p>
        quietly.<p></p>
        "Heh-heh."<p></p>
        Apparently Mahiru had heard what he said, and she crinkled her eyes like she found<p></p>
        it funny. "You dummy," she teased, before changing her shoes and heading out the front<p></p>
        door. Since they were supposed to be walking together, Amane slowed down to match<p></p>
        Mahiru's pace and let out a deliberate sigh.<p></p>
        …I bet it's pretty obvious.<p></p>
        It was clear that he had stayed behind so late in order to wait for Mahiru so that she<p></p>
        wouldn't have to go home alone.<p></p>
        Only, it wasn't good for them to be alone together in public, so he had intended to walk<p></p>
        behind or ahead of her, not side by side. Except now that she had anticipated it and<p></p>
        manipulated him into escorting her, there was no way he could say no to her.<p></p>
        "…You're a girl, Miss Shiina, so you shouldn't go home too late, you know."<p></p>
        "How kind of you to say so. Usually, I get home safely, and today I have you with me,<p></p>
        Mr. Fujimiya, so I feel extra safe."<p></p>
        "…Indeed."<p></p>
        Illuminated by the dim, unreliable streetlights, Mahiru's smile looked brighter than<p></p>
        the bulbs themselves, and Amane averted his eyes to avoid being dazzled.<p></p>
        Chapter 44: Studying with Everyone<p></p>
        "Good morning, Fujimiya!"<p></p>
        "Morning."<p></p>
        The boys who had been in Amane's study group the day before greeted him breezily<p></p>
        the following morning. Incidentally, Mahiru had been in high spirits the whole walk<p></p>
        home and the rest of the night after they got back to their apartments.<p></p>
        Amane returned his classmates' morning greetings with a slight wave and set his bag<p></p>
        down at his desk. Itsuki and Yuuta, who had both arrived before Amane, ambled over,<p></p>
        smiling. Itsuki seemed to have a touch of Chitose's wicked scheming about him, and<p></p>
        Amane didn't think it was his imagination.<p></p>
        Predictably, Itsuki's grin changed to a smug smirk. Amane almost clicked his tongue<p></p>
        in irritation.<p></p>
        "How'd yesterday go?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
        "Nothing really to report. And definitely nothing to warrant that dumb grin."<p></p>
        "Oh right, you guys had that study session, didn't you?" Yuuta said. "I had something<p></p>
        else to do, so I couldn't make it. Did anything happen?"<p></p>
        Yuuta hadn't been there, so he didn't seem to know the reason behind Itsuki's smug<p></p>
        expression.<p></p>
        Amane didn't feel like going to the trouble of explaining, so he shrugged and made a<p></p>
        face at Itsuki that conveyed mostly annoyance and frustration. "No, not really. We just<p></p>
        had a normal, solid study session."<p></p>
        "Oh, come on…," Itsuki prodded. "Nothing to say about my brilliant setup?"<p></p>
        "It was none of your business anyway, that's for sure."<p></p>
        Amane had been planning to escort Mahiru home (really, since their destinations were<p></p>
        basically the same, it would be more accurate to say he was also going home)<p></p>
        regardless of whether Itsuki had left first or not. Amane probably wouldn't have felt<p></p>
        so awkward or been so worried about attracting attention, and it would have<p></p>
        obviously been more comfortable if Itsuki and Chitose had tagged along.<p></p>
        "I'm fine," Amane insisted. "I'm making steady progress at my own pace, and I don't<p></p>
        need any encouragement."<p></p>
        "I'm pushing you because I'm starting to get impatient, though…," Itsuki whined.<p></p>
        "Shut up. Or I won't let you copy my notes."<p></p>
        "Ah! This is where I must withdraw. I shall spare you this time." 2<p></p>
        "You're infuriating."<p></p>
        Itsuki was the one in trouble, now that exams were drawing near and there was no<p></p>
        more time left. Itsuki would probably do fine even without much studying, but he had<p></p>
        said himself that it would be impossible for him to pass any of his weak subjects<p></p>
        without at least some preparation.<p></p>
        When Amane took the copy of notes out of his file folder and handed them over, he<p></p>
        teased, "Victory is mine," but was doubtful whether Itsuki would study hard once he<p></p>
        got home.<p></p>
        Amane went to give copies of his notes to the boys who had greeted him earlier—they<p></p>
        had requested them the day before. As thanks, they gave him candy until his hands<p></p>
        were full.<p></p>
        "You're a very caring dude," Itsuki remarked as Amane returned to his desk carrying<p></p>
        heaps of snacks. Itsuki seemed like he was about to launch into a story about Mahiru's<p></p>
        praise for Amane the day before.<p></p>
        Amane could feel his face begin to twitch as he cut Itsuki off—"You didn't offer me<p></p>
        anything, so I just made your copy along with the others."<p></p>
        Yuuta had been watching with a smile as always, but suddenly he made a disappointed<p></p>
        face. "I should have participated yesterday. It sounds like it was pretty fun. I wanted to<p></p>
        study with everyone, too."<p></p>
        "Well, Itsuki had fun messing with me," Amane said, "but I didn't have any fun being<p></p>
        messed with."<p></p>
        "This again?"<p></p>
        "Now, now. Itsuki's teasing comes from a place of love," Yuuta jested. "Probably. I<p></p>
        think."<p></p>
        "Why must you all doubt me so?"<p></p>
        "He gets sullen sometimes when you tease him too much, and it makes me wonder<p></p>
        whether there's love behind the jokes or not. You've got to dial it back at times, you<p></p>
        know? Fujimiya will probably forgive you eventually, but you'd better figure out where<p></p>
        the line is before you cross it."<p></p>
        "Yeah, sure, no problem. I know exactly where the line is."<p></p>
        "This guy pisses me off," Amane muttered.<p></p>
        Itsuki had never teased Amane to the point of crossing any lines or making him truly<p></p>
        angry. Even if Amane pouted a little bit, he was never really offended, and Itsuki always<p></p>
        stopped when Amane clapped back in irritation, and he never complained when he<p></p>
        got a particularly pointed retort, either. He probably knew where the line was.<p></p>
        Itsuki's knack at dancing around that line was impressive and a singular point of<p></p>
        irritation in Amane's life.<p></p>
        "Well now, I suppose Itsuki has always been a little… irritating," Yuuta admitted.<p></p>
        "How can you be so casually cruel, Yuuta? Who knew you were such a harsh critic?"<p></p>
        "I've recently decided that I can stand to be a bit harsh with you sometimes."<p></p>
        "You monster! I protest!"<p></p>
        "Ah-ha-ha!"<p></p>
        Yuuta laughed it off as Itsuki faked a pose of indignation; it was obvious that he wasn't<p></p>
        actually upset. Amane felt satisfied to see Itsuki on the receiving end of the jokes for<p></p>
        once, on several levels.<p></p>
        Amane couldn't hate him, even at times like this, so he secretly had on a wry smile.<p></p>
        "So let's just set Itsuki aside for a moment…," Yuuta said.<p></p>
        "Don't leave me out!" he protested.<p></p>
        "We won't get anywhere with you jabbering on, Itsuki, so be quiet for a minute. Now,<p></p>
        Amane, I'd also like to study together, the three of us. Want to have a study session on<p></p>
        Saturday or Sunday?"<p></p>
        Itsuki obediently shut his mouth tight like a certain cartoon rabbit, and Yuuta turned<p></p>
        away from him to ask Amane again, "How about it?"<p></p>
        Amane didn't have anything in particular planned for the weekend, and he figured that<p></p>
        with Yuuta there, it would probably be a normal study session, so he was inclined to<p></p>
        agree, but then he hesitated.<p></p>
        Amane thought a study session sounded fine, but there was the question of where to<p></p>
        hold it.<p></p>
        "…So where would we do it?"<p></p>
        "Ah, my place is out," Itsuki responded. "My parents will be there, so I think it'll be<p></p>
        awkward, or there might be an unpleasant atmosphere." Itsuki's tone was casual, but<p></p>
        Amane could tell that his friend was upset about the poor relationship he had with his<p></p>
        parents.<p></p>
        "…My house would be fine, I guess, but my older sisters will probably get in our way a<p></p>
        little, so I don't think it's well-suited for studying," Yuuta said.<p></p>
        "You've got sisters?"<p></p>
        "Yeah, two of them. They're kind of loud, pushy people, so I think Fujimiya would<p></p>
        probably be uncomfortable."<p></p>
        Amane knew that Yuuta was probably not downplaying it or anything, that his sisters<p></p>
        really were those kinds of girls. If he had to guess, Amane got the feeling that they<p></p>
        were the type he couldn't handle, so he thought it best to avoid Yuuta's house if<p></p>
        possible.<p></p>
        That meant Amane's place would be the most convenient.<p></p>
        Itsuki had been to his apartment many times before, and Amane didn't have any<p></p>
        objections to the idea of Yuuta coming in. At the same time, Amane wasn't the only<p></p>
        person who spent time in that apartment.<p></p>
        Mahiru wasn't necessarily always in his apartment, but she was kind enough to come<p></p>
        over and cook, and they had been studying together a lot recently, so there was a high<p></p>
        probability that she would be there over the weekend.<p></p>
        Amane smiled vaguely, thinking that he'd better not bring guests over without getting<p></p>
        Mahiru's permission first.<p></p>
        "Do you think you could ask her about it?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
        "Ah, sure, I can do that." Amane nodded. "We can't just barge in without warning."<p></p>
        "It is your little love nest, after all…"<p></p>
        "Seriously, shut your mouth."<p></p>
        Amane glared at Itsuki, wondering what he would do if they were overheard, but<p></p>
        Itsuki had kept his voice low enough, and none of their classmates seemed to be<p></p>
        looking their way.<p></p>
        Amane gave an exasperated sigh and cast his eyes downward, thinking of Mahiru, who<p></p>
        was not currently in the classroom.<p></p>
        "Hey, Mahiru? I'm going to have a study session at my place with Itsuki and Kadowaki<p></p>
        tomorrow morning. Is that all right?"<p></p>
        After dinner, as he was carrying the dishes over to the sink, Amane posed the question<p></p>
        to Mahiru, who was carrying the silverware.<p></p>
        Itsuki had said that Saturday was better for his schedule. Amane felt bad about asking<p></p>
        at the last minute.<p></p>
        Mahiru blinked dramatically once, then gave him an encouraging look.<p></p>
        "I don't mind. Should I make food for everyone?"<p></p>
        "Oh, I would feel bad asking you to do so much, but… but I'd be grateful if you could…<p></p>
        Is that all right?"<p></p>
        "It's just a matter of making a bit more. I don't mind," she answered casually.<p></p>
        Amane was certain that it would still take a lot of extra labor. She'd probably planned<p></p>
        on making lunch for herself anyway, but nevertheless, he wouldn't be able to thank<p></p>
        Mahiru enough for adjusting her plans to match up with his.<p></p>
        "Can I study with you, too?"<p></p>
        "If you want to, the guys said it was fine… Should we call Chitose, too? I don't know<p></p>
        whether she's free or not, or whether she's really going to study, but I feel a little<p></p>
        anxious about leaving her out."<p></p>
        Chitose wasn't very studious. It wasn't that she didn't know how to study, but Amane<p></p>
        certainly wouldn't call her an academic. Though she had participated in the previous<p></p>
        day's study session, apparently, she hadn't made much progress, and she had even<p></p>
        laughed about how she was going to fail the tests. 4<p></p>
        "You don't need to worry about that. I've already invited her."<p></p>
        "Huh?"<p></p>
        "Well, she was saying that she'll get told off by her father if she doesn't get a good score,<p></p>
        for her anyway, on this round of tests, so just today, I made plans to study with her on<p></p>
        Saturday."<p></p>
        "Maybe joining us was Chitose's plan all along?"<p></p>
        Amane had a feeling that Itsuki had told Chitose about their study party, but he had no<p></p>
        definitive proof. He smiled wryly at the thought of his two meddling friends, convinced<p></p>
        that she had gotten her information through Itsuki.<p></p>
        Wishing they had just told him the plan from the start, he quickly rinsed the oily plates<p></p>
        in hot water and began washing the dishes. Mahiru giggled a little and started packing<p></p>
        the cooled leftovers away in Tupperware.<p></p>
        "Well, whether that was her original aim or not, it looks like it will be a very lively<p></p>
        study session, huh?" she remarked.<p></p>
        "Will that be all right for you? If it gets a bit loud?"<p></p>
        "I'll be fine," Mahiru insisted. "Besides, I've been studying every day, so I'm not that<p></p>
        anxious about the tests."<p></p>
        Mahiru didn't need to worry, because she worked hard every day, so Amane didn't<p></p>
        really think anything more of it.<p></p>
        Though he did wonder how the group was going to manage to study efficiently.<p></p>
        "Hey, Mahiru, after we're done, could I look at your notes?"<p></p>
        "Sure, I don't mind. But you take nice notes too, Amane. They're popular, I hear."<p></p>
        "My notes are, sure. I guess because they're fairly neat. But I'm curious about the notes<p></p>
        of the top-ranking student."<p></p>
        "Don't get your hopes up because they're not as good as you're expecting."<p></p>
        Mahiru giggled again and put the leftovers in the refrigerator.<p></p>
        They would become Amane's breakfast the next day, so as he did the washing up, in<p></p>
        his mind, he thanked Mahiru. He was able to eat her home cooking not only for dinner,<p></p>
        but even for breakfast, improving his daily life, knowing that he was eating healthily<p></p>
        every day.<p></p>
        "Amane, you're studying really hard for these exams, aren't you?"<p></p>
        "Well, I'd like to improve my confidence in a few areas, and I figure if I'm going to go<p></p>
        to the trouble of studying, I should really work hard at it. I'd like to score in the top<p></p>
        ten."<p></p>
        "Is that so…? All right, then how about I give you a little motivation, then?"<p></p>
        "Motivation?"<p></p>
        "If you do make it into the top ten, I'll do anything you ask." 1<p></p>
        "…Huh?"<p></p>
        Amane froze for a second and nearly dropped the plate he was holding into the sink.<p></p>
        He couldn't believe what he'd just heard. 2<p></p>
        Almost breaking one of Mahiru's favorite plates brought Amane back to his senses,<p></p>
        and he took a deep breath.<p></p>
        Then he glanced over beside him and saw Mahiru, wearing her usual placid smile,<p></p>
        snapping the lid onto one of the containers.<p></p>
        "I said before that I would do basically anything if you just asked, but I figure this time,<p></p>
        we can make it a real prize. I'll grant you any wish, even something you would never<p></p>
        normally ask, okay?"<p></p>
        "…Girls shouldn't say things like that."<p></p>
        "Oh, are you going to ask me to do something dangerous?"<p></p>
        Though she must have been entirely aware that Amane would never do any such thing,<p></p>
        Mahiru tilted her head teasingly as she asked, and Amane couldn't help but frown. She<p></p>
        seemed confident that there would be no great danger in anything that Amane might<p></p>
        request.<p></p>
        When Amane stared at Mahiru, she gave him a bemused smile and bounced over to<p></p>
        stand beside him. He couldn't tell whether it was his imagination, but a hopeful look<p></p>
        seemed to have flashed across her face.<p></p>
        "…Supposing I did ask for something dangerous, what would you do?"<p></p>
        "Well, that would depend on what it was, but I think… I would admire your chivalry<p></p>
        and probably grant your wish." 3<p></p>
        It sounded like Mahiru did mean to fulfill Amane's request. Of course, that was probably<p></p>
        because she was sure that he wouldn't force her to do anything unreasonable. Amane<p></p>
        felt somewhat conflicted.<p></p>
        He didn't want to force her to do anything she didn't want to, but hearing the girl he<p></p>
        liked tell him that she would do anything he wanted gave him all sorts of wild ideas—<p></p>
        none of which he could say out loud.<p></p>
        He took a quick look at Mahiru and saw her smiling as if to say she was ready for<p></p>
        anything. She looked so innocent. Amane felt skewered by his own wretchedness.<p></p>
        "…All right, I want you to let me lie in your lap, like you did before." 2<p></p>
        Amane just barely held it together. After some deliberation, he made up his mind and<p></p>
        asked for something that he knew Mahiru was likely to agree to, and that he would in<p></p>
        general never request.<p></p>
        He wanted to experience that pleasant feeling one more time. It didn't seem like an<p></p>
        outrageous request, and Amane figured he could keep ahold of himself.<p></p>
        The moment he said it, Amane felt miserably embarrassed at his own request. Mahiru<p></p>
        looked back at him, blinking repeatedly, and stared at Amane's face.<p></p>
        Then, with an adorable, bashful look, she answered, "Okay by me. I'll throw in an ear<p></p>
        cleaning for you, so prepare to be pampered."<p></p>
        She puffed out her chest, looking like she had no doubt Amane would make it into the<p></p>
        top ten.<p></p>
        "We're here!"<p></p>
        The Saturday before the tests, as planned, Itsuki, Chitose, and Yuuta showed up around<p></p>
        ten in the morning, called out a greeting in unison from the doorway, and shuffled over<p></p>
        the threshold.<p></p>
        Apparently, the three of them had grown up in the same neighborhood, and it had been<p></p>
        convenient for them to meet up before coming over. They met up first also because<p></p>
        Yuuta didn't know where Amane's apartment was, but the main reason was probably<p></p>
        because they were already good friends.<p></p>
        Amane welcomed them. "Great, come on in."<p></p>
        "Where's Mahiru?" Chitose asked.<p></p>
        "In the kitchen, getting lunch ready."<p></p>
        So that they didn't have to worry about their midday meal, Mahiru had come over to<p></p>
        Amane's apartment ahead of time to prepare it. She had made a trip to a supermarket<p></p>
        that opened early in the morning to buy the ingredients.<p></p>
        She was making roast beef and wanted to let it slowly cook so that by lunch, it would<p></p>
        be just the right tenderness and ready to eat.<p></p>
        "…You two are getting awfully comfortable…," Itsuki whispered.<p></p>
        "Shut up."<p></p>
        "You guys are like a newlyweds, welcoming your colleagues over for a meal."<p></p>
        "One more word, and you won't get any lunch," Amane threatened.<p></p>
        "No way! I'm eating Mahiru's cooking!"<p></p>
        Warning Itsuki to keep his mischief to a minimum, Amane looked over at Yuuta, who<p></p>
        was staring at him, slightly astonished.<p></p>
        "What's up, Yuuta?"<p></p>
        "…It's just, Shiina seems so at home here in your apartment, Fujimiya," he replied.<p></p>
        "…It'd almost be weirder if she wasn't," Amane grumbled. "…Since she's always making<p></p>
        food for me."<p></p>
        Amane turned away abruptly and saw Itsuki grinning with his hands over his mouth.<p></p>
        It reminded him of the way his mother smiled, which made him angry, and he kicked<p></p>
        Itsuki lightly in the shin.<p></p>
        "Welcome, everyone…," Mahiru said as she emerged from the kitchen. "Oh, Akazawa,<p></p>
        what happened?"<p></p>
        Amane scoffed. "Don't worry about him."<p></p>
        Mahiru looked worried about Itsuki, who seemed to be wearing a mysterious smile. It<p></p>
        wasn't anything she needed to worry about, and Amane wished she would just ignore<p></p>
        it.<p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to conclude that Itsuki's expression was nothing to be concerned<p></p>
        about, so even though she still looked curious, she put on her usual smile and returned<p></p>
        to the kitchen with a flutter of her apron. "I've got a little more preparation to do in<p></p>
        there, so please go ahead into the living room."<p></p>
        Watching her leave, Itsuki mumbled, "She is absolutely brimming with just-married<p></p>
        wife energy." This time, Amane slapped him on the back. 1<p></p>
        They waited for Mahiru to finish her work in the kitchen, and after she was done, she<p></p>
        brought out tea. "Well, should we get to studying?" she asked, taking a seat next to<p></p>
        Amane. The other three had made sure to leave that spot open.<p></p>
        "Yeah!"<p></p>
        "All right, what parts don't you understand, Chitose? We covered English yesterday<p></p>
        and were planning to work on math today, right?"<p></p>
        "Everything," Chitose replied.<p></p>
        Mahiru balked. "E-everything…?"<p></p>
        "Chi is not very good at math," Itsuki commented. "She barely avoided failing last time."<p></p>
        Chitose wasn't completely hopeless, but that was her weakest subject, and she<p></p>
        announced after every test that only divine intervention had kept her from failing.<p></p>
        The word "everything" caused Mahiru's cheek to twitch slightly, but since math was<p></p>
        Chitose's weakness, there really was no helping it. They would be lucky if she managed<p></p>
        to understand the basics.<p></p>
        "She has a hard time with applied problems, so the best thing would be to show her<p></p>
        how to use the formulas with each exercise, I think," Itsuki said.<p></p>
        "Is she all right on the formulas?" Mahiru asked Itsuki.<p></p>
        "…You're okay there, right?" Itsuki asked Chitose.<p></p>
        "Probably." Chitose nodded.<p></p>
        Amane got the feeling that Chitose was not actually okay, and that Mahiru had her<p></p>
        work cut out for her. Chitose wasn't exactly dumb; she just couldn't solve the problems<p></p>
        because she didn't know how to use the formulas. So as long as she learned how, she<p></p>
        ought to be able to get a decent score, for her anyway.<p></p>
        "You almost seem motivated now, Itsuki," Amane observed.<p></p>
        "Ha-ha-ha!"<p></p>
        "Don't try to laugh it off; get to studying."<p></p>
        Why do you think we organized this study session? Amane thought to himself.<p></p>
        "Yuuutaaa, Amane's being mean!" Itsuki whined playfully.<p></p>
        "You'd better shape up soon, then."<p></p>
        With a bright smile, Yuuta refused to rescue Itsuki, who let his shoulders droop<p></p>
        dejectedly.<p></p>
        Yuuta himself had already studiously opened his textbook and notebook to get started.<p></p>
        Amane wished that Itsuki and Chitose would follow his example.<p></p>
        Yuuta didn't seem to have any particularly weak subjects. He was an outstanding<p></p>
        student who had above-average scores across the board.<p></p>
        Amane also wasn't worried about any subject in particular—all he had left was to<p></p>
        polish up his memorization and application skills.<p></p>
        He entrusted the task of tutoring Chitose to Mahiru and lowered his gaze to the world<p></p>
        history textbook that he had set out for himself.<p></p>
        Amane and the others continued studying after lunch, but eventually, around
        <p></p>
        mid-afternoon, Chitose seemed to reach the limits of her concentration <p></p>
        and leaned back in her chair. "I'm exhausted! Hey, Amane, could we play a video game?"<p></p>
        "You're free to play if you want, but I can't make any promises about your grades…"<p></p>
        "Geez, you're so strict."<p></p>
        "It's because you never just play a little bit. If you think you can control yourself, then<p></p>
        I suppose you can go ahead," he replied while solving a workbook problem, signaling<p></p>
        that he was going to continue studying. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Chitose<p></p>
        puff out her cheeks a little.<p></p>
        Amane had predicted it was only a matter of time before Chitose got bored of studying,<p></p>
        an activity he knew she hated. That was why he had put four controllers and several<p></p>
        games beside the console in his TV stand.<p></p>
        A human's attention span can only last so long, so he figured it wouldn't be so bad for<p></p>
        his friends to play and take a breather.<p></p>
        On the other hand, Amane had no problem studying some more. Since they started, he<p></p>
        took a short break every hour, and in the first place, he didn't mind studying. He could<p></p>
        keep going for quite a long time if he wanted to.<p></p>
        "You're no fun, Amane!" Chitose huffed.<p></p>
        "This is supposed to be a study party, right? I guess it's fine if you really want to play.<p></p>
        I've got four controllers, so how about you take a short break?"<p></p>
        "Okay, I'll accept your offer, but… you shouldn't push yourself too hard, okay?"<p></p>
        "I've been taking breaks."<p></p>
        "What a dedicated student! You've always been so serious, Amane. All right, then, I'm<p></p>
        gonna game. Let's play, Itsuki."<p></p>
        "Yeah, sure. But we can't waste all of our time."<p></p>
        Amane was not surprised that Itsuki also seemed tired after the three or so hours of<p></p>
        studying and was keen to play a game.<p></p>
        "Wanna join, Yuuta?" he asked.<p></p>
        "Sure, why not? Is it all right, Fujimiya?"<p></p>
        "Mmm." Amane nodded.<p></p>
        Even Yuuta, who was more serious about his studies than Itsuki or Chitose, was<p></p>
        showing interest in taking a short break. Amane confirmed that Yuuta was free to join<p></p>
        the others, then looked back down at his workbook.<p></p>
        Beside him, Mahiru was quietly working on solving a set of problems. She was as<p></p>
        focused as before and showed no signs of stopping.<p></p>
        "You're not going to play, Mahiru?" he asked her.<p></p>
        "I'm going to study a little more," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
        "I see."<p></p>
        Amane had vowed to start taking his studies seriously, which was the only reason he<p></p>
        wasn't stopping, but Mahiru had a natural affinity for studying, and he couldn't help<p></p>
        but admire her diligence.<p></p>
        She'd probably continue ranking first place on the exams since she never failed to put<p></p>
        in the effort—that dedication was just another reason why Mahiru was so incredible.<p></p>
        After watching the other three excitedly get up from the table and start taking up<p></p>
        positions in front of the television, Amane put them out of his mind and went back to<p></p>
        work. He could hear pencil lead scratching against paper, the sound of the eraser<p></p>
        rubbing out the marks, and, very clearly, the sound of Mahiru's breathing at his side.<p></p>
        While listening half-heartedly to the animated voices of his friends nearby, Amane<p></p>
        focused on remembering which questions the teachers tended to choose for exams.<p></p>
        Several of his teachers had been teaching him since his first year of high school, and<p></p>
        he knew that those teachers' tests were relatively easy. And from their personalities<p></p>
        and the way they conducted their classes, he could guess what sections of the material<p></p>
        they would pull from, especially since he remembered their style from the previous<p></p>
        year. Amane felt pretty certain that he could predict what they would put on their<p></p>
        tests.<p></p>
        He had even told Chitose about which sections of the textbook the test questions<p></p>
        would most likely cover. It was just a calculated guess, but he had never been wrong<p></p>
        before, so if she prioritized those areas when she studied, she would probably at least<p></p>
        avoid failing.<p></p>
        "Amane, here."<p></p>
        While he was solving problems in silence, Mahiru had stood up unnoticed, and now<p></p>
        she set a cup of coffee down in front of him.<p></p>
        He smiled at the beverage, which he guessed had one small sugar cube and a single<p></p>
        portion of milk stirred in.<p></p>
        "The usual is all right, yeah?"<p></p>
        "Mm. Thank you."<p></p>
        They had been spending time together for half a year, so they had gotten to know each<p></p>
        other's tastes.<p></p>
        Feeling grateful toward Mahiru, who had brought the coffee over right when he started<p></p>
        to get a craving, Amane wrapped his fingers around the mug handle, then realized that<p></p>
        she had also placed a small plate before him.<p></p>
        "What's this?"<p></p>
        "A financier. I baked them yesterday, thinking we would need some sugar to fuel our<p></p>
        brains."<p></p>
        On the little plate sat one bite-sized financier, baked to a perfect golden brown. A<p></p>
        toothpick stuck out of the top of the small cake, so that he could pick it up without<p></p>
        getting his fingers dirty. Mahiru had probably made them bite-size so that they could<p></p>
        be enjoyed in the spare moments between studying.<p></p>
        Mahiru had also dutifully set out cakes for Itsuki and the others still playing the video<p></p>
        game. Theirs were slightly larger and served on plates that sat together on a platter.<p></p>
        Mahiru had also prepared coffee for the three of them, but the milk and sugar were<p></p>
        self-serve, with sugar packets and little pots of cream laid out on the platter.<p></p>
        With a smile, she quietly approached the gamers and set the tray down on a table<p></p>
        nearby. "You should all have some, too."<p></p>
        "Wow! Thank you, Mahiru!"<p></p>
        "Oh, snacks! Perfect timing, too. Thank you, Shiina."<p></p>
        "It's nothing, really."<p></p>
        Mahiru returned to the table, gazing happily at the trio now enjoying their snack time,<p></p>
        and Amane felt his lips curling into a smile as well.<p></p>
        "…I sort of feel like I made you prepare a lot of stuff."<p></p>
        "No, I did it because I wanted to," Mahiru insisted. "And I did everything in between<p></p>
        studying, so it was a good way to take breaks."<p></p>
        "You're the type of person who always goes all out, seriously."<p></p>
        "…I just use my time on the people I want to use it on."<p></p>
        Amane felt a hot lump rising up in his throat when she mumbled these words in a<p></p>
        quiet voice.<p></p>
        He washed it down with a swig of coffee. Mahiru hadn't added any extra sugar, but it<p></p>
        somehow seemed particularly sweet.<p></p>
        The sweetness wasn't unpleasant, and he wasn't sure how he should respond to what<p></p>
        Mahiru had said, so Amane stared back down at his workbook, to fool himself into<p></p>
        thinking he had nothing to say.<p></p>
        In the end, the gaming tournament lasted well into the evening.<p></p>
        Amane eventually took a break from his studies and joined in, too, when he found that<p></p>
        he could no longer focus. Except it wasn't just the fatigue of hours of study that affected<p></p>
        Amane's concentration.<p></p>
        What did she mean, she uses her energy on the people she wants to use it on?<p></p>
        Amane had been replaying Mahiru's quiet murmuring over and over again in his head.<p></p>
        He had always known that Mahiru did things for the people she liked, but when she<p></p>
        put it that way, it sounded like she held some special affection for Amane.<p></p>
        Amane certainly thought that Mahiru liked him, but his understanding was that it<p></p>
        wasn't in a romantic way. 1<p></p>
        The way she'd said that made him wonder if she was doing everything because she<p></p>
        liked him, not as a friend… His mind was running wild with the idea.<p></p>
        I mean, I would understand if she was doing all this work because I'm such a failure of a<p></p>
        human being, and she felt like she just had to step in, but…<p></p>
        In fact, Amane was bad enough at housework that he couldn't rule out the possibility.<p></p>
        He could survive on his own, if he really tried, but he did rely on Mahiru a lot.<p></p>
        He couldn't decide whether Mahiru just wanted to look after him, or whether she was<p></p>
        being overly caring because she was into him. Given his feelings for her, Amane would<p></p>
        have liked to imagine that it was the latter, and he didn't think that it was completely<p></p>
        hopeless. However, he still had serious doubts about whether he was the kind of<p></p>
        person Mahiru could ever actually love.<p></p>
        "…Amane? You fell out of the ring."<p></p>
        "Huh…?"<p></p>
        Amane had gotten lost in thought in the middle of a game, and unknowingly let his<p></p>
        character go out of bounds. Since he didn't have any more lives left, he was knocked<p></p>
        out of the game.<p></p>
        A close match unfolded between Itsuki, Chitose, and Yuuta. Amane hadn't expected<p></p>
        Yuuta to be so good at video games.<p></p>
        Normally, Amane would never make such an obvious mistake. That was how<p></p>
        distracted he was by Mahiru's comment.<p></p>
        "Your concentration must really be shot from studying, Amane. You're spaced out."<p></p>
        "…Must be," Amane agreed. "Mahiru, you want in on the next game?"<p></p>
        "No, I've got to get dinner ready soon, so…"<p></p>
        Mahiru glanced at the clock, and when Amane followed her gaze, he saw that it was<p></p>
        just short of seven o'clock. It was probably a little bit late to start dinner preparations.<p></p>
        "Oh, she's right, it's already so late… I've got to get going. I can't stay over, after all,"<p></p>
        Chitose said.<p></p>
        "Yeah, I'm sure you would have liked to stay at Shiina's place, Chi, but we didn't bring<p></p>
        you a change of clothes or anything. Plus, you didn't ask, and I doubt you would fit into<p></p>
        any of her clothes, after all…"<p></p>
        "Tell me, my darling Itsuki, just what do you mean by that?"<p></p>
        "I'm talking about your heights, of course, yes."<p></p>
        Mahiru giggled as she watched the couple cheerfully bicker, as they always did. "Come<p></p>
        over and stay next time."<p></p>
        "You sure?"<p></p>
        "I'm sure. As long as you tell me ahead of time."<p></p>
        "Well then, I'll stay over at Amane's at the same time," Itsuki added.<p></p>
        Amane frowned. "I have a feeling you're just angling for a meal…"<p></p>
        "You got me. Her cooking is just too delicious!" Itsuki laughed, with no ill intent.<p></p>
        With a sigh, Amane told him, "You know you've got to ask Mahiru, right?"<p></p>
        Mahiru would be the one who had to make all the extra food, so Amane couldn't very<p></p>
        well volunteer her.<p></p>
        If she didn't agree, then the boys could eat out or get convenience store food, which<p></p>
        would feel more like a party anyway, so it wouldn't be the worst thing.<p></p>
        Mahiru nodded her approval with a smile, and Amane had a feeling Chitose and Itsuki<p></p>
        would be staying over soon.<p></p>
        "Will Kadowaki be coming next time, too?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        "Oh, could I?"<p></p>
        "Well…," Amane began.<p></p>
        "If you come, let's have a 'kick Amane's butt into gear' party!" Itsuki interrupted.<p></p>
        "Hey, where do you get off planning weird parties?"<p></p>
        "Come on, how 'bout it?"<p></p>
        Amane's cheek twitched as Itsuki put on a broad grin. Yuuta was taken aback for a<p></p>
        moment but then smiled with relief.<p></p>
        "Hey, Mahiru?… What did you mean when you said that you use your energy on the<p></p>
        people you want to use it on?"<p></p>
        While they were standing in the entryway after seeing everybody else off, Amane<p></p>
        falteringly asked her the question that had been weighing on his mind all evening.<p></p>
        He had been wavering over whether to ask her about it, but he had been grumbling<p></p>
        about not knowing what to do as Itsuki left, and Itsuki had given him a little kick and<p></p>
        said, "Don't worry about it, man, just ask."<p></p>
        Amane hadn't been expecting a literal "kick in the butt," so he'd smacked Itsuki in<p></p>
        retaliation. Itsuki hadn't seemed particularly likely to learn his lesson, so it had felt<p></p>
        like a futile gesture.<p></p>
        Mahiru blinked at Amane. Slowly, the corners of her mouth curled into a smile. "…What<p></p>
        do you think I meant?"<p></p>
        "Like, that you can't let this useless guy out of your sight for a minute?"<p></p>
        Amane was too self-conscious to say anything rash, as he didn't want to come off as<p></p>
        arrogant.<p></p>
        "Heh-heh, well, that's true. I'm afraid to take my eye off you. If I wasn't here, you'd<p></p>
        really be in trouble."<p></p>
        "I can't argue with that."<p></p>
        Mahiru truly did take extremely good care of him. If she wasn't around, Amane would<p></p>
        never be able to maintain his current lifestyle.<p></p>
        "…It's fine, you know? I like taking care of you, Amane."<p></p>
        "I'd let myself go to pieces… without you, I'd fall apart and wither away…"<p></p>
        "Heh-heh."<p></p>
        The frightening thing about Mahiru was that Amane knew that if she left, his whole<p></p>
        life would become an emotional wreck.<p></p>
        In several senses, he had become something like her prisoner. It would be impossible<p></p>
        for him to leave her—and he didn't want to. Needless to say, the main reason was<p></p>
        because he was in love with her.<p></p>
        If he were to confess his feelings and be rejected, he was sure he would feel like death,<p></p>
        emotionally and physically. Amane laughed at himself but didn't tell her that was why<p></p>
        he hadn't been able to move forward.<p></p>
        Mahiru stepped toward him, inexplicably. She didn't press up against him, but she was<p></p>
        close enough that they were just lightly touching. She drew close to Amane until she<p></p>
        was right in front of him and looked up—then with her index finger, she traced the<p></p>
        outline of his lips.<p></p>
        "…I'm going to spoil you as much as I like, so just relax and enjoy it, okay?"<p></p>
        Mahiru narrowed her eyes impishly at Amane. He realized he'd forgotten how to<p></p>
        breathe.<p></p>
        Mahiru was wearing a smile he had never seen before. It was sweet, yet provocative…<p></p>
        even enchanting. It could even be called devilish and was enough to bewitch anyone.<p></p>
        Amane could feel it tugging at his emotions.<p></p>
        He could also feel his heart pounding and the blood rushing through his veins.<p></p>
        Amane had seen many of Mahiru's smiles, from her beautiful angelic one, to a subtle,<p></p>
        vanishing smirk, to a cherubic grin, but she had never given him such a flirtatious look<p></p>
        before.<p></p>
