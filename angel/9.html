        "You need to eat a properly balanced diet." With the costs of his dinners piling up,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane also felt awkward about going out to eat for lunch.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        What to do for his midday meal was quickly becoming an issue.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I wonder if I should cook something?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Without any errands that would take Amane out of the house, he sat at home by<p></p>
        <p></p>
        himself. Noon was only an hour away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had likely already gotten started making something for herself, but the same<p></p>
        <p></p>
        could not be said for her hapless neighbor.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When it came down to it, Amane could make something if he really had to. It wasn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like in manga where he'd churn out some censored blob. While it wouldn't look<p></p>
        <p></p>
        particularly fantastic and might not taste spectacular, the food Amane was capable of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        creating was edible. It wasn't exactly cooking, but it was close enough, and it kept him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The problem was that he'd grown accustomed to Mahiru's top-rate meals, so the idea<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of going back to his own dishes was not particularly appealing. Nobody would want to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        go back to such plain fare after sampling such delicious works of art.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …Augh, Mahiru really spoils me.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had become a slave to Mahiru's cooking. He felt ashamed at the thought of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        going out to eat again, but he'd also lost interest in convenience-store meals.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Deciding that he'd been depending on Mahiru too much, Amane concluded this was a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        good time to challenge himself. Even though he'd failed when it came to preparing his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        own meals thus far.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru wouldn't be with him forever, after all. Things between them were nice and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        reliable for now, but there were still two years of high school left, so if anything<p></p>
        <p></p>
        happened during that time, this relationship of theirs might come to an abrupt end.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        What's more, they would surely go their separate ways when it came time for college.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was no way things would simply go on like this indefinitely.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I guess I'd better try to put in a little effort now, while I still have her around.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Resolving to do something, even if it was relatively minor, Amane stood up from the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sofa and grabbed his wallet.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, did you go to the supermarket?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        On his way back from the store, Amane ran into Mahiru in the apartment lobby. He<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wasn't sure if the coincidental meeting was good or bad. Mahiru looked like she'd also<p></p>
        <p></p>
        just gone out, because she was carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery<p></p>
        <p></p>
        store.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah," Amane admitted. There was no need to hide it, so Amane waved his supermarket<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bags to show her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With a curious expression, Mahiru asked, "Oh, was the shopping from yesterday not<p></p>
        <p></p>
        enough? Didn't you buy everything on the list?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "N-no, that's not it… It's just… I thought I might try making lunch on my own," he said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…On your own?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Despite the explanation, Mahiru's eyes seemed full of doubt. It was only natural.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Before becoming dependent on Mahiru's cooking, Amane had survived by buying<p></p>
        <p></p>
        premade meals and convenience-store lunches. It must have been difficult for her to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        believe that he was really going to cook for himself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't want to say anything mean," Mahiru continued, "so I'll just tell you it would be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        safer for you to stop now. What if you burn yourself or get a cut?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You know, it's not like I literally can't cook anything at all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Right, it's just that you can't cook anything that tastes good. And that's assuming you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        don't kill yourself in the process."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's thorough dressing down left Amane speechless. She'd said exactly what he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        himself had been thinking.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If you say you're going ahead with it, I won't stop you," Mahiru said, "but manage your<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expectations, or you'll end up severely disappointed."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Fair enough," Amane conceded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        By "expectations" she must have been referring to her own cooking. Mahiru was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        confident in her abilities, and she was well aware how much Amane enjoyed her food.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's just that, well, you're always talking about nutrition and stuff. There might be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some time in the future when I really have to live on my own, like college. I can't rely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on you forever, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Overdependence on Mahiru only spelled trouble for Amane. After realizing how much<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had been spoiling him lately, he felt like he ought to be able to at least manage<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the basics.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's eyes went wide at Amane's words, then she let out a sigh that sounded just<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the slightest bit impressed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I think it's a great thing to set your eyes on the future, but if you're going to do that,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shouldn't you have come to me first?" she posed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Rather than making whatever kind of mess you're about to do without my supervision,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it would be much better for me to watch and ensure nothing goes wrong. Amane, are<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you confident that you won't accidentally destroy your kitchen?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…No." Amane sighed. He knew he made a terrible mess of his kitchen whenever he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tried to use it. With no rebuttal, he gave Mahiru a slow nod.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It figures," Mahiru replied stolidly. "That's why it's better for me to be there, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Would that be asking too much?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If I didn't want to do it, I wouldn't have suggested the idea." Her voice had a bit of a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cold edge to it, but since she was agreeing to help him, Amane didn't mind. He bowed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        deeply to express his gratitude.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You don't need to be so formal," Mahiru said, sounding flustered. Amane smiled, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the two stepped into the elevator, taking it up to their floor.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…By the way, do you have an apron?" Mahiru inquired.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No problems on that front. I bought one for cooking class."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And did you use it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "There was really no point. All I did was measure ingredients and wash dishes."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Figures." Mahiru sighed, as if that was exactly what she had suspected. She accompanied<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane into his apartment. There was actually another apron already there, one that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had left behind. Amane would've felt fairly uncomfortable using that one,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        however.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Donning the apron she kept at Amane's place, Mahiru gathered her hair up into a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ponytail, like she usually did. Eyes narrowed, she watched Amane put on the dark
        <p></p>
        colored apron that he had pulled from the back of a dresser drawer.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Wow, I've never seen you in that before, Amane. It kind of feels like the apron's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wearing you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, well, excuuuse me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I guess there's nothing we can do about that. So you've already decided what you plan<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to make, right? Since you went and bought the ingredients." Mahiru took a peek at the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shopping bag that Amane had set on a shelf.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane nodded. "Stir-fried vegetables and an omelet."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Veggie stir-fry because I've been scolding you to eat more vegetables and an omelet<p></p>
        <p></p>
        because you like eggs, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Bull's-eye."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's not like it was a difficult guess. What seasonings do you have for the stir-fry?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "This: yakiniku sauce."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh… straight from the bottle, huh? I suppose it has that robust flavor that boys like…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and I guess it is tasty…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's better than me trying to make something from scratch, isn't it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If Amane had no yakiniku sauce on hand, he'd planned on whipping up something that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        used salt, pepper, and soy sauce instead. Truthfully, he was glad that he did have the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        yakiniku sauce. Amane whispered a silent expression of gratitude for his good fortune<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of still having a condiment he could use, then he followed Mahiru's example and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        washed his hands.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        While he did that, Mahiru was arranging all the necessary utensils and lining up the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ingredients so they would be easy to use. Truly, the angel's efficiency knew no bounds.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "For the veggie stir-fry, you just need to cut the vegetables up and fry them until<p></p>
        <p></p>
        they're cooked evenly through, okay?… Do you know how to cut them?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Are you making fun of me?" Amane replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was obvious he knew that much. He wasn't very good at it, but he could handle a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        knife.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Under Mahiru's careful supervision, Amane began to finely slice up some cabbage, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he quickly realized how meaningless his earlier words had been after he cut his own<p></p>
        <p></p>
        finger.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        First Amane had been shown how to do it, and then Mahiru left him to try on his own<p></p>
        <p></p>
        while she watched. He'd done fine in the beginning, while Mahiru was helping him get<p></p>
        <p></p>
        used to the task, but as soon as she'd left Amane on his own, he'd slipped up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Owww," he mumbled, looking down at his finger. It was only a small cut, but it was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bleeding.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The first thing to do was wash it, but of course getting it wet would sting, too.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I thought something like this might happen. Here, give me that." Mahiru took a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bandage from her apron pocket and skillfully wound it around Amane's hurt finger.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was equal parts grateful and impressed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're very prepared," he complimented.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Beginners often hurt themselves."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You have no faith in me, do you?" Despite such an accusation, Amane knew full well<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that there was no reason for her to think he was even slightly capable. He'd hurt<p></p>
        <p></p>
        himself almost immediately, after all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I do recognize that you were trying your best," Mahiru consoled. "That's wonderful."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Gee, thanks."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I still would have liked you to ask me ahead of time, though."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You say that, but it would've been awful to make you cook lunch for me, too, especially<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on a weekend."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I know you're trying to handle things by yourself, but if you mess up and it becomes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a whole situation that ends with calling me anyway… It would be easier to have just<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been here from the start."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Fine."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        This time, Amane had gotten away with only a light injury, but if some terrible kitchen<p></p>
        <p></p>
        disaster had happened instead, or if he had used some appliance wrong and it stopped<p></p>
        <p></p>
        working, he knew he wouldn't have been able to deal with it on his own. Mahiru was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        absolutely right.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…And please don't ever try to fry anything. You'll start a fire," she added.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm nowhere near advanced enough to make fried food," Amane admitted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't think it's actually quite that difficult… Once again, I'm forced to wonder how<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you survived on your own all this time," Mahiru quipped.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry about all this," Amane replied in a sulky voice. "Now you know why I was living<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on convenience-store food."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru looked at him with concern on her face. Amane wasn't particularly disheartened<p></p>
        <p></p>
        or angry, so she had nothing to worry about, but Mahiru cast her eyes downward,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seemingly a little troubled about something anyway.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…It's just—I'm scared of the idea of you making fried foods, Amane, so if you really<p></p>
        <p></p>
        want some, please come ask me instead."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right then, tomorrow I want to eat fried mince cutlets." Immediately recovering<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his good humor, Amane was already putting in a request for the next day's dinner.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru gave a small, relieved sigh once she heard that.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, but you're eating plenty of cabbage salad on the side. And I'm making miso<p></p>
        <p></p>
        soup with lots of vegetables, got it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, yeah. And… thank you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "For what?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "For everything."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru did so much for Amane every day and still found time to worry about him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was truly grateful, even if he sometimes said stupid, hurtful things. He wasn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sure where he'd be without her. Admitting as much felt a little embarrassing, though.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You help me a lot," he murmured very quietly. He then promptly turned back to the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        vegetables.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Let's eat."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sounds good."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Grappling with the vegetables had taken nearly an hour, but it had been worth it. On<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the table was a stir-fry made from clumsily cut greens, a beautifully shaped omelet…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and a pile of scrambled eggs.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Naturally, the beautiful omelet was one Mahiru had made in an attempt to provide<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane with something to use as a reference. While Amane had tried his best to make<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a second omelet, he'd ended up with scrambled eggs instead.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The failed attempt was set in front of Mahiru so she could evaluate his work. The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        picture-perfect example, the platonic ideal of omelets, had been prepared for Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After pressing her hands together in thanks for the food, Mahiru grabbed a piece of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the tattered eggs with her chopsticks to check the taste.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…It's flavorless scrambled eggs, all right. Didn't you add any salt or pepper?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I forgot. Plus, I was supposed to be making an omelet."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You scrambled it up too much. What were you thinking, mixing it with the chopsticks<p></p>
        <p></p>
        until it fell apart? I warned you about that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had forgotten to add the seasonings because he'd mixed up his egg while<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was making her omelet. Otherwise, he'd been under careful supervision<p></p>
        <p></p>
        throughout the whole process. The lacking flavor and shape of his eggs was clearly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's own fault.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        On the other hand, Mahiru's dish was soft, fluffy, and unspeakably delicious. The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        difference between them was night and day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I think, for you, it was a really good attempt. The most important thing is that you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tried. Still, I'm worried that if I let you try it on your own, the cleanup afterward will<p></p>
        <p></p>
        be awful, so I'd like you to take it slow, okay?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm going to become totally reliant on you," Amane replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's a little late for that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ugh…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Just joking. Well, not really, but I like that you appreciate my cooking, and I don't hate<p></p>
        <p></p>
        teaching you to cook, either, so… really, you don't have to worry."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Thanks again—for everything."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was really thanks to Mahiru's kindness that Amane was able to live as well as he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was. He owed her quite a bit, but he knew that Mahiru would hate it if he groveled too<p></p>
        <p></p>
        much, so he held his head high.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Curiously, Mahiru was wearing a slightly lonesome expression as she said, "If you do<p></p>
        <p></p>
        learn how to cook, Amane, I guess I'll be relieved of my duties."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was certainly true that when Amane learned to fix his own meals, there would be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        no need for Mahiru to do it for him anymore, but Amane shook his head.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, that's… I mean… Your cooking is the best, Mahiru, so please… I want to keep<p></p>
        <p></p>
        eating it for as long as I can. Though, I guess that's kinda shameless of me to ask."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane would never have denied it was selfish of him to want Mahiru to continue<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cooking for him, but at the same time, her food was obviously leagues better than his,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and he couldn't turn it away. The addiction had long since set in, and Amane was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        terrified of being cut off.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's eyes widened at the humble plea, and she smiled slightly. The vague tinge of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        loneliness vanished in an instant.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ha-ha. You really are hopeless, aren't you? Well, I don't intend to stop, so you can<p></p>
        <p></p>
        relax."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Thanks," Amane said, feeling relieved that the shade of anxiety he'd seen on her face<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was gone, replaced with a faint smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How about I get you to help me out sometimes? Peeling vegetables, measuring<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ingredients, things like that," Mahiru proposed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Like a kid helping in the kitchen."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane, that's where you need to start, you know?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Since Amane's skill level truly was on par with a child's, there was really nothing he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        could say back. Mahiru looked amused.<p></p>
        <p></p>

        13 Christmas with Everyone<p></p>
        "Hey, Amane, can we have a Christmas party at your place?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nope."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The proposal had been immediately shot down, and Chitose puffed out her cheeks to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        make her disappointment obvious.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Christmas Eve was fast approaching, but since Amane lived separately from his family<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and was a loner by nature, the holiday didn't hold any real significance. Still, Chitose<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and Itsuki seemed keen on spending it with him and had come to ask him about<p></p>
        <p></p>
        holding a little celebration.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose had gone out of her way to barge into Amane and Itsuki's classroom at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        lunchtime with the idea, and now she had her cheeks puffed out because of Amane's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        near-instant refusal.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come on, Amane," Itsuki angled. "You're alone anyway… ah, unless maybe there's a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        girlfriend in the picture?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, there isn't."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well then, it's fine!" Chitose interjected. "Or could it be that you secretly hate us?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, if Amane hates us, then I guess we don't need him, either," Itsuki added.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In their own way, his friends were probably expressing their concern for him. There<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was also the possibility that they were hunting for a place where they could relax and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        flirt. Amane felt bad about refusing them, even when they made such exaggeratedly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        disappointed faces at him. He didn't actually hate them.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That was not to say Amane had no concerns, however. First was the thought of how<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the two of them would act in a private setting. Amane could feel the embarrassment<p></p>
        <p></p>
        washing over him at the mere thought of Itsuki and Chitose's shameless intimacy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Then there was the fact that he would have to explain things to Mahiru. She would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have to steer clear until Amane's friends left, and he would have to be very careful<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about covering up any evidence of her frequent visits.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Fine. I get it, I get it. The twenty-fourth, right? I have a condition, though: You have to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        set me free before nightfall and go somewhere else together to get all your flirting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        done. I'll remind you that excessive physical contact is prohibited in my apartment."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With Amane's concession to the couple's demands, Chitose's face lit up with a smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Guess there's nothing we can do about that rule. I'm sure we can work something<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out," she said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Who do you think you are to say such entitled things?" Amane quickly grabbed one<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of Chitose's cheeks and pinched.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Owwsh!" she slurred. "Itsukiii, Amane's buwwyying me!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come on, Amane, don't be mean to Chi! I'm the only one who's allowed to pinch her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cheeks," Itsuki said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Fine, fine; pinch her real good for me, then," Amane replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Leave it to me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't you dare!" Chitose cried.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane entrusted Itsuki to carry out the sentence, but as one might've expected, he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and Chitose turned it into just another excuse to flirt. Within moments, the two of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        them started messing around, playfully pinching each other's faces.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Now Chitose actually looked happy to be pinched.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane shrugged. "…Can I go?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        This was Amane's classroom, but he wanted to get some distance from the
        <p></p>
        lovey-dovey couple before they got any more insufferable.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No way! We've got to make proper plans. We need to arrange for food and a cake!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not making anything."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was no way Amane could fix a Christmas meal. Mahiru could handle it, no<p></p>
        <p></p>
        problem, but there was absolutely no way he could get her help this time. That's why<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane quickly brushed off the idea, insisting that it would be impossible for him to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cook. Chitose didn't seem convinced, however, and was staring at him strangely.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I was just thinking you look awfully healthy for someone who can't cook," Chitose<p></p>
        <p></p>
        said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So? What's the problem?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, you see, Chi, Amane's got his own reasons for that," Itsuki commented.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh, well, don't you want to know about them, too, Itsuki?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'll get him to spill later."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not telling you a thing."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane glared at Itsuki as if to tell him not to make promises he couldn't keep, and he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        laughed out loud, in a forced way. Itsuki knew when to let things go, but he had a bad<p></p>
        <p></p>
        habit of dredging up old stuff at rather inopportune times.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You guys are a real handful…," Amane muttered. "Well, for dinner, can't we get takeaway<p></p>
        <p></p>
        or something? We'll have to order the cake if we want one." Attempting to move away<p></p>
        <p></p>
        from his own affairs that the couple seemed so eager to pry into, he made a pragmatic<p></p>
        <p></p>
        proposal.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was no way he could make a cake or prepare a meal on his own, so arranging<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for ready-made food seemed to be the way to go.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, all right then, let's have pizza! I'll book a cake from my usual place; they're still<p></p>
        <p></p>
        taking orders!" Chitose declared.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You don't want chicken?" asked her boyfriend.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You like pizza better, too, don't you, Itsuki?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "True, true. That's my Chi; you know me best."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Eh-heh-heh…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        While the two lovebirds had decided on what to get without discussing it at all with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane, he was fine with pizza. Something like that made it feel more like a party<p></p>
        <p></p>
        anyway. Given the way things were going, they would probably pick up some takeaway<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pizzas from the shop that Amane and Itsuki often visited.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The moment Amane heard the word pizza, he thought of Mahiru—and when she'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nibbled her pizza like a small animal. Amane had found it strangely charming, probably<p></p>
        <p></p>
        because he usually saw her eating so elegantly. Come to think of it, he'd gotten Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to eat cake the other day, too. Amane's cheeks glowed warmly as he remembered that.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I won't do anything like that again, Amane vowed to himself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It'd been so embarrassing to feed each other; there was no way Amane could endure<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a repeat of that. Mahiru and Amane weren't some affectionate couple like Itsuki and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose, so the opportunity should never come up again anyway.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Hey, Amane, what's up?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, no, nothing. All right, we'll leave the cake order up to you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had drifted back into some embarrassing memories for a moment, and Chitose<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had started staring at him with a concerned expression, puzzled. Panicking, Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chased the flustering thoughts from his head and did his best to be casual.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right! Let's get our pizza order in, too!" he said, a bit more worked up than usual.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With Chitose's excitable voice still ringing in his ears, Amane returned home and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        decided to ask Mahiru about her Christmas plans.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Christmas plans? I don't really have any," Mahiru replied quickly from her place on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the sofa. Amane had posed the question after finishing the dishes and joining her in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the living room. He'd been confident Mahiru would be going to a girls' party, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apparently, she didn't have anything lined up. Maybe Amane's surprise showed,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        because Mahiru made an annoyed face at him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Basically, all the girls I know and most of my female classmates have boyfriends to go<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out with. And I always turn down all the boys who invite me out, so my schedule is<p></p>
        <p></p>
        totally open," she explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Breaking all the hearts, huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Whenever she was out in public, Mahiru kept her guard up, and any hopeful suitors<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were sure to end up drowning in their own tears when faced with the angel's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        impregnable defenses.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Still, Amane had to respect anyone who had the guts to ask Mahiru out. No one would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        be able to do such a thing without a huge amount of self-confidence, and Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        admired those optimistic types.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I wonder why boys want to spend Christmas with me so badly anyway?" Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wondered aloud.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "They're probably hoping to get to know you better," Amane explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What for?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, because they want to date you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And why would they want to date me?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Probably to do all the sorts of… things that dating people do."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How obscene."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane offered a silent prayer for all the guys who'd just been ruthlessly discarded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I don't think every one of them is like that, so don't be too distrustful. I'm sure<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you understand that you're the sort of girl who draws all their eyes."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're right. It's unlikely that all of them are harboring lewd thoughts. After all, you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        aren't like that, are you, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Have I ever treated you that way?" Amane had certainly thought Mahiru looked cute,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        or that he wanted to rub her head, but he'd never gone so far as to fantasize about<p></p>
        <p></p>
        being intimate with her. If such things ever did cross his mind, Amane was sure that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru would likely notice and pull away from him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was only because Mahiru saw Amane as a harmless puppy that he could sit there<p></p>
        <p></p>
        next to her. Baring so much as a single fang could be enough to send her running away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The needs of Amane's stomach ranked higher in his mind than other appetites, so he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had no intention of jeopardizing his relationship with Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I suppose you're right. You never seemed to have any interest in me from the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        beginning, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm-hmm."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's why I trust you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, thanks for that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As a guy, Amane wasn't sure how he felt about Mahiru's reasons for trusting him, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for the time being, he decided he was okay with being the "safe guy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…So, Amane, did you have something in mind when you asked me about my Christmas<p></p>
        <p></p>
        plans?" Mahiru inquired.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm? Oh, on the afternoon of the twenty-fourth, Itsuki and Chitose are coming over,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so I thought I would let you know that, uh, our usual dinner might have to start late."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Having returned to the original topic of conversation, Amane carefully explained the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        situation while Mahiru nodded along.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I understand. Please call me once your Christmas party is over, and I'll make dinner<p></p>
        <p></p>
        then. I'll try to take care of the prep work ahead of time," Mahiru said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sure; sorry about all that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's fine. Have fun."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You won't be lonely?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm used to spending Christmas alone."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's casual attitude about spending the holiday alone struck Amane as rather<p></p>
        <p></p>
        depressing. Perhaps thoughts of Christmas had reminded Mahiru of her parents,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        because a small, self-deprecating laugh slipped out.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Ah, um, this is really presumptuous of me to say, but… even if I can't do Christmas<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Eve, how about we spend Christmas Day together?" Amane felt extremely awkward<p></p>
        <p></p>
        making this sort of suggestion. He didn't have any particular ulterior motive, but two<p></p>
        <p></p>
        people getting together on the holiday usually did carry a certain implication.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There's no special meaning to this, Amane told himself. It was just that he hated when<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru looked so lonely; that was all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Surprised, Mahiru blinked quickly at the suggestion. "Together? Doing what?" she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh? Ah, well, I didn't really have anything in mind. Sorry." Now that it was obvious<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he didn't have a plan, Amane figured he should drop the issue. There was also the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        consideration that going out together meant there was a risk of being spotted by<p></p>
        <p></p>
        someone from school. That would be a huge problem for Amane and Mahiru both.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The best option would be spending time at home, but there was probably nothing in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's apartment that would interest Mahiru. It would likely boil down to just sitting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        next to each other, doing nothing, which would probably be incredibly awkward.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If that's all Amane could offer, he suspected it was probably better to just spend the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        day apart. As he prepared to withdraw his proposal, he noticed that Mahiru was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        staring at him quietly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Okay. I'd like to try that," It was unexpected, but Mahiru actually seemed interested.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her slim finger was pointing at the television. To be more precise, she was pointing at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the game console housed inside the TV stand.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Recently, Mahiru had been visiting in the evenings, so Amane hadn't booted up the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        system much, but it seemed like Mahiru was curious about it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I've never used one of those things…," she confessed in a small voice.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane didn't have any concrete reason to refuse Mahiru if she wanted to try playing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        games, but the thought of a guy and girl who weren't dating or anything spending<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Christmas day together playing video games was somewhat surreal. Even if he wasn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hoping for anything romantic, it was only natural that the idea gave rise to a confusing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mix of emotions.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, well, that'd be fine, but… is that okay? To spend the day gaming?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is there anything wrong with that?" Mahiru replied with her own question.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I guess not, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, then let's go with that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "S-sure."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Great, I guess that's what we're doing…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Since it was what Mahiru wanted, Amane resolved himself to do everything he could<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to make sure it happened. He wanted to at least give her this modest bit of enjoyment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was always taking care of him, and she hardly ever asked for anything, so he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would let her play anything she wanted, as long as he had it in his collection. It wasn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like he had any plans on Christmas Day anyway, so this was a small price indeed for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's fantastic cooking.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, we can have a laid-back day that doesn't have anything to do with Christmas<p></p>
        <p></p>
        or whatever," Amane declared.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Then it's decided," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane found it difficult to look directly at Mahiru's smiling face, so instead he nodded<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and turned away while doing his best to look casual.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Merry Christmas!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Christmas Eve arrived before too long.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        School had already let out for winter break, and everyone was probably spending the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        day enjoying themselves. Itsuki and Chitose had shown up at Amane's apartment,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        party supplies in hand, at around one in the afternoon.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        On the table, the pizza and juice they had ordered for delivery were already laid out.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The three had actually planned to meet up a bit earlier, but the Christmas crowds had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slowed everything down and put them all behind schedule. Thankfully, it was only an<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hour past noon, and Amane hadn't been waiting too long, so no one seemed all that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bothered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, yeah, Merry Christmas," Amane replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane, you don't sound very excited! Try again," Chitose instructed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Merry Christmas!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're saying the words just fine, but you're not really in the spirit, are you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane didn't like to be compared to Chitose, who was very excitable by nature.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Realizing that she was even more worked up than usual, Itsuki did his best to placate<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose. He flashed a flippant, yet still-warm smile at his girlfriend.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come on, we don't need to worry about that. Let's get to the eating part and the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        having-a-good-time part and then the falling-asleep part," said Itsuki.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You can't sleep here, idiot," Amane snapped.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm just kidding, geez. Besides, if I am gonna sleep, I'm going to Chi's place."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You'll have to do that when her parents aren't around."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh, Amaneee! What kind of perverted things are you thinking?!" Chi cried. She was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        grinning, but Amane didn't respond. Instead, he made for the kitchen to grab some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cups and utensils. Pouting, Chitose looked briefly disappointed at this lack of reaction<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but then quickly followed after him, shouting that she would help.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The kitchen was, naturally, neat and tidy, with everything in order. Mahiru had made<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it her territory as of late, so all the various tools and seasonings were lined up for easy<p></p>
        <p></p>
        access.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Whoa, this is way cleaner than I expected," Chitose commented.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thanks a lot," Amane responded idly. He took small plates for individual portions and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some cups out of a kitchen cupboard. When he tried to hand half to Chitose, he found<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her staring fixedly at the cupboard.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…What is it?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nothing!" she answered hurriedly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane felt something devious behind Chitose's sly smile, and a shiver shot down his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        back. The best course of action for the time being was to ignore her entirely, however,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so Amane did his best to act like nothing was wrong. He had a terrible feeling Chitose<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was brewing up some elaborate misconception, but since she hadn't said anything,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wasn't sure what it could be.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Grimacing, Amane and Chitose returned to the living room where Itsuki was waiting.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was becoming abundantly clear that Chitose was in an even better mood than when<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she'd first arrived.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Seriously, though, your apartment is super clean. It's so big and luxurious," Chitose<p></p>
        <p></p>
        muttered. The three friends had mostly finished eating. They'd been listening to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Christmas music through the speakers in the living room.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was little Amane could say in response to Chitose's comment. He was living in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a nice apartment because his parents were paying for it, and the place was only this<p></p>
        <p></p>
        clean because Mahiru had helped him keep it that way. After considering that, all<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could say was "Yeah, thanks."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's definitely impressive how much better the place looks now that it's clean…," Itsuki<p></p>
        <p></p>
        remarked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shut up…," Amane shot back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yep, yep, I smell a girl!" Chitose added.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How did you make that jump?" Amane had no idea how Chitose made the connection<p></p>
        <p></p>
        between his clean apartment and a feminine presence.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm? Call it a woman's intuition. The way everything's arranged is a little off for you,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        personality-wise. There's something about the way the books are lined up and how<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the cords are all gathered to keep them from getting tangled or torn. Plus, there are all<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sorts of cooking implements in the kitchen that seem like they really don't belong to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…They're my mom's," Amane lied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Preemptively, Amane had shoved all of Mahiru's things into the back of a cabinet, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose must have caught sight of them when Amane had been getting the plates.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's tableware alone hadn't been enough, so Mahiru had brought a few things<p></p>
        <p></p>
        over from her place, but Amane hadn't expected Chitose to notice. For better or worse,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she was not the kind of person who usually paid attention to such details.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, it's not like we care that much, right, Itsuki?" Amane's reply had been suspiciously<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slow. Sensing a deeper meaning in that, Chitose leaned over to Itsuki, grinning.<p></p>
