        <p></p>
        slipped the pants on.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane snatched up his blazer and handed Mahiru the parka he'd been wearing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Here, wear this," he told her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Wait, but why?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Do you want to be seen being carried?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Letting Mahiru walk on her ankle was a bad idea. Amane had been planning to bring<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her home from the start. They were both headed to the same place, after all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, sorry, but could you put my backpack on?" Amane asked. "I can't carry you on my<p></p>
        <p></p>
        back if I'm wearing it, obviously."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is there an option where you don't carry me?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Look here, your ankle is twisted, so you need to rest it. No one's around, and I've got<p></p>
        <p></p>
        perfectly good legs, so please put them to use."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Your legs?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What, you'd prefer my arms? Would you rather I support you from the side?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Are you even strong enough to carry me all that way?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Are you making fun of me?… Well, I'm actually not that confident."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane knew he could support Mahiru if she leaned on him, but honestly, it would be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        quite difficult to fully carry her all the way back to the apartment complex. What's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        more, it would be sure to attract a lot of attention, which Amane preferred to avoid.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He knew that Mahiru had been poking fun when she'd brought up his strength, so he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smiled, glad she was feeling well enough to crack jokes like that.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Look, if you're game, put the hood up and wear my backpack. After you get on my back,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        take your own bag, too, while you're at it. I won't be able to hold it if I'm supporting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you," Amane instructed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Sorry," Mahiru muttered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm telling you: It's fine. It wouldn't be very manly of me to leave an injured person<p></p>
        <p></p>
        behind and go home—or to make you walk."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane crouched down and turned away from her, and Mahiru timidly leaned onto<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was wearing Amane's parka, so she had on even more clothes than normal,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but even so, he could feel her body pressed against him, slim and willowy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After confirming that Mahiru's arms were secured around his neck without choking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him, Amane stood up slowly, carrying the injured girl on his back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I knew it; she's so light, Amane thought. He wondered if he should be the one worrying<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about her diet instead of the other way around. It was more likely that she was just<p></p>
        <p></p>
        naturally petite, though; that was probably all it was.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru smelled slightly sweet, and though Amane could tell all sorts of things about<p></p>
        <p></p>
        how anxious she was feeling based on how tightly she clung to him, he headed for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        home without showing it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A few people did stare at the sight of a guy carrying someone on his back, but Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had completely covered her face with the hood of his parka, so Amane wasn't too<p></p>
        <p></p>
        worried about what little attention was being paid to them.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, here we are." Amane carried Mahiru as far as her front door, then let her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        down and quickly turned to leave without interfering any further.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Since Mahiru could get around on her own while leaning on a wall, Amane guessed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that her injury was probably not all that serious. Thankfully, it was Friday, so Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had plenty of time to rest her ankle and get back on her feet with no problems.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't need dinner tonight, so you should rest. If you like, I could bring you some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nutritional supplements," Amane offered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm fine. I have some stuff prepared," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's good. See ya."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That was the most important thing: that food wouldn't be a problem. It was essential<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that Mahiru be able to keep still and rest. Amane watched her open the lock on her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        front door, and he, too, took out his apartment key.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Um," started Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Amane heard the girl's voice and turned around, he saw that she was looking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        up at him timidly, clutching her bag to her chest. She looked somewhat troubled, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as he tilted his head in confusion, she seemed to regain her resolve and looked straight<p></p>
        <p></p>
        into his eyes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Thank you for what you did today. You really saved me," Mahiru admitted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's fine, really. I just did it because I wanted to. Take care." Embarrassed by the notion<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of Mahiru fretting over his help, Amane quickly dismissed the thought from his mind.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After Mahiru gave him a quick nod, Amane turned to unlock his own door. It was only<p></p>
        <p></p>
        then that Amane realized that Mahiru was still wearing his parka and athletic pants,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but he was sure she would return them another day, so he slipped into his apartment<p></p>
        <p></p>
        without saying anything.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Damn, dude, you so healthy that you wear shorts year-round now?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's melancholy in Monday's gym class had less to do with his lack of athletic<p></p>
        <p></p>
        talent and more to do with the fact that he was wearing knee-length jersey shorts<p></p>
        <p></p>
        during an unpleasantly cold season. Everyone else had already switched to their<p></p>
        <p></p>
        winter gym uniforms, but Amane stood out from all the rest, his legs bare below the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        knee.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "As if. I just forgot my pants."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Idiot."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shut up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane hadn't seen Mahiru over the weekend, and she still had his gym pants, but he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        couldn't tell Itsuki that, so there was nothing to do but say that he forgot. He had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        resigned himself to the inevitable mockery, though when Itsuki slapped his back,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cackling with laughter, Amane still found it in himself to slap him back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane let out a soft sigh as he watched Itsuki groan quietly. Then his gaze shifted. At<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the moment, the boys were practicing their high jumps, and the girls were using the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        other side of the field. What's more, since two classes of students were using the field<p></p>
        <p></p>
        at once, it was fairly crowded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The girls were practicing different track-and-field events, so between taking turns, the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        girls had plenty of time to watch Amane's class.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Do your best, Kadowaki!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Usually, the boys and girls took gym class in different places on campus; with the girls<p></p>
        <p></p>
        present, the boys were getting all worked up. The girls, on the other hand, all spent<p></p>
        <p></p>
        their time watching Amane's most popular classmate, the handsome Yuuta Kadowaki.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had never really talked to him before, but he was nice to everyone and was a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        great student, and on top of that, he was the ace of the track club despite being only a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        first-year. Everyone knew he was popular with the girls. Amane figured Yuuta must<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have won some kind of karmic lottery. A lot of the other boys didn't care for him as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        much, and there were always a lot of sulky looks when he was around.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh wow, looks like Yuuta's as popular as always," Itsuki observed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Looks that way," Amane answered dully.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You don't seem too interested," Itsuki prodded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, it's not like we're friends or anything; we've barely ever spoken. So why should<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I care?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It wasn't as though Yuuta was mean or ever messed with Amane. They had nothing to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        do with each other, so Amane honestly did not care. He knew that he was in the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        minority there, but he couldn't bring himself to envy Yuuta the same way all the other<p></p>
        <p></p>
        boys did. More specifically, Amane knew that Yuuta was so far out of his league that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        envying him was pointless.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Typical Amane. What, you don't get jealous now?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, should I be like 'Wow, I'm sooo jealous of his populaaarity,' huh?" Amane mocked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That was pretty good." Itsuki guffawed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane looked over at Yuuta, who was wearing a brilliant smile and basking in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        feminine adoration. Even Amane had to admit that Yuuta's athletic body and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        handsome face made him look just like a prince. In fact, some girls had taken to calling<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him that.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Yuuta rewarded the girls' passionate gazes and shrill voices with another radiant<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smile and waved back at them. He really knew how to cultivate a following.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, he sure is popular, no arguing with that," admitted Itsuki.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I know. The other guys can't contain their jealousy," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ha-ha. But the girls are real energetic, too." Itsuki only had eyes for his girlfriend,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose. He had no interest in other girls, so he saw the Yuuta issue as everyone else's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        problem. Chitose wasn't the least bit interested in Yuuta, so Itsuki probably didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        spend much energy thinking about him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        We've got a prince and an angel… This school has a lot of people with cringey nicknames.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Come to think of it, I wonder if Mahiru the angel ended up getting enough rest. Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hadn't seen her leave her apartment over the weekend. It was good she was resting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        comfortably, but he still wondered about the state of her injury.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane stealthily scanned the field with his eyes. His class was sharing the field with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's, so she should've been there. Without too much effort, Amane spotted her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even in a crowd, the angel was easy to pick out. She hadn't changed into gym clothes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and wasn't practicing with the rest of her class. Evidently, she was sitting out today.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was sure that he was not the only boy staring at Mahiru, who sat there looking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        small and quiet. Though they were far away from each other, their eyes met suddenly,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and when Amane shifted his gaze around awkwardly, he saw a small smile pass over<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's lips. Since she was looking toward Amane, that meant she was also looking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        toward the rest of the boys. Each of Amane's classmates took the smile for their own,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nearly inciting a riot.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Did she just smile at me?!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No way; must be me!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "This is our chance! We've gotta impress her!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "The prince is hogging the spotlight."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        To think that Mahiru could cause such excitement with just one meager smile… Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        didn't know whether it was because she was that amazing or because the boys were<p></p>
        <p></p>
        all that simple.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Buncha morons," Itsuki muttered. He'd apparently been thinking the same thing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane chuckled. "Well, if we don't wanna fail gym class, we'd better get moving, too."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What's that, Amane? The angel's heavenly gaze got you all riled up, too?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, nothing like that. I told you, I'm not interested."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, guess I'll drop it, then. Since you don't care and all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki seemed like he was about to start boasting about how great girlfriends are,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        likely citing his own personal experience, but Amane was quick to brush him off.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, yeah," he said. He spared one more glance in Mahiru's direction and smiled<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wryly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thank you for what you did the other day. Here's your parka and sweatpants back."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That evening, when Mahiru brought him his portion of dinner, she was carrying a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        paper bag in addition to the plastic container. Amane could see at a glance that the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        parka and pants he had loaned her a few days ago were folded neatly in the bag.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm. How's the ankle?" he asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "The pain is already mostly gone. I've decided not to do any exercise until it's completely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        healed," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's for the best. Looks like you're sitting out gym class, too."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had decided to play it safe and not participate in gym, and Amane figured it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was probably the right thing to do. Her ankle didn't look like it was hurting her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        anymore, but she still slightly favored that leg when she walked, indicating that it was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        not yet entirely healed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Amane was nodding at the girl's sensible decision, he thought back on the day's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gym class and smiled suddenly. "You know, you're really amazing, Miss Angel. With a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        single smile, all the boys were practically bursting with excitement."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I told you to stop calling me that… And it's not as if I like that kind of attention. It<p></p>
        <p></p>
        really bothers me, you know," Mahiru said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, who wouldn't get fired up when a beautiful person looks at them? You know,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the girls started shrieking today, too, when Kadowaki waved at them."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Kadowaki… oh, that super-popular guy?" Mahiru didn't seem to be too interested in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the prince. Actually, it seemed like she didn't even recognize his name. Amane had to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        describe him a bit before Mahiru realized who he was talking about.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Yuuta wasn't as popular as the angel, but he was a fairly well-known boy in their grade,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so Amane was surprised that she didn't know who he was.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're not interested in him?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Not particularly. We're in different classes, and we've never really spoken," Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm. The other girls go bananas for him, though. They can't get enough of the cool<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dude."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, he does have a handsome face. But we don't talk; we don't have any connection.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        So I don't really care."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're so candid about things like that," Amane observed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, if looks are so important, don't you think it's strange that you don't like me?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        asked Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, so you do realize how beautiful you are?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was quite right in what she said. Beauty could be the spark that ignited greater<p></p>
        <p></p>
        affections, but it was rarely the sole source of love. Amane agreed with that, just as he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        agreed that Mahiru was very pretty. It was certainly a surprise to hear her say that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        herself, though.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I know that, objectively speaking, I'm considered very attractive, and I do work hard<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to maintain my appearance. It's only natural. Given how often people make a big deal<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about my looks, I can tell what they think of me even if I don't want to know." Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        didn't seem to be boasting in the least.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She was certainly being honest about how much effort she spent on her appearance.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had always had a good-looking face, but clearly she was not content to coast<p></p>
        <p></p>
        by on natural good looks. Her hair was like a radiant halo, befitting her angelic<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nickname, and the luster of her skin was also always perfect, without a single blemish.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her hands didn't get chapped, even when she was doing housework, and even her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fingernails were beautifully polished. The gentle curves of her body spoke to a
        <p></p>
        well-balanced figure that had likely taken some effort to cultivate.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm going to say something straight up, so don't get mad at me…," Amane began, "but…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you don't seem to be embarrassed by all this praise."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'd get annoyed before I'd get embarrassed if someone wouldn't stop flattering me,"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru answered curtly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Guess being beautiful has its own struggles."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Still, beauty does have its advantages, so I suppose I shouldn't complain."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You say that like you wouldn't know…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What? Would you rather I bashfully say 'Oh, no, that's not true!'?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, as someone who knows what you're really like, that would be weird."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Exactly. Honestly, I don't see the point in putting on an act like that in front of you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Glad to hear it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had only recently dropped her public persona around Amane, so if she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        changed back now… Amane could feel goosebumps prickling at the thought of facing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the distant angel he saw at school rather than the girl he was gradually getting to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        know.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In the end, things between the two of them remained as they were.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane looked at the food container he'd been handed. There was actually more food<p></p>
        <p></p>
        than usual. The container was packed with several side dishes, each one a large<p></p>
        <p></p>
        portion. Rather than leftovers, it was more like Amane had been handed a fancy boxed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        lunch.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Today's quite the smorgasbord," he said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Because you took such good care of me," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I told you not to worry about that… Oh, there are croquettes in here!" Amane could<p></p>
        <p></p>
        never say no to croquettes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Croquettes were frequently sold a la carte but could be a big pain to make yourself. As<p></p>
        <p></p>
        such, you could consider them the pinnacle of home cooking. After steaming potatoes,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mashing them, stirring in saute ed beef, onions, and more, and then forming the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        patties, you had to completely chill them, then add batter and fry them. It was a very<p></p>
        <p></p>
        involved process. Even Amane, who rarely cooked anything, had watched his mother<p></p>
        <p></p>
        make croquettes and had decided never to make them himself because they were such<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a pain.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I had them already made and chilling, so I only had to fry them," Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is that why there's fried chicken, too?" asked Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's right."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Living alone, Amane didn't get to eat a lot of fried dishes, so he was grateful for the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        handmade food. Of course, they were best when they were freshly made, while the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        coating was still nice and crispy, served with hot rice.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Sometime, I'd like to try them straight out of the oil," Amane muttered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had packed the fried chicken into the container after letting it cool, perhaps<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for hygienic reasons. So no matter what, Amane would need to warm the food back<p></p>
        <p></p>
        up. Though fried foods could be restored to a crispy texture via a toaster oven, it still<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wasn't the same as eating the stuff fresh. Amane had no doubts that Mahiru's cooking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would still be delicious, of course, but it would probably be even better right from the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pan.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane hadn't meant to whisper what he had been thinking; his desire had simply<p></p>
        <p></p>
        leaked from his lips. Unfortunately, he'd said it loud enough that Mahiru raised her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        eyebrows a little.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Are you inviting me over?" she asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's not what I'm saying at all! It's already too presumptuous of me to share your<p></p>
        <p></p>
        meals." Amane hadn't meant it that way at all, and he shrugged and vehemently denied<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru brought a hand to her mouth and directed her gaze downward. She seemed to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        be mulling something over and did not make eye contact with Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Your share," she finally said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Let me cook at your place, and we can consider that as part of paying for your share<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of the food expenses."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's sudden proposition left Amane's mouth hanging open in shock.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The accidental mention about eating the fried foods fresh had been more of a sardonic<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wish than anything else. That Mahiru had actually considered and agreed to it left<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane completely bewildered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Normally, who would think of going into the home of some boy they didn't know all<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that well to cook dinner? Maybe it would be more efficient to cook at his place rather<p></p>
        <p></p>
        than bring the food over after, but he was a member of the opposite sex, and it wasn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like they were close friends. Wouldn't doing that make Mahiru uneasy?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You definitely don't need to do that; I've already received way more than I could ask<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for, way more than I deserve… Aren't you worried about your safety?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If you try anything, I'll crush you. Hard. No mercy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ack, you're scary! I felt a chill."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I don't suppose it will come to that. You already know what the risks are, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I've decided you won't do anything. You know how popular I am at school, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Even supposing I did try something, it'd be the end of me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was vastly more popular than Amane, and on top of that, everyone saw her as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        this delicate girl, so if word got around that Amane had so much as thought about<p></p>
        <p></p>
        doing anything inappropriate to her, he was sure he'd never be able to set foot on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        school grounds again. Amane was not so foolish or so unprincipled as to try something<p></p>
        <p></p>
        knowing that it would mean, at best, social ruin. He wasn't interested anyway.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Besides…," Mahiru added.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Besides?" Amane asked, urging her to continue.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're not even the right type for someone like me," Mahiru asserted with a straight<p></p>
        <p></p>
        face, then suddenly smiled.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And what if I was your type?" Amane pressed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "First of all, I believe you were the one who insisted on talking to me. And then wanted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nothing to do with me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And that won you over?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, it told me that you're harmless enough," Mahiru explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh, thanks, I guess."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Whether that was a good thing or not, Amane couldn't deny it was true. After all, he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had never had any intention of doing anything with Mahiru in the first place. One thing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was certain, however: Amane was not going to pass up the chance to enjoy a freshly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        made meal. He accepted the title of harmless guy and gained the privilege of sharing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dinner.<p></p>
        <p></p>

        8 The First Meal Together<p></p>
        Mahiru was going to start cooking dinner at Amane's apartment, and she presented<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him with a list of conditions:<p></p>
        <p></p>
        • Amane would pay for half the cost of ingredients, plus an additional labor cost, plus<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the cost of any incidental expenses.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        • The two of them would each contact the other no later than the day before if they<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had something to do and couldn't eat together.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        • They would divide the work of shopping and cleaning up afterward.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Regarding the extra labor cost, it had taken some work to get Mahiru to agree to it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had insisted that he felt bad about all the time she was spending on him. It was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to be expected, since she did all the work making the food. Aside from that, though,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane and Mahiru had come to an agreement rather quickly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        And so, the day after their agreement had been ratified, Mahiru came over early holding<p></p>
        <p></p>
        supermarket bags in both hands and made preparations to start cooking.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…It's really all brand-new, like it's hardly been used…," Mahiru commented.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shut up," Amane shot back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A beautiful girl stood in his kitchen, and she was wearing an apron. This was like a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fantasy come to life. Amane was sure he was going to lose it any second now. When<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru pointed out, yet again, that he had really never used his kitchen, he felt a deep<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shame.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You've got an impressive collection of gadgets here, but they're like pearls tossed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        before swine," Mahiru observed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, if you use them, they won't go to waste," Amane reasoned.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's a poor excuse, after the fact. Your precious cookware is practically dying from<p></p>
        <p></p>
        neglect."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right then, bring it back to life with your amazing culinary talents. I sure as hell<p></p>
        <p></p>
        can't."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With gracious concession, Amane motioned for Mahiru to take over. She returned the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gesture with an exasperated expression, but perhaps because she'd expected as much,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she just sighed and didn't complain further.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, let's get started. Do you have any spices?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Of course I do; are you making fun of me? They're all properly stored—and none are<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expired, either."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Wow, I'm surprised."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's because they've never been opened."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's nothing to brag about. All right, if you don't have what we need, I can bring<p></p>
        <p></p>
        things over from my place to use this once."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That would be helpful."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "For now, if you have the basics, I think we can make do. Also, I decided on today's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dishes already; is that all right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't know much about cooking, so I'm happy with anything as long as I get to eat.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I don't have strong preferences."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Really? Then let's hurry up and get started… Please show me where you keep<p></p>
        <p></p>
        everything."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "In this basket."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "They're really unopened, huh…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru raised her eyebrows in shock as she stared at the basket filled with untouched<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seasonings. Perhaps because she'd been warned before she'd seen the unused spices,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she quickly reassumed her usual demeanor and began washing her hands at the sink.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, I'm going to start making stuff, so you can go wait in the living room or in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        your bedroom," Mahiru declared.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Okay. I can't help you with anything anyway," Amane accepted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What a gentleman. I suppose you'd just get in the way if you hung around."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're awfully honest."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's just the truth. There's no need to sugarcoat it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Mahiru said, he would clearly just be in the way, so Amane obediently returned to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the living room and watched her back as she worked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When she had finished washing her hands, Mahiru quickly set to work. Amane didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        know what she was making, but based on the ingredients she had readied, it was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        probably Japanese food.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Everything about this felt strange to Amane, like he was in a dream, but it was real.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was actually preparing the ingredients right there, her hair tied up in a gently<p></p>
        <p></p>
        swaying ponytail.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        What's with this situation? It's like I've got a wife or something, Amane thought.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru probably didn't feel the same way, but their setup looked a little too much like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        they were a happy family, and Amane couldn't help but imagine it. He didn't have even<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the smallest desire to live with Mahiru, but the sight of a beautiful girl standing in his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        kitchen was in itself enough to send his mind to all sorts of places. Whether or not<p></p>
        <p></p>
        there was any affection between Amane and Mahiru, just having a lovely girl treat him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to a home-cooked meal was enough to touch Amane's heart.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Are you thinking weird things over there?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You can stop with the strange speculations."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had frozen when Mahiru called him out. She'd guessed what he was thinking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        without even turning around.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She sure is sharp…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Feeling amazed and anxious all at once, Amane stamped down on the not-quite-evil<p></p>
        <p></p>
        base instincts that had begun welling up inside him and returned to staring at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        About an hour later, Mahiru began setting out completed dishes on the table.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She'd chosen to make Japanese food today, which was typical when one considered<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her penchant for healthy cooking.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It turns out you have quite a few utensils and seasonings, so it looks like I won't have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to bring anything from my place. Starting tomorrow, I can try more elaborate dishes,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        too."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, I'm just grateful you're making anything for me," Amane admitted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Perhaps because Mahiru hadn't known how many pieces of cookware and seasonings<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had in his collection, she had made many simple dishes rather than anything<p></p>
        <p></p>
        more intricate, but the presentation was flawless nonetheless.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Lined up along the table was an array of Japanese-style dishes. From fish simmered in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        soy sauce to dressed greens. From rolled omelets to miso soup. Every last item was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something Amane could never dream of making himself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Previously, Amane had said he didn't have any particular likes or dislikes, but he did<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in fact love Japanese food. He wanted to reassure Mahiru, who looked apologetic for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        having only prepared easy recipes, that this was exactly what he had wanted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…It looks amazing," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm happy to hear you say that. Eat up while it's still hot."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru sat down in a chair next to her, so Amane took a seat across the table.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His dining table was small, since he lived alone, so no matter how they sat, they were<p></p>
        <p></p>
        still close together. It was lucky that Amane happened to have two chairs just in case<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a guest stopped by, but seeing a beautiful girl sitting right before his eyes evoked some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        indescribable feeling from within him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Once Amane set upon the food, however, even Mahiru's beauty ceased to matter.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Hurriedly, he said "Let's eat" and started with the miso soup.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The moment he brought the bowl to his lips and took a sip, the fragrant miso and the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        flavor of the dashi spread through his mouth. The gentle taste was so completely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        different from instant miso soup. Amane could tell that it must have been prepared<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with great care. The miso flavor wasn't overpowering, and it was thoughtfully<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seasoned to allow the taste of the dashi broth to come through.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At first, Amane felt that the soup's taste was just a little bit strong, but after he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        considered drinking it while eating the other dishes, he realized that it struck the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        perfect balance and knew he would empty his bowl. Rather than being overwhelming,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the miso soup was a comforting flavor. It was a taste that made you want to eat more.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Delicious," Amane said with sincerity.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thank you for saying so." Mahiru's eyes crinkled in a relieved smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had been complimenting Mahiru's cooking for a while, but she'd probably been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        feeling nervous with this being the first time she'd cooked right in front of him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru watched Amane for a few moments before eating anything herself. Once she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        finally did start digging in, Amane extended his chopsticks toward the other dishes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Sampling a bit of each dish, it came as no surprise to Amane that everything Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had prepared was fantastic.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The simmered fish was bursting with juicy flavor without sacrificing its tenderness.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Usually when fish was cooked for a long time to bring out the taste, it would naturally<p></p>
        <p></p>
        lose some moisture and dry out, but this one was plump and had a nice texture.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As for the rolled omelets, they were tailored exactly to Amane's tastes. They were an<p></p>
        <p></p>
        enticingly vivid yellow, and when Amane stuffed one in his mouth, he was unsurprised<p></p>
        <p></p>
        by the gentle seasoning of dashi that greeted him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When it came to Japanese-style omelets, Amane knew, some people added sugar when<p></p>
        <p></p>
        making them, while others only used salt. These rolled ones had been flavored with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dashi, however. In addition to the rich taste of the dashi, Amane could also taste a faint<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sweetness. He wondered if that light undertone came from honey. There probably<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wasn't that much in the rolled omelets, but the satisfying hint of sweetness brought<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out a real depth.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had no real preference between sweet or salty when it came to egg dishes, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the ones he liked best combined the complex flavor of dashi with what he suspected<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was a bit of honey. Mahiru had accomplished that expertly, and Amane found himself<p></p>
        <p></p>
        quite impressed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Quietly muttering that the rolled omelets were delicious, Amane grabbed another one<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with his chopsticks and quickly tossed it in his mouth.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Not only had they been perfectly flavored, they'd been skillfully cooked as well. The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stock added to the eggs made them extra juicy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        These are definitely better than Mom's rolled omelets. He kept rude thoughts about his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nonpresent mother to himself as he smacked his lips happily. Then he realized that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was staring at him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You really seem to be enjoying it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Because it's all so good. I'm paying my respects to the delicious food."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sure, all right."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Besides, doesn't it feel better when I'm honest about how much I enjoy it rather than<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sitting here eating with a blank expression?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If you think something's delicious, you've got to really act like it, otherwise, the person<p></p>
        <p></p>
        who made it will be left wondering. Even if you say you enjoy it, who would believe you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        if you didn't look the part? It's better to be honest and just let how you feel show directly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on your face. Whether you're the one giving thanks or being thanked, it's best to do what<p></p>
        <p></p>
        feels good.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Yes, I suppose so…" Mahiru seemed to understand what Amane was saying, and she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smiled slightly. It was a gentle expression, and it betrayed just a hint of relief. It was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sweet enough that all of Amane's thoughts ground to a halt for a second.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Fujimiya?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah… no, it's nothing," Amane replied. He'd been enchanted by the angel's smile, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he couldn't possibly tell her that. To conceal his growing embarrassment, Amane took<p></p>
        <p></p>
        another bite of food, ending any further discussion.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Thank you for dinner."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm glad you liked it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had completely devoured every dish Mahiru had laid out. Mahiru's words had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been calm, but her expression was serene, and she seemed happy that Amane had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        packed everything into his stomach. Not a single grain of rice had been left behind.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It was delicious," Amane complimented.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I could tell that much just by watching you," Mahiru quipped dryly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Better than my mom's cooking."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I hear it's taboo to compare a girl's cooking to your mother's."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Isn't that only true when you're criticizing someone? Anyway, does that bother you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't mind, no."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well then, it's fine, right? It doesn't change the fact that it's delicious."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was clearly no amateur cook. Amane's mother probably had more years of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        experience under her belt, but she preferred different tastes, and many of her dishes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were fairly bland, so they were no match for Mahiru's carefully concocted foods.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Man, this is so awesome. To be able to eat like that every night!" exclaimed Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "As long as I don't have anything else going on, that is," Mahiru added.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…So I can really host you every night for dinner?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I wouldn't have suggested it if I was against the idea."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I guess that's true."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was a straight shooter, so of course she would've never agreed to it if she didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        want to in the first place. Amane still wasn't sure if it was okay to have her cooking for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him like this so often, however.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was paying for half the ingredients, plus a bit extra to cover her labor, but even so,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he couldn't help feeling like the burden on Mahiru was too large.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Do you normally cook for boys you don't even like?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm doing it because you were neglecting your health. Besides, I enjoy the act of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cooking itself, and I don't hate seeing you eat it with such gusto."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But…," Amane started.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If it bothers you that much, it would be no problem to stop."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, please, I'm begging you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At the first sign of Mahiru possibly not cooking for him anymore, Amane instantly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        retracted any and all complaints. That was just how much her food meant to him. To<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have it snatched away now—it would practically be a matter of life and death.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was entirely aware that Mahiru had gained full control of him by way of his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stomach, but Mahiru's cooking was just too delicious to refuse. Returning to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        convenience-store meals now would be like robbing the world of color.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shocked at Amane's immediate reply, Mahiru was stunned for a moment before<p></p>
        <p></p>
        breaking into a smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well then, please continue to enjoy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Okay."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It appeared that Amane's days of dining with the extremely charitable angel who made<p></p>
        <p></p>
        all the food by hand would continue for a while yet. Amane couldn't help but sigh from<p></p>
        <p></p>
        happiness, guilt, and anticipation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
