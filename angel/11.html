        angel couldn't do, though she did seem to be gradually improving, if ever so slowly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I can't win," Mahiru professed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Never mind clearing the stage—you haven't even defeated the first enemy," Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        observed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, shut up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, it's just a matter of practice; you gotta keep trying. Get that muscle memory."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane warned Mahiru that it would be a challenge, but she didn't seem ready to give<p></p>
        <p></p>
        up. It was charming to watch the girl tackle the game with such a serious expression.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane couldn't help but smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Unfortunately, Mahiru was just too much of a beginner and kept on losing. Eventually,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it was obvious that she was growing frustrated. As she shot a glance at Amane, he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        could have sworn he heard a gamelike sound effect accompany her sullen face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, here, you need to do it like this…" Mahiru was sure to lose interest if she continued<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to metaphorically bash her head against a wall, so Amane put his hand on the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        controller she was holding and tried to physically show her what to do.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had cleared this game on countless occasions, so he was able to help Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        get through tough spots. Surprisingly, Mahiru was actually worse than the average<p></p>
        <p></p>
        player. Most people wouldn't have gotten stuck nearly as many times as she did, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane kept that thought private.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Look, this enemy moves at a consistent speed in an irregular pattern, but if you watch<p></p>
        <p></p>
        here, he moves toward your character and speeds up as he approaches. Just watch<p></p>
        <p></p>
        your timing and jump."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane put his hand over Mahiru's smaller one and gripped the controller to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        manipulate the character on the TV, showing her how as he explained. On the screen,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the game character moved as Amane had said it would, avoiding the oncoming enemy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It wasn't much of a move, but it was apparently enough to impress Mahiru, who let out<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a small gasp of astonishment. Her eyes, rimmed with long lashes, snapped wide open,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and her expression brightened.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The two were sitting closer together than they ever had before, and Amane noticed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for the first time that Mahiru's lower lashes were fairly long, too. Smiling, he watched<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru happily play.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Amane admired her beautiful profile, Mahiru turned toward him, possibly because<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she'd felt his eyes on her. He'd needed to get close in order to be able to reach the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        controller, so the two had ended up far nearer to each other than either had expected.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Their arms and hands were even touching, and Amane could feel Mahiru's breath<p></p>
        <p></p>
        lightly grazing his skin. Amane found himself surrounded by warmth and a faint, sweet<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fragrance.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "S-sorry…" Amane suddenly realized that his hands were almost completely covering<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's, and he pulled away in a panic, while Mahiru's eyes darted around the room<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as if she had only just realized they were touching at all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Blinking dramatically, Mahiru replied, "No… it's fine. I'm the one who should apologize."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The girl's cheeks had flushed scarlet, and Amane was filled with regret over what he'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        done.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru wasn't a fan of physical contact. No matter how used to each other they had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gotten, having someone touch her hands like that had probably been too much for her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Thankfully, while she looked fairly embarrassed, she didn't appear upset or angry.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Really, I'm sorry," Amane said again.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Um, I'm not that bothered by it…," Mahiru said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't you hate physical contact?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I was surprised but not upset. It's not like you're a stranger."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It seemed that today, the magnanimous angel had seen fit to forgive Amane's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        transgression. Relieved at how easily Mahiru let it go, Amane restarted the game.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Fixing his eyes on the TV screen, Amane got ready to help Mahiru make some real<p></p>
        <p></p>
        progress in the game this time. Then he saw that her character had fallen off the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stage—a rather predictable outcome. Amane was seriously beginning to wonder if he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        could do anything to help her get better.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In the end, Mahiru somehow managed to clear one level, whining all the while. The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        two of them agreed that was probably a good stopping place for the time being.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If Amane kept making a total beginner face death, it would have a considerable effect<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on her motivation. His plan for now was to get her to try another game and loosen up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru, you're tilting."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        To that end, next Amane had suggested a racing game, since that had some grounding<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in the real world, but Mahiru was leaning with her entire body.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was no gyroscopic control element to the game, so there was absolutely no need<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to physically move around. Amane wasn't sure whether Mahiru even noticed what she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was doing, but she swayed left and right with every turn she made in the game.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In contrast to the earlier game, this one was all about driving a car, and Amane had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thought it'd be easier, since pretty much everyone understood the concept of driving<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to some degree. Playing through the tutorial also might've helped, because even<p></p>
        <p></p>
        though Mahiru's driving was a bit clumsy, she was able to handle the actual gameplay.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She was trying her absolute hardest to perform well. Her body swayed this way and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that while she maintained a very serious expression.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        This is ridiculously cute, Amane thought.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was strangely adorable, rocking back and forth like a pendulum. Her intense<p></p>
        <p></p>
        focus and effort only made her look even cuter.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With every turn, Mahiru's body automatically leaned way to the side. Eventually, she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tumbled right onto Amane's lap, and he was forced to choke down a laugh.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You really don't need to tilt your whole body, you know?" he said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I-it wasn't on purpose," Mahiru replied sheepishly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, I know. But still, you were leaning pretty far."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru sat back up, somehow keeping her trembling, pouty lips in check.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The girl had felt soft and light when she'd accidentally flopped on him. That much was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to be expected as Mahiru had a small build, but she was so slim that sometimes Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        worried she might snap in half.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Roused out of Amane's lap, Mahiru's cheeks were flushing, and her body was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        trembling, likely from embarrassment. It was times like these that the girl really<p></p>
        <p></p>
        resembled a small animal.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Finally, Amane couldn't stand it anymore, and he burst into a fit of laughter.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "A-are you making fun of me?" Mahiru demanded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, no. I was just thinking how charming you are."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So you are making fun of me!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You think I'd mock someone while they're trying their best?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "See? You were just very cute; that's all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…When you say cute, I'm sure you mean childish."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was a bit of a peevish overtone to Mahiru's words, and Amane was worried she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        might get depressed if he teased too much; thus he decided to keep any further<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thoughts to himself. He flashed Mahiru a half smile in response to her expression of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        disapproval, and she quickly turned away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Any trace of the angel's gloomy mood vanished instantly when she returned to the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        game. Her intense concentration overrode everything else on her face. It was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        becoming clear that she was getting used to the game, as she was managing to keep<p></p>
        <p></p>
        up with the other cars, if a little awkwardly. Amane had been right to assume a more<p></p>
        <p></p>
        familiar concept like steering a car was better for Mahiru. She did still veer off course<p></p>
        <p></p>
        into the dirt or slam into a wall a few times, though.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had been worried she might end up running the whole course backward, since<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she'd never played a game before, but he was relieved to see that she was making<p></p>
        <p></p>
        better progress than he'd expected.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Trying to play the racing game together with Mahiru proved to be a little difficult, as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she kept distracting Amane without realizing it. As she tilted her whole body back and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        forth with the game, she occasionally leaned right into him. Each time she did so, a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        lovely scent would waft over him, making it difficult to keep his composure.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even with the unusual handicap, Amane still managed to maintain a huge lead. They<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were competing against the weakest computer opponents, after all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…How are you so fast?" Mahiru inquired.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Practice and experience," Amane replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After playing the game so many times, Amane knew the course by heart and understood<p></p>
        <p></p>
        how to best navigate the turns. Even with Mahiru's outside interference, he was able<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to seize every advantage and hold the lead without much trouble.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Glancing back at Mahiru, who appeared utterly dumbstruck, Amane quietly switched<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the game to solo mode and dropped out of the competition. Mahiru didn't have enough<p></p>
        <p></p>
        experience, so Amane thought it'd be better to play together after he let her practice<p></p>
        <p></p>
        by herself for a while. It was better that she got comfortable playing against computer
        <p></p>
        controlled characters rather than feel disappointed over losing to Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Thankfully, it was clear that Mahiru had no shortage of determination, and she stared<p></p>
        <p></p>
        enthusiastically at the screen even after going to solo play. With an attitude like that,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was sure she would quickly learn to hold her own against a computer opponent.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was obvious what a hard worker she was, even with something like a video game.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Such perseverance was rather charming, but whenever Amane let a smile slip onto his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        face, Mahiru would quickly take notice and slap his knees in protest.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If he laughed too much, amused by her protests, Mahiru would frown and grumble,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane, you idiot."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I won."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After two hours of dogged perseverance, Mahiru crossed the finish line as the words<p></p>
        <p></p>
        FIRST PLACE flashed across the screen. She turned to look at Amane, obviously proud<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of herself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After a hard-won battle with the racing game, Mahiru had achieved the glory of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        finishing first.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Though she'd ended up in last place on so many earlier tries, Mahiru had refused to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        quit and kept going, improving her ranking bit by bit until at last, she won. Such<p></p>
        <p></p>
        investment had probably made the victory quite emotional.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's expression seemed to proclaim "I did it!" and Amane dutifully clapped in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        admiration.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's great. I could tell you really tried hard," he praised.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yep!" Perhaps because Mahiru was enjoying the praise, her usual demeanor had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        softened, and she appeared a little bashful. She didn't break into a huge, obvious grin<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but instead wore a fleeting, shy curl of the lips that looked ever-so-slightly pleased. It<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seemed so sweet that it was hard to believe it belonged to the same cool, reserved<p></p>
        <p></p>
        person.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Recently, Mahiru had been acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect<p></p>
        <p></p>
        young lady. Today most of all, she was really acting like a kid. Her cherubic smile had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something innocent about it, and looking at her, Amane felt his sense of reason begin<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to give way as the roaring desire to hold her close rose within him. The urge to pet<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru like a cat seized control of his arm, and before he knew it, Amane found himself<p></p>
        <p></p>
        reaching out toward her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is something the matter?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Quickly, Amane regained control of his wayward limb. "Ah, n-no, it's nothing. You really<p></p>
        <p></p>
        got good at this, h-huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm getting better?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "For sure. You're way better than when you first started."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thank you. It was a lot of fun, so I guess I got pretty engrossed." Mahiru chuckled to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        herself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane avoided making eye contact by crossing the room and retrieving a small box<p></p>
        <p></p>
        from a basket on the shelf. "Let's say this is your prize for first place," he said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, um, that's really not—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If you don't like the idea of a prize, then think of this as something left behind by a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stout old man with a white beard and a red suit."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was a Christmas present that Amane had carelessly forgotten to give Mahiru the day<p></p>
        <p></p>
        before.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Since Mahiru's birthday and Christmas weren't that far apart, Amane had expected<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some difficulty picking out this second gift. Thankfully, he'd also gotten a little more<p></p>
        <p></p>
        familiar with the practice, so it surprisingly wound up not being as tough to choose a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Christmas present as it had been finding one for Mahiru's birthday.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru blinked rapidly, as if the reference to a Christmas present had just reminded<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her that today was in fact Christmas, and she nervously accepted the box. At Amane's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        urging, she carefully undid the wrapping.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Well, it's nothing special, though, Amane thought.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She opened the box and slowly took out the gift. It was a leather key holder.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Expecting Mahiru to feel uncomfortable if Amane got her something too expensive,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had avoided getting a fancy brand-name item. He'd selected this one purely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        because the design seemed like it would suit Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was simple, with flowers and ivy carved into the leather, making it perfect for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        everyday use. Amane wasn't too well versed in flowers, so he didn't know exactly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        which ones were featured in the design, but he thought their dainty forms suited<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru well, and that's why he'd chosen it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I gave you my spare key and all. If you don't want to use it, that's okay, too,"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, I definitely will, thank you. You've got a better sense of style than I expected,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What do you mean, better than expected?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, normally you just wear sweatpants or jeans… It's not like you're into fashion<p></p>
        <p></p>
        or anything."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I just don't own anything besides functional clothes."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Getting dressed up in nicer outfits was a tedium that Amane avoided whenever<p></p>
        <p></p>
        possible. He'd never had the occasion to show Mahiru what he looked like in better<p></p>
        <p></p>
        clothing, so she'd only ever seen him in his school uniform and casual house clothes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was no wonder she assumed he had no fashion sense. Such a guess had been right<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on the money, and Amane didn't seem likely to dispel that slovenly impression<p></p>
        <p></p>
        anytime soon.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…If you made an effort, you'd probably look pretty good, you know? You kept up your<p></p>
        <p></p>
        appearance in middle school, didn't you?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That was because my mom forced me to… Wait, how do you know that?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shihoko sent me this picture and said, 'Here's what he could look like if he tried'…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Unbelievable."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was shocked to see the photo of the time his mother had dressed him up and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        brought him to work. Silently, Amane cursed his mother's indiscretion.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…That style didn't suit me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I suppose you're right, Amane. You know, you never make eye contact, and your face<p></p>
        <p></p>
        is always hidden behind your hair, but I think you have rather distinguished features…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's small hand stretched out toward Amane's face, and her white palm brushed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        against his forehead as she pushed his long bangs upward. She was looking at him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with a curious expression. He didn't think his face was anything to marvel over; it was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        perfectly ordinary—not quite ugly and not quite handsome. Amane began to wonder<p></p>
        <p></p>
        why Mahiru was staring so intently at him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…What is it?" he asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nothing. Your eyes look livelier than they used to, that's all," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Without looking away, Mahiru reminded Amane that several months earlier, his face<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had been vacant like a zombie's.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        While Mahiru continued to stare, Amane was beginning to feel uncomfortable that a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        girl, not to mention an incredible beauty, was staring at him so intently. He wondered<p></p>
        <p></p>
        what she found so fascinating about his boring looks.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Eventually, he couldn't stand it anymore. Amane slowly reached out and brushed a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        lock of hair away from Mahiru's own lovely face. He was hesitant to touch her, but she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had reached out and touched his hair so casually that he thought she'd probably<p></p>
        <p></p>
        forgive him for doing the same. It would only be the faintest moment of contact; surely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that much would be all right.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        But wow, she really is beautiful…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was much prettier than the glamorous models in the magazines that had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        previously been scattered around Amane's room—and much more appealing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Something about her felt amazing every time he looked upon her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Photographs, Amane knew, couldn't be trusted anyway. Even if they could capture a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        moment of beauty, preserving it in time, photographs could be made to deceive.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru, however, was standing there before him in the flesh. Her beauty was real—<p></p>
        <p></p>
        unadulterated. Amane didn't think he could ever get tired of beholding such a creature.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Amane continued studying her features, Mahiru's eyes started to shift, and she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pulled away from him, dropping her controller. Amane wondered what was bothering<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her as she hugged a nearby couch cushion tight against her chest.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Um. So… right. I have a Christmas present for you, too."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Um, oh, thanks."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was about to ask what on earth it might be, when Mahiru cut him off by pulling<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out a nicely decorated gift bag from her purse. Hastily, she pushed it into his hands.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, I'm going to prepare dinner."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh? Y-you are…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With those words, Mahiru quickly stood and moved to the kitchen. Amane was left<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with nothing but bewilderment at the overly rapid development.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After Amane finished washing the dishes from dinner, he returned to the living room<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to find that Mahiru was restless. She was sitting beside him, in the way they had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        recently grown accustomed to, but this time, Mahiru was having trouble maintaining<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her composure. She'd been averting her gaze all through dinner, too.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        This was a kind of self-consciousness that Mahiru had seemed previously incapable<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of, prompting Amane to wonder if something had happened. Perhaps it had something<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to do with her giving him the gift? When Amane had given Mahiru the teddy bear, he,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        too, had felt like running away, and it'd been difficult for him to calm down. Maybe<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was experiencing a similar sort of anxiety.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "By the way, can I open this?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "P-please do."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane picked up the gift from where he'd left it sitting atop the coffee table, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru nodded somewhat hesitantly. Concluding that she was indeed nervous about<p></p>
        <p></p>
        giving him a present, Amane untied the ribbon fastening the bag.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Right away, he could tell from the feel and weight that it was something made out of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cloth. When Amane pulled it out and saw it to be a length of black-and-white<p></p>
        <p></p>
        houndstooth, he wasn't sure what it was. After spreading out the whole object,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        however, he immediately understood.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "A scarf?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It appeared to be quite soft and luxurious. Surely, this would keep him warm if he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wound it around his neck.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Well, you're indifferent to fashion, and you always seem cold on the way to school,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I can really use it; and wow, it feels so nice."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Quality is important when you're choosing something that you'll be using every day,"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Mahiru was someone who only wore high-quality clothes, Amane was sure she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        knew what she was talking about. Mahiru seemed like the type who considered it a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        waste of time to buy cheap things, preferring to use well-made products that would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        last for a long time, instead. If this scarf met her standards, it had to be very nice<p></p>
        <p></p>
        indeed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could tell just by touching it that the scarf had a luxurious texture and was soft<p></p>
        <p></p>
        enough not to bother even sensitive skin.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Impressed with Mahiru's high standards, Amane waved the gift at her while she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        watched him with a stiff expression.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Can I try it on?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I gave it to you, so you can do whatever you like," Mahiru answered curtly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Roger."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane smiled at her blunt response and wrapped the scarf around himself. He could<p></p>
        <p></p>
        feel the quality of the fabric even more on his neck, where the skin was more sensitive.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It kept all the warmth in without letting too much air pass through. The feel of the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fabric was soothing and snug. As Amane was still inside, it was hard to tell just how<p></p>
        <p></p>
        effective the scarf would be, but he trusted it would undoubtedly keep him comfortable<p></p>
        <p></p>
        throughout the winter months.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Wow, it's super warm."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's great."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane put on a gentle smile, and Mahiru answered with a relieved smile of her own.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Recently, Mahiru had begun to show Amane her many kinds of smiles more frequently,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and he found himself staring again at her enchanting features.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …When she looks like that, she really does seem like an angel…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Sure, everyone at school said Mahiru looked heavenly, but Amane thought it was far<p></p>
        <p></p>
        more attractive when she smiled like this and showed her true self.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Wh-what is it?" Mahiru had noticed that Amane was staring straight at her. Her eyes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shifted left and right before fixing themselves back on the one gazing at her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nothing; I was just thinking that you seem much more relaxed compared to when I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        first met you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Is that so?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru looked surprised, and Amane laughed a little.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah. Before, you were all stuck-up and not cute at all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That was terrible of me, not being cute," Mahiru said sarcastically.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come on—don't sulk… Now you're way more… How should I put it? I think you just<p></p>
        <p></p>
        look better. I was thinking that the way you smile now is way cuter. It's really kind of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a shame you weren't smiling like that sooner."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had always been beautiful, but some quality of that changed in how she carried<p></p>
        <p></p>
        herself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The angelic smile that she showed at school had the beauty of something to be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        appreciated from a distance. It was a fragile thing that was not be touched.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The cold look that she'd first given Amane held the appeal of something wreathed in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thorns to keep humans from getting too close.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Now her soft and innocent smile had a welcoming warmth that made Amane want to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        caress and cherish her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane thought about how Mahiru had changed. She'd slowly gotten used to being<p></p>
        <p></p>
        around him, and she'd slowly opened up her heart. As he thought back on the time<p></p>
        <p></p>
        they'd spent together, Amane felt a ticklish sensation gradually rising through his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chest and up into his cheeks.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm happy that you can smile so naturally now, and that you've gotten used to hanging<p></p>
        <p></p>
        around with me, and… What are you doing?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's sentence was physically cut off as Mahiru lifted the scarf up from around his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        neck to cover his face with the fabric. She didn't wrap it tight, but it grew a bit stuffy<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and hot as the material trapped Amane's breath.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Please just be quiet for a bit," Mahiru commanded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What for?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Nothing."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane didn't understand this sudden outburst of eccentric behavior. He grabbed the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wrist of her hand that was holding up the scarf and pushed it back down. With his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        vision restored, he could see Mahiru's flaxen hair and the tinge of color spread across<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her cheeks, and he noticed that she was trembling slightly. As she looked at him, she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        grew even more flushed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He wondered why she was making such an odd face, and then it suddenly hit him that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        there could be only one answer.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Don't tell me… you're embarrassed?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shut up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru turned away sharply, which only served to confirm what Amane had said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Without meaning to, Amane smiled as he mused that the angel sure could be prickly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about things like this.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru groaned and quietly muttered, "I'm going outside for some air." Then she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        quickly made for the veranda.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Through the window, Amane could see it snowing just like it had the day before, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru didn't seem to care and stepped out onto the balcony anyway.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chilly air rushed into the apartment, and Amane shivered. Though Mahiru immediately<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shut the door, a touch of cold still hung about the living room. Amane let out a quiet<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sigh.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It's fine for her to run away to hide her embarrassment, but she could at least do it in a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slightly warmer outfit.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had obviously picked her clothes assuming she would be spending the day<p></p>
        <p></p>
        inside—or at least wearing a heavy jacket if she went out. She'd clearly prioritized<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looks over warmth, and her slender body was sure to chill quickly in the cold.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane cursed under his breath and picked up the blanket that was lying over the back<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of the sofa.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It's super dangerous to stand outside in the snow wearing such thin clothing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After pulling on his coat, Amane followed Mahiru out onto the veranda and wrapped<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the blanket around her shoulders.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Getting some fresh air is fine, but you'll catch a cold like that," chided Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru quickly turned to face him. "…Isn't that my line?" Clearly, she'd calmed down,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as she'd answered with her usual demeanor and expression, though there was a bit of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a sulking tone to her voice. Maybe she was feeling down because Amane had said<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something that called back to the conversation from when they'd first met.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmph. That only happened because I didn't get in a bath and warm up like I should<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have. Simple negligence," Amane reminded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Next time you get soaked like a drowned rat, make sure you warm yourself up right.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If I'm there, I'll be sure to toss you in the bath myself," Mahiru shot back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What're you, my mom?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There were definitely times when Mahiru said some rather motherly things.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With a smile, Amane recalled his first encounter with the angel. It'd been around the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        time autumn usually started getting cold, about halfway through October. He hadn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expected to come down with a fever just from getting a little wet, but the weather had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gotten chillier far faster than it usually did back in his hometown. Thinking back on it,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane admitted to himself that perhaps he really had been careless.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The most surprising part of the whole situation, however, had definitely been Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nursing him back to health.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Y'know, it's already been two months since we started talking…," Amane said<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wistfully.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're right. And to think, your room was so dirty! It was terrible… Now it only haunts<p></p>
        <p></p>
        my memories," Mahiru quipped.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, hush. I'm keeping it clean now, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And who do you owe for that?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Why, Lady Mahiru, of course. It makes me want to bow down in humble gratitude."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You don't need to do that, geez."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Back on that rainy day, Amane would never have believed that he and Mahiru would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        get to a point where they could banter like this. It all seemed so long ago now, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        really, it had only been a short while back. A lot had changed in those two months.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Time had really flown by.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A silence fell over the two, and suddenly, everything was quiet.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The snow, which had been starting and stopping in fits since yesterday, was now<p></p>
        <p></p>
        drifting softly down from the sky, painting the surrounding apartment buildings in a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pale hue.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane and Mahiru's building was in residential area, plus it was Christmas, so the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        area was hushed. From some apartment nearby, the pair could very faintly hear the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sounds of a Christmas song, though not well enough to decipher any lyrics.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru exhaled a little white puff, and Amane's ears caught that sound better than any<p></p>
        <p></p>
        other.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…It's kind of a strange feeling." Mahiru was the one to break the silence. "At first, I was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wondering 'What's up with this guy?'"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I guess that's not surprising. Anyone would be suspicious if someone suddenly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        forced an umbrella on them… What do you think now?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm, let's see. I'd have to say… you're a whole lot of work." Mahiru turned away after<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her ambiguous answer.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're not wrong." Amane smiled while leaning against the veranda railing. "…You<p></p>
        <p></p>
        know, I never thought that we would get close enough to be eating meals together like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        this, either. To be honest, I always thought of you as someone to be admired from a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        distance. I never considered ever getting involved with you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That was certainly honest… though I knew that already. That's precisely why I trust<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you," Mahiru said, and her body shook with laughter.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane knew that Mahiru only accepted him in her life because he wasn't attracted to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her; and apparently, she felt the same way.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Still, I'm glad that I got to know you like this. My life has really improved a ton, I'm<p></p>
        <p></p>
        happy because I get to eat delicious food every day, and I feel at ease when I'm hanging<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out with you," Amane declared.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You really think so?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I do. I'm incredibly grateful for these past two months. Thank you." Amane couldn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have been more sincere if he tried. It was thanks to Mahiru that his standard of living<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had gone up and that he got to enjoy a delicious meal every day. Surprisingly, Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had also discovered that he could enjoy talking to a girl without any sort of awkward<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expectations. It'd even become something he looked forward to. Even better, Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would occasionally flash him adorable reactions when Amane teased her, and he never<p></p>
        <p></p>
        got tired of those.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Recently, she's started to laugh more, too.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Amane had realized before, Mahiru had indeed started displaying a richer array of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        emotions, a change that only made her more endearing. Amane would never actually<p></p>
        <p></p>
        act on his feelings, of course, but… just looking at her made him feel at peace.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's eyes were wide, and Amane couldn't tell whether the slight redness in her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cheeks was because of the cold or because she was embarrassed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, thank you very much," she said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But I didn't do anything." From Amane's perspective, Mahiru was the one who'd done<p></p>
        <p></p>
        everything for him. He was sure he hadn't given the girl anything in return, but she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slowly shook her head in disagreement.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm grateful for things that you aren't aware of, Amane," Mahiru explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm… Each of us telling the other what we're thankful for has sort of an end-of-the
        <p></p>
        year vibe. I guess that's not all that weird, since the year is about to end."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Curiously, both Amane and Mahiru had thanked the other for certain things, despite<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the new year still being six days away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's eyes sparkled at the mention of the end of the year, and she let a little laugh<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slip out. "Ha-ha, that's right. It's still a little early, but… Happy New Year, Amane. Let's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        make it a good one."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Yeah, Happy New Year." Amane nodded and smiled at Mahiru's heaven-sent proposal.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Then Mahiru suddenly said, "I'm freezing; let's go on inside, shall we?" She turned<p></p>
        <p></p>
        around and opened the glass door that led back to Amane's living room.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane caught a glimpse of her ears, which had turned bright red in the frosty air, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he agreed that it was best to retreat inside so as not to catch cold.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …One way or another, I guess I've also taken a liking to this lifestyle. That's probably why<p></p>
        <p></p>
        my chest feels so warm. As he followed Mahiru back into the apartment, Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        watched the gentle swaying of her soft, flaxen hair and smiled secretly to himself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He hoped that in the days to come, he would continue to see more of the angel who<p></p>
        <p></p>
        lived next door.<p></p>
        <p></p>

        15 A Power Outage, Anxiety, and Warmth<p></p>
        "Ah!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hadn't expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to the television. It was a total blackout.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn't suffered any damage, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he would have to check the other appliances later.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Do you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        However, there was no reply.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Mahiru?" he called out anxiously.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        arm… It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling<p></p>
        <p></p>
        voice come from the floor.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What a disgrace…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Um, sorry I startled you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…No. I startled myself; that's all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru didn't seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped<p></p>
        <p></p>
        around and found her original position.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn't seem to be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane's shirt<p></p>
        <p></p>
        again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling<p></p>
        <p></p>
        again. This time, she didn't fall off the sofa.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Looking for something?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Are you being sarcastic?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Why in the world would I be?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not that much of an ass."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily—but she was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the hem of Amane's shirt, but she didn't make any moves to brush off his hand. He had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…So I guess you're not a big fan of the dark?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I don't hate it, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm-hmm?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I just don't like it when it's bright one moment and dark the next—that's all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, okay."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not really afraid of the dark, and I don't feel scared."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sure, yeah."<p></p>
        <p></p>
