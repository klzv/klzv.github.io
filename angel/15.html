        "In what sense? I really don't think I resemble him that much, either physically or with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        my personality."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You're exactly like him. Truly."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru sighed more heavily this time, and Amane rubbed her head again. She still<p></p>
        <p></p>
        didn't seem to be against it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …Do I really resemble him that much?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Sure, they had once or twice been mistaken for brothers far apart in age, but Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        felt like he had a completely different energy from his father. Their personalities, too,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        while not exact opposites, nevertheless were quite different.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        What could she have meant by saying that he was just like his father, despite such clear<p></p>
        <p></p>
        differences?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Any number of doubts welled up in Amane's mind, but Mahiru must not have intended<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to say anything further. Her eyes narrowed a bit, and she left the matter alone.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After stroking her hair a bit more, Amane pulled back, and Mahiru seemed to suddenly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        snap back to her senses. She peered up at Amane, slightly flustered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What, you wanted me to keep going?" he asked teasingly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru flushed red again. "Please don't mock me," she said quietly, so he decided to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        call it a day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, she was in a bad mood now, for she made no attempt to hide the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        displeasure on her face as she opened the door to her own apartment and slipped<p></p>
        <p></p>
        inside.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        For a brief moment, Amane regretted his actions, wondering if he had overdone it a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        little, when Mahiru cracked her door open and peeked out at him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her cheeks were still pink, and her voice sounded peevish but with a slight fawning<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tone to it somehow.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You're a dummy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Just as suddenly, Mahiru shut the door.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …Well, that makes two of us, I guess.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Wasn't it Mahiru's fault that his heart was suddenly leaping in his chest?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane sighed quietly, then leaned against the wall of the unheated corridor, trying to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        let the sudden burning in his chest cool a bit. That was the moment he noticed he could<p></p>
        <p></p>
        see his breath in the frosty air.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A short while after Amane had said goodnight to Mahiru and returned to his apartment,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his parents finished their bath. When Amane looked up from the TV toward the sound<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of approaching slippers, he saw them standing there in their nightclothes, casually<p></p>
        <p></p>
        holding hands.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Well, I guess that comes naturally if you've already taken a bath together.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "We've had our bath, Amane. It's your turn."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sure… Wait, how did you two manage to both fit in my tub? It's only big enough for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        one."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        For someone living alone, this was quite a spacious, well-designed apartment, but that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        didn't mean the bathtub was especially large. It certainly wasn't big enough for a
        <p></p>
        full-grown man and woman to sit together comfortably.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh no, it's fine! There's no problem if you get in close together. Right, Shuuto dear?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His mother smiled and drew closer to her husband, and his father nodded in agreement<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with a gentle smile. They had already been married for nearly twenty years, but the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        two of them still acted like newlyweds. Amane could do nothing but smile bitterly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "As loving as always, I see."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Are you jealous?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Not really. I can relax better in the bath alone anyway."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What about Mahiru…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, listen up. Nothing is going on with her."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He didn't understand why his mother wanted so badly to hook him up with Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Well, it wasn't a total mystery, since she'd been joking about wanting Mahiru for a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        daughter-in-law since the day they'd met, but Amane was certain his mother had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mistaken the trust that Mahiru had in Amane for romantic affection.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is that so?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Now, now, Shihoko. Amane's at a delicate age, so let's be considerate."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But I'm being serious…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Whatever you say, Mom."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane paid his mother's words no mind as he stood up to get ready for his bath, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he stopped when his father called his name.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane." He used a serious tone, not the voice he used to chide his wife or the one that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he had when he smiled. When Amane looked at him, wondering what was the matter,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he was met with a soft but firm gaze.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane, are you glad you moved here?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Though he was caught by surprise, after a moment Amane quickly met his father's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        steady gaze with an easy smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Yeah, I am. Life got easier."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Surely his parents must have been worried about him. Worried enough to frequently<p></p>
        <p></p>
        come check on how he was doing and worried enough to try to see him at every<p></p>
        <p></p>
        opportunity.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        All of it had been in order to make sure that Amane was living comfortably.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is that so? I'm glad."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You don't need to worry; there's someone here who I can really rely on."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Unlike before—<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He swallowed those words and kept his answer simple and clean.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His mother smiled brightly. "Oh, you must mean little Itsuki! I've never met him in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        person, so I wanted to go say hello, since we came all this way."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Give it a rest, please; you're going to start something weird."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's not weird at all. I'll tell him how cute you were when you were little, and…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "See, that's exactly what I'm talking about. Seriously, just stop…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If this spilled over to Itsuki, then it was certain to reach Chitose as well. That was the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        one thing Amane wanted to avoid no matter what. He did not want to deal with her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        endless teasing or put up with her badgering him for old photos from his past.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had looked remarkably like a cute little girl when he was small, and it didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        help that his mother sometimes even dressed him up in girls' clothes. If photographic<p></p>
        <p></p>
        evidence of that got out, his life would be nothing but suffering.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But I can't help wanting to say hello, can I? He's such good friends with you, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's true, but—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I bet he's a really good boy, isn't he? He's got the Amane seal of approval, after all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…He's a good guy. So good that he's wasted on me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It wasn't something he would ever say to Itsuki's face, but Amane always appreciated<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his friend who once took the initiative to call out in a friendly voice to a very gloomy<p></p>
        <p></p>
        boy who never interacted with anyone and just sat quietly on the side of the classroom<p></p>
        <p></p>
        listening to music.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm going to take a bath."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He felt embarrassed after openly praising Itsuki, even though he wasn't there, and to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        disguise his discomfort, he quickly headed for his bedroom to retrieve a change of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        clothes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He could hear a small chuckle behind his back, compelling Amane to escape to his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        room, scowling and muttering the whole way.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The following morning, when Amane went out into the living room after waking up<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and dressing, he found his parents already up and food on the table.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Good morning. Breakfast is ready, so have a seat."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane sat down at the table, smiling slightly at his father, who called to him from the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        kitchen, wearing Amane's apron, which had been draped over a chair.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had only just arrived in this apartment and had already made himself comfortable<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in an unfamiliar kitchen, probably because he was so used to doing the cooking. At<p></p>
        <p></p>
        home, Amane's parents took turns preparing meals, so Amane was also used to seeing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his father in an apron, and there was nothing unusual about it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's mother was already waiting impatiently at the table. She probably wanted to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        help, but his father had likely insisted that she leave it to him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane also considered helping and got as far as standing up from his seat only to see<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his father bring out steaming hot rice and miso soup on a tray, immediately taking the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wind out of Amane's sails.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thanks, Dad."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't mention it. Anyway, Miss Shiina was kind enough to pack yesterday's leftovers<p></p>
        <p></p>
        into containers, so I just heated that up, cooked some rice, then made miso soup and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        rolled omelets."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Eat a proper breakfast was practically a motto in the Fujimiya household, so they never<p></p>
        <p></p>
        skipped their morning meal.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's father had happily incorporated the leftovers into the menu, but if they hadn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had them, there was little doubt he would have whipped up something.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With a smile, Shuuto placed the rice and miso soup in front of each of them.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's attention was drawn to his father's rolled omelets, which he hadn't tasted in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a while, and before he knew it, the table was set, and his father had taken his own seat.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, let's get to it, shall we?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Certainly. Thank you, dear."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thanks for the meal."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Everyone expressed their gratitude, and then Amane reached with his chopsticks for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the rolled omelets in front of him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        This was the first time Amane had eaten his father's cooking since he went home for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        summer break, so he was looking forward to the nostalgia of it as he took his first bite<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and slowly chewed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The flavor of the dashi, the hint of sweetness, the slightly undercooked egg—it tasted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like home—yet at the same time, Amane found something slightly lacking.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is something the matter?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His father seemed to have noticed Amane chewing with a serious expression and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sounded concerned.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm… no, it's nothing."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Did I maybe mess up the seasonings?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "N-no, that's not it; it's good, but… I was just thinking that the flavor is different from<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the way that Mahiru always makes omelets."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, so that's it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He hadn't eaten his father's cooking for almost half a year, so even though it should<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have been familiar, he was actually more accustomed to Mahiru's cooking after eating<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it every day. Even Amane was surprised.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Of course, that wasn't to say that his father's cooking was bad or anything, just that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's seasonings were more to Amane's tastes. But even so, he felt somewhat
        <p></p>
        self-conscious about the fact that his tongue had adapted so well to Mahiru's cooking,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        when he had only met her a few months earlier.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You've really fallen for Miss Shiina, haven't you?" his father asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "For her cooking, yeah."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, now," his mother crowed. "Are you saying you're not interested in Mahiru herself,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        then?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No one is saying that, and I do not intend to fall for such a leading question."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was not about to let his mother steer the conversation in that direction again.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shihoko frowned—obviously, her aim had been exactly as Amane expected. Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        snorted through his nose and refused to take the bait.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His parents departed before lunch.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Both of them apparently had work the next day, so Amane had suggested that it would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        be hard on them if they didn't get home early and rest. They had a long drive ahead of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        them, which would of course be exhausting, so it was better if they hurried up and got<p></p>
        <p></p>
        going.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But I wanted to talk more with my dear Mahiru and meet Itsuki…," his mother<p></p>
        <p></p>
        muttered quietly after stepping out the door into the building's hallway.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Then do that stuff next time… Besides, you'll have to make an appointment to see<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki. He doesn't have a lot of free time."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, you set it up for me then, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If I feel like it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was obvious to everyone that Amane had no intention of doing anything of the sort.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His mother grew sullen, but Amane's father soothed her—and more or less restored<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her good spirits.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Amane was watching his parents, the door to the next-door apartment quietly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        creaked open. From the narrow crack, he could see a flash of golden hair and Mahiru's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        face peeking out.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She must have come out because she had heard his mother talking. For better or<p></p>
        <p></p>
        worse, his mother's voice traveled quite well.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, perfect, I was just thinking about coming to say good-bye!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Both of Amane's parents noticed Mahiru and moved over to stand in front of her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apartment as she slipped on a pair of shoes and stepped out into the hallway. Amane's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mother was wearing a big smile and seemed determined to get as close to Mahiru as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        possible. Mahiru shrunk back but didn't retreat entirely.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Are you two leaving already?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I wish we weren't. Really, we'd like to stay another day or two, but we have work."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Things would be different if we had come up a little bit earlier, but… this is all the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        time we have."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru smiled placidly at Amane's parents.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, there's always next time," his mother said. "Although, next time it's Amane's turn<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to come to us."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, yeah. I'll be home for summer vacation."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could feel his mother's gaze bearing down on him. He knew right away she was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hoping that he would bring Mahiru along with him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Still, he couldn't help but wonder if that might be a good idea. She apparently spent<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her school breaks alone, after all. Maybe she wouldn't be so opposed to the idea, he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thought idly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You really have no charm at all, Amane," his mother said. "Isn't that right, Mahiru?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh, I… I'm not sure how to—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come now, Shihoko, don't put her on the spot," Amane's father chided. "…Though, it's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        true that Amane has gotten less up front about various things as he's gotten older,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hasn't he?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had no allies here, so he silently pretended to ignore his parents. Shuuto<p></p>
        <p></p>
        turned to Mahiru with a gentle smile that was different than Shihoko's.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "As you can see, our Amane has a hard time expressing his feelings, but if you look<p></p>
        <p></p>
        closely, you can tell that he's a kindhearted young man. I would be very happy if you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would continue to be a good friend to him."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ugh, I'm right here, you know. This is so embarrassing…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His father had praised him, but Amane felt more like he had been goaded by an enemy<p></p>
        <p></p>
        than supported by an ally.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He certainly didn't think of himself as a particularly kindhearted person. He just<p></p>
        <p></p>
        showed the people close to him the respect and affection he thought they deserved. It<p></p>
        <p></p>
        felt wrong to have that confused with kindness.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Awkwardly trying to find anywhere else to look, Amane glanced over at Mahiru and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        saw her blink quickly and smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I've always thought that Amane is an honest and kind person. So much so that I'm<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the one who should be asking for his continued friendship."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, that's wonderful. That puts my mind at ease."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wanted to make a quip about his father's mind being at ease, but he was so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shaken by what Mahiru had said that he couldn't think of anything. It was so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        embarrassing to hear her describe him that way. He couldn't even look at her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His mother laughed as she watched him squirm, but Amane couldn't even respond. He<p></p>
        <p></p>
        could only bite his lip in tortured silence.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You don't really need to flatter me, you know."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After Amane's parents had finally departed, he spoke to Mahiru in a quiet voice as they<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stood alone in the hallway.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had made that remark to relieve the awkward atmosphere somewhat, but for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some reason, Mahiru raised her eyebrows and stared at him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her expression was calm, but there was a subtle edge to it that he found intimidating.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Do I seem like the type to say empty words I don't mean?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, you wouldn't lie to me—but maybe in front of my parents?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She seemed to object to him calling it flattery.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru huffed and then let out a sigh of exasperation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Now see here, I trust you because I think you have a good heart, and I really do like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        spending time with you. I promise: I was not trying to flatter you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "O-oh…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane felt the heat rushing to his face. Hearing her talk so candidly was terribly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        embarrassing. Fortunately, Mahiru did not seem to notice his unease, and he nodded<p></p>
        <p></p>
        meekly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru seemed satisfied. "As long as you understand. Well, I suppose I'll get started on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        lunch."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, Mahiru was going to fix him lunch today, just as she had done every day of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the New Year's holiday. Feeling a mixture of gratitude and shame, Amane looked down<p></p>
        <p></p>
        at Mahiru's golden hair as she placed a hand on the door to his apartment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Someone she can trust, huh…? That's what I was gonna say.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru ignored the fact that Amane thought she was an angel. To her, he was an<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ordinary neighbor. But she trusted him. That was what he was most grateful for.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm so glad I moved here."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru must have heard his quiet mumbling, because she turned around and asked,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Did you say something?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, nothing," Amane said quickly, following her into his apartment.<p></p>
        <p></p>

        19 A New Semester<p></p>
        A new school semester had started, but not much had changed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Everyone seemed to have spent the winter vacation relaxing, so there weren't any<p></p>
        <p></p>
        major developments the way summer vacation could sometimes bring. The usual cast<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of characters was back, and no one had undergone a drastic image change or anything.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was seated at his desk, quietly gazing at a classroom that was somewhat more<p></p>
        <p></p>
        boisterous than usual, when a shadow loomed over him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yo, Amane, what's good."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thanks, can't complain."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was Itsuki, who had entered the classroom from behind Amane's seat. Itsuki was no<p></p>
        <p></p>
        exception and had also remained the same.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane hadn't seen him since Christmas, but he was wearing the same flippant smile<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as always.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So did you have a good holiday?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…P-pretty much, yeah."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "C'mon, you're holding something back. Was there some kind of… progress?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What? Look, it's not like that. And just so you know, nothing happened."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That wasn't actually true, of course. But Amane wouldn't dream of telling Itsuki that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had stayed over at his place, even if it had been an accident.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He knew the moment he told Itsuki, Itsuki was guaranteed to tell Chitose, and it wasn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hard to imagine that the two of them would start teasing and poking fun at him first<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chance they got.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Aside from that incident, all that had happened over the break was his parents coming<p></p>
        <p></p>
        over and their communal visit to the shrine, which surely fell into the category of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nothing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Hmm?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I didn't really do anything."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane found Itsuki's rather triumphant smile pretty irritating but decided that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        responding would just encourage him, so he let it go.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He looked around the classroom, hunting for some topic that would let him change<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the subject… but nothing was particularly new or notable.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As always, the girls were standing around Yuuta Kadowaki, the so-called prince of their<p></p>
        <p></p>
        grade. As always, the boys in the room were openly jealous, even though Yuuta himself<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wore a slightly troubled expression.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That dynamic hasn't changed one bit," Amane remarked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, good ol' Yuuta. Same old spectacle, huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In the end, Amane, who considered it none of his business, and Itsuki, who had a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        girlfriend and wasn't interested in other girls, smiled wryly at Yuuta's popularity and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        continued scanning their familiar surroundings.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come to think of it, I heard that Shiina might have a boyfriend, you know."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A group of several girls formed nearby, and Amane could hear what they were talking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about. He suddenly stiffened.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, Risa told me, yeah. She went on a shrine visit and saw her holding hands with a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        boy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, I heard! Shiina has never been swayed by anyone before, but maybe that was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        because she had a boyfriend?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sounds like he was a really cool-looking guy, but Risa said she's never seen him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        before. He must be from another school."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Somehow, it felt like the attention of the whole classroom shifted to the girls'<p></p>
        <p></p>
        conversation. Even Yuuta seemed to be looking over and perking up his ears.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Only Itsuki was looking at Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I know nothing."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I didn't even ask you anything yet."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not involved."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sure."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki smiled knowingly at Amane, who had shut him down in a quiet voice, then<p></p>
        <p></p>
        flicked Amane's bangs up and out of the way.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Say, you always hide your face, but it's not too shabby."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I can't take that as anything but mockery when you say it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki could be a real prankster, and he never seemed to take much of anything<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seriously, and he was definitely a good-looking guy himself, so when he told Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that he had an attractive face, it sounded decidedly sarcastic.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane knew he was an average-looking guy at best, and it made him uncomfortable<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to hear other people talking about his appearance.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He slapped Itsuki's hand away from his bangs and scowled, but his friend only grinned.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's just the sort of guy you are."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shut up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, can't say it's out of character."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was still acting cold, and Itsuki grinned at him without even a hint of anger.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "There's a rumor going around school."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They were still seated across from each other at the dining table after dinner when he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shared the news, and Mahiru's face stiffened, as if she already knew exactly what he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was talking about.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was sure to have the most trouble from the situation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As far as Amane could tell from what he'd heard, he had yet to be identified as the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mystery man, but even so, it must have been exhausting, having everyone suddenly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        asking her about having a boyfriend.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That must have been why Mahiru was moving stiffly and stepping just a little wearily<p></p>
        <p></p>
        when she came over to Amane's apartment that day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…It's all right, because no one knows that it was you, Amane, but everyone's really<p></p>
        <p></p>
        taken it the wrong way. This is going to be a difficult misunderstanding to clear up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is holding your hand enough to turn someone into your boyfriend?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't know. For the time being, I've been strongly denying everything, telling people<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that the boy was just an acquaintance. Now we have to wait for the rumor to die down."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm, well, I guess there's nothing else we can do, huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Obviously, people would think less of Mahiru if they thought that she was dating a guy<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like Amane, so he hoped that the rumors would burn out quickly. She was clearly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stressed, having person after person question her about a maybe-boyfriend.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At the same time, Amane felt an uneasy tinge of regret and embarrassment whenever<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he heard the rumors circulating, so he also wanted to put the whole thing behind them.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane sighed heavily, while Mahiru just quietly cast her eyes downward.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Did we really look that much like sweethearts?" Mahiru suddenly asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I wonder. To be honest, I can't really see you ever going out with a guy like me. You'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        definitely go for a smarter, more attractive guy, so I think even if I saw us standing side<p></p>
        <p></p>
        by side, I'd assume we were simply acquaintances rather than boyfriend and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        girlfriend."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's not true."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had answered him in a stronger voice than expected. When he turned to look<p></p>
        <p></p>
        at her again, she was not wearing the worried face she'd been making earlier. Instead,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for some reason, Mahiru seemed a little… angry. She had a determined look about her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane, your assessment of yourself is quite low, but it's not accurate. I think that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you're a very well-balanced person. You're kind and considerate and gentlemanly, so I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        think you've got a very good personality. And when you got all dressed up, I think you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looked really nice, too."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her words were far too kind. Amane could scarcely believe that she was talking about<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him. His face began to turn bright red. He never would have imagined that Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thought so highly of him, and she was saying these things so earnestly that it made<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him feel awkward to be on the receiving end of her praise.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, he was not the only one feeling a bit awkward. Midway through, Mahiru's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        voice had begun to tremble, but she still looked Amane directly in the eye, making sure<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that he fully understood that this was her honest opinion. Of course, that didn't make<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it any less embarrassing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh r-really…? Um, o-okay, thanks."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "S-so, um, well… don't put yourself down so much."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Y-yeah…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane didn't feel any urge to argue with her. It was obvious that she wouldn't hear it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's cheeks were tinged with red as she squirmed and shifted, looking at the floor.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane groaned. He wasn't sure what to do, either. Anything had to be better than<p></p>
        <p></p>
        doing nothing while the frustration and humiliation kept bubbling up inside him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Uh, I'm gonna go wash the dishes."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "O-okay."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At the moment, a tactical retreat seemed like the best play. Avoid and escape. Staying<p></p>
        <p></p>
        here to watch Mahiru tremble in shame was bad for his heart.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As he took two deep breaths and then stood up from the table and gathered the dishes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and carried them to the sink, Mahiru sank into the living room sofa and buried her face<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in a cushion. She was acting as if she was the one in anguish over getting unexpected<p></p>
        <p></p>
        compliments.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If you're that embarrassed," Amane grumbled to himself, "maybe you shouldn't have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        said anything." But he felt as if a slight weight had been lifted off his chest by Mahiru's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        words. The whole thing had been heart-wrenching, for sure, but also a bit of a relief.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even though it was winter, Amane decided to wash the dishes with cold water. He<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hoped the icy shock would help clear his mind.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, hey, Amane? Can I borrow the angel?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The phone call from Chitose came in the evening, three days after the new semester<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had started.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Normally, they would talk through a messaging app, but for some unknown reason,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she actually called him. And she was asking about Mahiru. Amane was really confused.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose asked to borrow Mahiru, but Mahiru's not mine to lend out, so if Chitose wants<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some of her time, she had better ask her herself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't ask me. Ask her."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is she there with you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…She is, but—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, ask her if she wants to hang out together tomorrow after school."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ask her yourself!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He briefly wondered if she didn't have Mahiru's contact information, but then he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        remembered at Christmastime when Chitose had been so busy messing with Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that she had completely forgotten to exchange numbers with the girl.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        So she must have decided that the best way to get to Mahiru was through Amane, who<p></p>
        <p></p>
        definitely had Mahiru's contact information and could often be found right beside her,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        too. He could understand the thought process, but he wanted to tell her that he wasn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a carrier pigeon, delivering messages back and forth like it was his job.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        For the time being, he decided that she had better talk to Mahiru directly, so he handed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the phone over to Mahiru, who was sitting next to him looking confused, and told her,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Chitose wants to talk to you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru looked perplexed but dutifully took the smartphone and held it up to her ear<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as Amane leaned back in his seat.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru here… Huh, tomorrow? S-sure, I don't have any particular plans, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane smiled mischievously as he watched Mahiru's troubled expression.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I bet Chitose's putting the pressure on her by talking a mile a minute like always.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru didn't look upset or anything. She just seemed earnestly surprised by the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sudden proposal and unsure how to handle it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She was shooting glances over at Amane, so he told her, "I'll leave it up to your<p></p>
        <p></p>
        judgment. She wants to hang out with you, not me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even Mahiru hung out with friends sometimes, but she preferred to come home after<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a few hours and spend her time in the kitchen.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane thought that she could do with an excuse to go relax a bit, though he wasn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        entirely sure that hanging out with Chitose really lent itself to relaxation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "S-sure… Um, in that case, I think I'll accept your invitation, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Perhaps Amane's assurance had been the deciding factor. When she told Chitose as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        much, the happy "Yay!!" from the other end of the phone line was clearly audible, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru reflexively pulled the phone away from her ear.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane caught Mahiru's eye and gave her a knowing smile. Chitose could be… a lot to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        handle. Mahiru also smiled, looking a bit nervous but also relieved and even happy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Chitose finally settled down, Mahiru returned the phone to her ear. Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        watched them chat for another moment or two before Mahiru eventually hung up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thank you very much," she said politely. "Here's your phone back."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Their conversation had apparently reached a resolution, and tomorrow she would be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        joining Chitose on some excursion.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, that was sudden. Then again, that's how Chitose always operates."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "W-well, I certainly was surprised."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "She's not a bad person. She can just be a little forceful."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane knew that was quite the understatement. Chitose usually meant well, but she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        could definitely be pushy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru wore a troubled smile, as if she already knew that, but she didn't seem upset,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so that was good, Amane thought. He'd always found it a little sad how few people got<p></p>
        <p></p>
        along with their buddies' girlfriends.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Go have fun tomorrow; don't worry about me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Oh, that's right—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was one thing that Amane had to warn her about.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If she starts harassing you or makes you uncomfortable, feel free to give her a smack.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        You don't have to hold back. That girl is exactly like my mom—she loves cute things,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so she's almost certainly going to get handsy with a beauty like you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had managed to keep Chitose in check before, but now he was a little worried<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to be sending Mahiru off alone with her. Mahiru was undeniably beautiful—she turned<p></p>
        <p></p>
        heads wherever she went. He knew she had to be careful about getting hit on by<p></p>
        <p></p>
        strangers, but Chitose was another matter. Yes, he had relied on Chitose's keen insight<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on the occasion of Mahiru's birthday, but he also knew that when it came to cute<p></p>
        <p></p>
        things, the girl just couldn't help herself. Amane felt it was necessary to at least warn<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru about Chitose's wandering hands.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Now, I don't think she's going to bother you too much, but if you only give her a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        halfhearted rejection, she's bound to get excited and pounce you, so be careful." Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        noticed that Mahiru's lips were pressed tightly together so he cocked his head<p></p>
        <p></p>
        quizzically and asked, "Hey, what's up?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Nothing at all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru quietly averted her eyes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        On the day that Mahiru was supposed to hang out with Chitose, Amane hurried home<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and spent some quiet time alone for the first time in a while.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Recently, he and Mahiru had been spending pretty much every day together, especially<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with her making his lunch sometimes, so this was almost like a holiday for Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Of course, he was happy that they were together so often… but sometimes it was nice<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to have space to himself like this, too.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The seat beside him felt a little cold, though.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Man, I really got used to having Mahiru around, huh?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Only a few months had passed since they'd first met, and he was already taking her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        presence for granted. Amane felt like they'd gotten very close, more like two people<p></p>
        <p></p>
        who'd known each other for years, rather than months. He figured that they must be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        quite compatible.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Personally, Amane really liked where they were in their relationship—they were close<p></p>
        <p></p>
        enough to enjoy the time they spent together without stepping on each other's toes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The only problem was, he liked it so much that he didn't want to let go.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Man, I'm simpleminded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wasn't the kind of guy to come out and passionately declare his love, but he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        couldn't deny that his feelings for Mahiru went far beyond those of a neighbor and a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        friend. At the same time, he refused to allow himself to develop any serious romantic<p></p>
        <p></p>
        interest in her. If he let the scales tip any further, he didn't think he would be able to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        see Mahiru as a friend anymore. Amane was aware of the tension in his heart, and it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        made him deeply uneasy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That's why he took his romantic feelings and stuffed them deep down in his gut where<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nobody would see them.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru would only be troubled by his affection, he knew. She cared about him in her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        own way, but it was obvious that she was not in love with him or anything like that.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was no way that she would ever fall for a loser like him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Sure, she sometimes said nice things about him, but that didn't mean she thought<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about him that way, and if he tried to complicate their relationship by taking it in a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        direction that she didn't like, it would only make things awkward.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane turned to look out the window, hoping to get away from the squirming<p></p>
        <p></p>
        uneasiness in his chest.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was winter, so the days ended early, and a curtain of utter darkness had fallen over<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the sky. It was just past six o'clock, but it already seemed late at night.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was with Chitose, so she wasn't going to be out too late, but even so, he felt a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        little anxious at the idea of two good-looking high school girls walking around alone<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in this darkness.<p></p>
