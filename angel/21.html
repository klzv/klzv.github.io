        tables on him. It was true, he had watched Mahiru sleep several times before—and<p></p>
        had gone as far as to touch her face once—so he really didn't have much room to<p></p>
        complain.<p></p>
        "I let you see me with my guard down, so I thought it was time to even the score."<p></p>
        "But you fell asleep all on your own… so… mghnhgh…"<p></p>
        "Oh, so you're talking back to me now?"<p></p>
        She gently pinched both his cheeks.<p></p>
        "Showwy…," Amane meekly apologized, still struggling to talk properly.<p></p>
        "Very well. Good grief."<p></p>
        Apparently satisfied with Amane's apology, Mahiru stopped tugging at his cheeks and<p></p>
        started poking at them instead. In the end, it didn't change the fact that she was<p></p>
        touching his face, but Amane had also pinched her, so this was his just deserts.<p></p>
        His cheeks were less pliable and stretchy than Mahiru's, so he didn't see how pinching<p></p>
        them could be all that much fun. Still, Mahiru kept it up with a happy smile, slowing<p></p>
        tracing a finger down his cheek.<p></p>
        "You look much better now."<p></p>
        "Did I really look that worn out earlier?"<p></p>
        "Not exactly. But I see you every day, so I can tell. I mean, you notice whenever I'm<p></p>
        having a hard time, right, Amane?"<p></p>
        "Guess that's true."<p></p>
        "It's that sort of thing."<p></p>
        Mahiru made this declaration with a blank expression, then traced over Amane's<p></p>
        cheek again and smiled impishly.<p></p>
        "Whenever things get tough, I want you to lean on me, okay? Just like you let me lean<p></p>
        on you."<p></p>
        "…I'll try."<p></p>
        Suddenly, Mahiru pinched him again, gripping his cheeks between her thumbs and<p></p>
        two fingers.<p></p>
        Hoping to save his poor face from further pinch-related damage, he replied in a panic,<p></p>
        "F-fine, I understand!"<p></p>
        Mahiru nodded in satisfaction. "Good."<p></p>
        "…This is coercion, you know."<p></p>
        "Women can be forceful when we need to be. Besides, I never let anyone other than<p></p>
        you see me behave this way, so there's no problem, really."<p></p>
        "Uh, there's plenty of problems."<p></p>
        If anything, that's scarier.<p></p>
        Mahiru had also just admitted that she gave Amane special treatment. But she didn't<p></p>
        seem particularly concerned about the implications of what she just said and simply<p></p>
        smiled when she saw Amane's obvious embarrassment.<p></p>
        "You dummy," Amane muttered, turning away in a weak attempt to hide his chagrin.<p></p>
        Chapter 28: Contact with the Prince<p></p>
        Even though he and Mahiru now had class together, Amane's daily life had hardly<p></p>
        changed at all. He diligently attended school like a good student, ate lunch with Itsuki<p></p>
        in the cafeteria, and went home afterward because he wasn't in a club. He almost never<p></p>
        interacted with Mahiru. Everything was as it should be.<p></p>
        One thing that had changed a little bit was that he'd started talking with Yuuta more<p></p>
        than during their first year.<p></p>
        That said, it wasn't Amane's idea. Rather, Yuuta often approached him, and Amane did<p></p>
        his best to handle the attention despite his obvious confusion.<p></p>
        The day of the opening ceremony, he had felt for an instant that the events of the past<p></p>
        might be repeating, and that had naturally set him on edge. But Yuuta was clearly a<p></p>
        different kind of person than his former friend.<p></p>
        Amane was still slightly on guard, but that didn't mean he wanted to awkwardly keep<p></p>
        Yuuta at arm's length, and as they spent time together, Amane began to recognize that<p></p>
        Yuuta was a cheerful, honest, and compassionate young man. Above all, he had Itsuki's<p></p>
        seal of approval, so Amane didn't think he was someone who demanded his suspicion.<p></p>
        After attending his first week of school as a second-year high school student, Amane<p></p>
        noticed that the pain he had been harboring for so long began to fade.<p></p>
        "Hey, are you cool with this?"<p></p>
        Sitting across from Amane, Itsuki said that as if he had suddenly remembered to ask.<p></p>
        At the moment, they were having lunch in the cafeteria just like they had done since<p></p>
        their first year.<p></p>
        Sometimes Chitose would join them, but today she was off eating with Mahiru. Amane<p></p>
        was glad the two of them got along, even in public.<p></p>
        "Cool with what?"<p></p>
        "I mean: keeping things as they are with you know who."<p></p>
        "There's no need to go out of my way to talk to her at school."<p></p>
        By which I mean, if I speak to her, everyone around us is going to stare and wonder where<p></p>
        I got the nerve.<p></p>
        It wouldn't do for meek, unfashionable Amane to be seen approaching Mahiru.<p></p>
        "Dude, she's just itching to talk to you, and it shows."<p></p>
        "…Yeah, I noticed."<p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to be doing her best to ignore Amane, but every now and then she<p></p>
        would slip up and stare over at him glumly.<p></p>
        So far, she'd only done it when nobody else was looking, but Chitose had taken it upon<p></p>
        herself to start giving Amane dirty looks on Mahiru's behalf, so it was becoming harder<p></p>
        and harder to endure.<p></p>
        "You need to transform. There's no other way."<p></p>
        "No way; dressing up like that is a huge pain, and you know I don't like the attention."<p></p>
        Besides, even if the rumors had settled down for the moment, some people had seen<p></p>
        him out and about with Mahiru, even if they hadn't recognized him. If people made the<p></p>
        connection that Amane was the mystery man, things would probably get so hectic it<p></p>
        would derail his whole high school career.<p></p>
        "Why are you like this…? And honestly, you could be so popular." 1<p></p>
        "That makes no sense."<p></p>
        Amane couldn't imagine changing his hair a little bit and suddenly becoming popular,<p></p>
        but Itsuki seemed convinced for some reason.<p></p>
        "I think you've got the kind of personality that girls want in a boyfriend. You've got a<p></p>
        cynical side, but you're also sincere, and you're the type of guy who treats girls well."<p></p>
        "…Isn't that normal?"<p></p>
        "I think there are a lot of guys who can't even do that much. Like, you're the type who<p></p>
        can figure out what a girl wants and then make it happen. You don't make a big deal<p></p>
        out of it; you just pay attention and then act on what you see."<p></p>
        "…You sound awfully sure about this."<p></p>
        "If you weren't that type of guy, do you really think that a cautious girl who's always<p></p>
        hiding behind a guarded smile would have ever gotten attached to you?"<p></p>
        When he put it that way, Amane couldn't refute his friend's theory.<p></p>
        He bit his lip hard as he mulled it over, and Itsuki laughed.<p></p>
        "…Also, can I say one thing?" his friend continued.<p></p>
        "What?"<p></p>
        "If you weren't into her, you probably wouldn't treat her as well as you do."<p></p>
        "Shut up. Is it so bad being nice to someone?"<p></p>
        Itsuki could read him like a book. There was no hiding how he felt. Amane turned away<p></p>
        and began sulkily slurping up the noodles he'd ordered for lunch.<p></p>
        Rather than teasing him further, Itsuki nodded sagely and acted impressed.<p></p>
        "If you ask me, you oughtta be happy. It's a wonderful thing to find someone to treasure."<p></p>
        "Oh, you think you're an expert?"<p></p>
        "I know I am."<p></p>
        "…I don't really care whether we get together. If there's someone out there who would<p></p>
        make her happy, I don't mind if it's not me."<p></p>
        If Mahiru chose some other, unknown man and was really, truly happy with him, Amane<p></p>
        would give them his blessing. If anyone deserved happiness, it was Mahiru. Of course,<p></p>
        he very much wanted to be the one to make her happy, but if she ended up finding<p></p>
        fulfillment elsewhere, he wouldn't balk at swallowing his feelings.<p></p>
        "…You're such a wuss."<p></p>
        "And you're a jackass… Look, I do want to make her happy, I do, but—"<p></p>
        "Then just tell her that already."<p></p>
        "I can't just come out and say it, you moron!"<p></p>
        How can I confess my feelings if I haven't even figured them out myself?<p></p>
        Mahiru was so cautious when it came to relationships that Amane was sure there was<p></p>
        no way she would be willing to go out with someone for fun or just to try things out.<p></p>
        It was all or nothing.<p></p>
        And given everything with Mahiru's parents, she's not likely to agree to date so easily<p></p>
        anyway.<p></p>
        "…You are a serious late bloomer."<p></p>
        "Shut up. It's fine; I can get her to like me in my own way."<p></p>
        "…Well, as an objective observer, I think it'd be better if you tell her everything straight<p></p>
        up, but—"<p></p>
        "But what?"<p></p>
        "…Nothing," Itsuki muttered. "…All right; good luck. I'm rooting for you."<p></p>
        Amane frowned, but he was actually really grateful for his friend's somewhatexasperated encouragement.<p></p>
        "Oh, Fujimiya, don't see you here often."<p></p>
        Amane had stopped by the local arcade after school. He was just inserting a bill into<p></p>
        the change machine when he heard a familiar voice.<p></p>
        He stuffed his change into his wallet and turned around to find Yuuta standing there.<p></p>
        He had apparently also come to play games and was standing behind Amane with his<p></p>
        wallet in one hand.<p></p>
        "Kadowaki? You're an even rarer sight. What happened to track club?"<p></p>
        "We have a break today. It's not good to work the body too hard day after day."<p></p>
        "Ah."<p></p>
        So the school's top track-and-field star takes a vacation once in a while, too, eh?<p></p>
        Amane stepped back from the machine, and Yuuta inserted his bills and waited for the<p></p>
        change. Once he'd deposited about two thousand yen worth of coins back in his wallet,<p></p>
        Yuuta noticed Amane staring at him and smiled.<p></p>
        "I'm surprised to find you in a place like this, Fujimiya. You don't seem like you would<p></p>
        appreciate the noise much."<p></p>
        "I hit up game centers like everyone else. I just don't like to waste money, so I don't go<p></p>
        that often."<p></p>
        "Hmm. Well, what did you come for today?"<p></p>
        "I wanted to check out the crane games. I got an order to pick up a stuffed animal."<p></p>
        Actually, it was more like Chitose had shown him the NEW ARRIVALS page of the game<p></p>
        center's website and pointed out which ones Mahiru might like, so he had decided to<p></p>
        get one as a present for Mahiru, since she had seemed a little down lately.<p></p>
        Also, as he had seen in the infamous photo Chitose had sent him, Mahiru's apartment<p></p>
        was quite sparse. So he was hoping to win a cute friend for the teddy bear he'd already<p></p>
        gotten her.<p></p>
        "Do you think you can win a stuffed animal?"<p></p>
        "It's kind of my specialty."<p></p>
        The crane arms at this particular arcade were stronger than usual, so it was easy to<p></p>
        pick up the toys. As long as he accounted for the balance and position of the stuffed<p></p>
        animals when controlling the crane, it was surprisingly easy to snag a prize.<p></p>
        It was actually his mother who had taught him how, way back in elementary school.<p></p>
        "This one, you see? If you bring the arm down right here, you can get it no problem. And<p></p>
        this one is good, too. Just hook the tag with the arm."It was one of many pointless talents<p></p>
        that had rubbed off on him.<p></p>
        Yuuta was giving him an incredulous look, so Amane led his classmate over to the<p></p>
        corner crammed with all the crane games. He decided to try his luck on a machine in<p></p>
        the new-arrivals section filled with stuffed rabbits.<p></p>
        Amane casually put a coin in the slot. Judging by the placement of the stuffed animals<p></p>
        and the size of the crane arm, a single coin would be enough. Some prizes took a lot of<p></p>
        money to win, but one of these stuffed rabbits—a character Amane didn't recognize—<p></p>
        should be easy.<p></p>
        He aimed the crane at the place where the rabbit's head and body met and skillfully<p></p>
        guided the arm into place, catching the head and avoiding the body. As the crane came<p></p>
        back up, it brought the prize with it, secured by the head. When he took his hand off<p></p>
        the lever, the stuffed rabbit tumbled down the prize shoot with a plop.<p></p>
        Amane casually pulled it out and turned to show Yuuta, who looked impressed.<p></p>
        "Wow!"<p></p>
        "The crane arms at this game center are strong, and the staff are friendly, so if you get<p></p>
        stuck, they'll show you how to win. It's a good place for beginners, too."<p></p>
        "So that's why Itsuki and the others said this place would be good? I see now." Yuuta<p></p>
        nodded. "By the way, is that a gift for someone in particular?"<p></p>
        "Yeah. Someone who takes good care of me. I want to show my appreciation."<p></p>
        Well, it's not a lie.<p></p>
        I just conveniently left out the fact that I'm talking about Mahiru. It's true she takes care<p></p>
        of me, and I am grateful for what she does every day.<p></p>
        He also quite simply thought Mahiru would look adorable surrounded by stuffed<p></p>
        animals, so his choice of gift was not entirely innocent.<p></p>
        "You're a really thoughtful guy, Fujimiya. But I knew that already."<p></p>
        "What do you mean, you knew that?"<p></p>
        "Well, you're sensitive, and you always act like a gentleman. Plus, you help people out<p></p>
        without making a big deal of it."<p></p>
        "Sometimes, I guess."<p></p>
        "Even if it's only sometimes, you helped me. Like with the bags and stuff, that was a<p></p>
        big help." Yuuta thanked him again with a bright smile, and Amane felt slightly<p></p>
        embarrassed.<p></p>
        It really wasn't a big deal, but apparently Yuuta still remembered it.<p></p>
        Amane usually had shopping bags on hand anyway, and it hadn't been his intention to<p></p>
        make Yuuta feel indebted to him.<p></p>
        "…Oh yeah, did you eat all that Valentine's chocolate, Kadowaki?" Amane asked, trying<p></p>
        to move past the awkwardness he felt when confronted with Yuuta's overflowing<p></p>
        gratitude.<p></p>
        Yuuta's expression grew cloudy. "Ah… Can you keep a secret? I only ate the storebought ones."<p></p>
        "You didn't eat the handmade ones?"<p></p>
        "…The handmade chocolates are… How do I put this? I'm sure there are some girls<p></p>
        who can make them well, but—"<p></p>
        "They're bad?"<p></p>
        "No, it's just… Sometimes they have hairs in them or other things that clearly shouldn't<p></p>
        be in there."<p></p>
        "Are we still talking about chocolate…?"<p></p>
        Finding out that something like that had accidentally gotten mixed in would have been<p></p>
        bad enough, but from hearing his voice, Amane suspected that Yuuta had discovered<p></p>
        intentional adulterations on more than one occasion.<p></p>
        He remembered reading somewhere that, long ago, people had believed mixing a part<p></p>
        of the body into someone's food could work like a magic charm to make them fall in<p></p>
        love. The person who consumed the secret ingredient was supposed to be helpless to<p></p>
        resist the effects.<p></p>
        "I accept the gifts, even if they've got… stuff in them, but… that used to happen a lot,<p></p>
        and I'm still afraid it might happen again, so I tell everyone ahead of time that I won't<p></p>
        eat any handmade chocolates. The ones who give them to me anyway… Well, I appreciate<p></p>
        the thought behind the present, and I do still pay back every gift. Unfortunately, some<p></p>
        of them try to disguise it as store-bought chocolate, but… What can you do? And of<p></p>
        course, if it happens more than once, I never accept chocolate from that girl again,<p></p>
        so…" Yuuta trailed off, looking sad and lost. Amane couldn't help but feel bad for him.<p></p>
        "…I guess even popular guys have it rough."<p></p>
        "Meanwhile, everybody is so jealous of me, I feel like I can't complain, but… It's not<p></p>
        like I want to be popular. Honestly, it's miserable. I'd give it all up if I could."<p></p>
        "Sounds serious." Amane nodded.<p></p>
        "I mean, yeah, it's disturbing. Girls give me sweets or food with weird stuff hidden in<p></p>
        it, smiling the whole time."<p></p>
        It was only reasonable to be apprehensive.<p></p>
        Ordinarily, most boys would treasure a girl's handmade food, but for Yuuta it was a<p></p>
        potential threat. Going through something so awful so many times must have been<p></p>
        terrible.<p></p>
        "Sometimes I think it would be easier if I went out with someone, so the other girls<p></p>
        would stop flirting with me… but I'm afraid whoever I picked would end up getting<p></p>
        bullied."<p></p>
        "…Jealousy's a scary thing."<p></p>
        "Yeah…"<p></p>
        Yuuta's shoulders slumped like he was at a complete loss. He seemed exhausted.<p></p>
        Amane won a large bag of potato sticks from a nearby machine and offered them to<p></p>
        the sad boy in front of him.<p></p>
        "Eat these; you'll feel better," he said. "And you know, if you ever want to talk or<p></p>
        something, you can come to Itsuki or me."<p></p>
        "It's just hard sometimes… So I appreciate it."<p></p>
        Seeing Yuuta so troubled, it occurred to Amane that popularity didn't always make<p></p>
        people's lives easier or better.<p></p>
        When Amane got home, Mahiru heard him entering and came to the door to greet him.<p></p>
        She was wearing her apron and had her hair up in a bun. She always tied it back when<p></p>
        she was cooking, but this time she had added a braid as a cute flourish that accentuated<p></p>
        her practical style.<p></p>
        Mahiru smiled, a little relieved now that Amane had returned. Apparently, she had<p></p>
        already finished making dinner.<p></p>
        After leaving the arcade, Amane had gone to a cafe with Yuuta to listen to him complain<p></p>
        over coffee. He had let Mahiru know he would be late, but evidently she had still<p></p>
        worried.<p></p>
        "Welcome home, Amane… What's in the bag?"<p></p>
        "I stopped by the arcade and got some prizes."<p></p>
        The huge bag was crammed full of all the things he'd won, including the stuffed rabbit.<p></p>
        It was obvious just by looking that there was a lot inside.<p></p>
        "…That's quite the haul."<p></p>
        "And I only used about two days' worth of lunch money."<p></p>
        "Wow, what did you win?"<p></p>
        "Maybe we can save that for later? I'm starving."<p></p>
        Amane wanted to find the right moment to present her with the rabbit. Her surprise<p></p>
        would be worth the wait.<p></p>
        Besides, his stomach was growling. He wasn't lying when he said he wanted to enjoy<p></p>
        some of Mahiru's delicious cooking.<p></p>
        "In that case, go change and wash your hands—and don't forget to gargle. While you<p></p>
        do, I'll set the table."<p></p>
        "Roger, roger." 1<p></p>
        He didn't really need the reminders, but it still made him happy to hear her concern<p></p>
        for him. She was maybe even acting a little maternal, but he didn't say that out loud<p></p>
        and instead headed to the bathroom as instructed.<p></p>
        "…So what did you bring back that needed such a large bag?"<p></p>
        The prizes must have been on Mahiru's mind. After dinner, she glanced over at the bag<p></p>
        sitting beside the sofa and asked about it again.<p></p>
        "Hmm? Stuffed animals."<p></p>
        Amane had no intention of hiding it, so he picked up the bag and set it on his lap, then<p></p>
        peeled off the tape keeping it closed.<p></p>
        "Stuffed animals?"<p></p>
        "You like them, right, Mahiru?"<p></p>
        "Y-yeah, I do, but—"<p></p>
        "I saw a few I thought you might like, so I got them for you. Here."<p></p>
        The best prize among the day's winnings had to be the stuffed bunny that was about<p></p>
        the same size as the bear he had given her before. It was pretty large, and he had won<p></p>
        it with only a single coin, so he decided it was all right to feel a little proud.<p></p>
        He pulled out the bunny and set it on Mahiru's knee, where she could get a good view<p></p>
        of its white fur and big round eyes.<p></p>
        He didn't really know anything about the particular mascot. He had simply picked it<p></p>
        out because a bunny seemed like something Mahiru would like.<p></p>
        She stared at the stuffed rabbit sitting on her knee.<p></p>
        "You… don't like rabbits?"<p></p>
        "…It's cute."<p></p>
        "I'm glad."<p></p>
        Mahiru wrapped both arms around the stuffed rabbit and squeezed it tight against her<p></p>
        cheek, just like she always did with her favorite cushion. For a second, Amane thought<p></p>
        about getting out his phone for a picture but ultimately decided against it.<p></p>
        She was smiling softly, so he captured the scene with his mental camera and pulled<p></p>
        another stuffed animal from the densely packed bag.<p></p>
        "There's more. I've got cats and dogs and—"<p></p>
        Thanks to the crane arms at that game center being relatively strong, Amane had been<p></p>
        able to get most of the prizes for very little money, so he had picked up toy after toy,<p></p>
        grabbing any and all he thought Mahiru would like.<p></p>
        As he added a beige-and-white stuffed cat that looked sort of like Mahiru's style and a<p></p>
        plush Shiba Inu dog, she looked at him with bewilderment.<p></p>
        "Uh, um, this many…?"<p></p>
        "I… Uh, I hope they won't be in the way…"<p></p>
        "No, not at all! I don't have any decorations in my apartment, and they're very cute.<p></p>
        I'm happy."<p></p>
        "That's great."<p></p>
        As he had imagined, Mahiru looked adorable surrounded by a small herd of stuffed<p></p>
        animals.<p></p>
        She was still hugging the bunny, but she looked back and forth restlessly between the<p></p>
        cat and dog, wondering which to hug next. Amane couldn't help but smile, and Mahiru<p></p>
        must have noticed him watching her, because her face turned bright red, and she tried<p></p>
        to hide behind the stuffed rabbit.<p></p>
        The contrast between the rabbit's white fur and her blushing cheeks was striking.<p></p>
        Mahiru's eyes, peeking out from the gap between the bunny's ears, were a bit teary,<p></p>
        which only made her more adorable. Finally, overcome by embarrassment, she leaned<p></p>
        over and buried her face in Amane's shoulder.<p></p>
        "…Don't grin at me like that."<p></p>
        "I wasn't."<p></p>
        "You were! You were smiling. Laughing at me for being childish."<p></p>
        "That's not why I was smiling. It's because you're cute."<p></p>
        "…So you were smiling after all, weren't you?"<p></p>
        "You got me," he said teasingly, flashing her another big grin. This time, Mahiru slapped<p></p>
        his thigh, so he rubbed her head in an attempt to pacify her for the time being.<p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to settle down, and when he grinned at her again, he did his best to<p></p>
        make sure she didn't notice.<p></p>
        "…I feel like this is all a trick or something."<p></p>
        "It's only your imagination."<p></p>
        "…Well, just for today, I'll play along," Mahiru muttered disapprovingly. Amane decided<p></p>
        not to point out that she was still smiling.<p></p>
        Looking at the cat that was in Mahiru's lap and the bunny she was holding, he thought<p></p>
        she reminded him a little of both of those animals as he continued stroking her hair.<p></p>
        Mahiru suddenly sat up. Her cheeks were still flushed, but Amane could see a new<p></p>
        tinge of protest in her eyes.<p></p>
        "…I'm always on the receiving end."<p></p>
        Apparently, all the gifts were making her uncomfortable.<p></p>
        "I'm just doing what I want to do, so don't worry about it."<p></p>
        "But… I'm always getting things from you. You give me presents, and you're so<p></p>
        thoughtful, and you spend so much time with me… Everything."<p></p>
        "But those are all things I want to give you, so there's nothing for you to worry about."<p></p>
        It's not like I'm expecting to be paid back or anything. It's just because I want to make her<p></p>
        happy. Maybe that makes it sound like her happiness is my compensation or something,<p></p>
        but the truth is it's all for my own satisfaction. It feels good to make her happy, so I do.<p></p>
        That's all there is to it.<p></p>
        But apparently Mahiru felt guilty. That seemed absurd to Amane, considering all the<p></p>
        trouble she went to for his sake, plus all the care and attention she always gave him.<p></p>
        He honestly didn't think he was anywhere close to balancing the scales.<p></p>
        But it seemed Mahiru felt the opposite.<p></p>
        "I want to give something back," she insisted.<p></p>
        "You're so stubborn…," he teased. "But… I guess if you feel that strongly, there is maybe<p></p>
        one thing I'd like."<p></p>
        "If it's something I can give, name it."<p></p>
        She really seemed like she was ready to do whatever he asked. Of course, he wasn't<p></p>
        going to put her on the spot with anything crazy. But he had to make a request of some<p></p>
        kind, or Mahiru would feel even worse.<p></p>
        "I want a pudding."<p></p>
        And so Amane gladly asked for something he knew Mahiru could handle.<p></p>
        "…A pudding?"<p></p>
        "One with plenty of eggs. I want to eat your homemade version."<p></p>
        "…You don't mean one from the store, right? That's not nearly enough to pay you back."<p></p>
        "Of course not. I'll only be satisfied if you make it yourself."<p></p>
        Amane didn't care for most sweets, but pudding was a different matter.<p></p>
        He liked cream puffs that were made with only pudding or custard-cream filling and<p></p>
        knew that if Mahiru made the pudding by hand, it was sure to be delicious. A sweet<p></p>
        treat skillfully handcrafted by a girl he liked… He couldn't think of anything better.<p></p>
        He made his request very seriously, and Mahiru stared up at him silently for a moment,<p></p>
        then nodded sharply.<p></p>
        "…All right, I'll make some this weekend. A stiff pudding with lots of egg, right?"<p></p>
        "Mm-hmm."<p></p>
        "I'll do my best to make something tasty!"<p></p>
        "Okay, okay, you don't have to get so worked up…"<p></p>
        "If I'm doing it, I'm going to do it right."<p></p>
        "Is that how it is?"<p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to be taking this very seriously for some reason. Amane thought that<p></p>
        maybe she didn't need to try so hard, but since he was going to get a delicious pudding<p></p>
        out of it, he couldn't complain.<p></p>
        He stroked her head once more to show his support, and Mahiru looked slightly<p></p>
        bashful and buried the lower part of her face in the back of the bunny's head.<p></p>
        Soft puddings with an abundance of heavy cream were delicious, of course, but for<p></p>
        Amane, the best pudding was a stiff one with plenty of egg, the kind that held its shape<p></p>
        even in the spoon.<p></p>
        The pudding that Mahiru made clearly highlighted the taste of the egg yolks while<p></p>
        carefully balancing the richness of the heavy cream. It had a clean, distinct flavor, and<p></p>
        the touch of the caramel's burnt-sugar bitterness kept the whole thing from being too<p></p>
        sweet.<p></p>
        Amane found himself bringing spoonful after spoonful to his mouth as if in a trance.<p></p>
        Before he knew it, Mahiru's pudding had completely disappeared from his dish.<p></p>
        "Man, that was insanely good."<p></p>
        "I'm really flattered to hear that."<p></p>
        She had brought out the pudding after dinner, and Amane had made short work of it.<p></p>
        One serving hadn't been enough, so he'd asked for seconds.<p></p>
        For a high school boy, Amane didn't have that big of an appetite, but when it came to<p></p>
        Mahiru's homemade desserts, he was not surprised to find that he always had room.<p></p>
        Feeling even more satisfied than expected for how much he ate, Amane felt utterly<p></p>
        content. He rubbed his bulging belly.<p></p>
        "You really can make anything, huh?"<p></p>
        "Well, I had a very… demanding education," Mahiru replied. She was not boasting in<p></p>
        the slightest, but it was true that her culinary repertoire was impressive. Sometimes<p></p>
        she even made dishes Amane had never seen before. They were always good, and he<p></p>
        couldn't get enough of her cooking. Having someone like Mahiru around to make him<p></p>
        delicious food was one of Amane's greatest joys.<p></p>
        "Well, I don't know what else to say, except thank you. I'm very happy."<p></p>
        "…Happy?"<p></p>
        "Sure. I mean, who could be unsatisfied with life when they get to eat tasty stuff like<p></p>
        this day after day? I always look forward to it."<p></p>
        Mahiru's cooking was pretty much what he looked forward to the most every day. As<p></p>
        long as he got to enjoy a meal with her at the end of the day, he could forget all his<p></p>
        woes and troubles.<p></p>
        Just the very fact that she was cooking for him all the time was cause for joy, and he<p></p>
        was flooded with feelings of happiness every time he took a bite, but Mahiru didn't<p></p>
        really seem to understand the value of her own dishes.<p></p>
        Once before, Amane had said that Mahiru's cooking tasted like happiness, but Mahiru<p></p>
        didn't seem to understand. If Amane didn't heap high praise on her, she might never<p></p>
        recognize its value.<p></p>
        Besides, it was good manners to compliment the cook when their dishes were<p></p>
        phenomenal, and he intended to follow through on that.<p></p>
        "…Y-you really think so?"<p></p>
        Mahiru's cheeks flushed slightly at his praise, and she shrunk into herself a little.<p></p>
        "…It makes me happy when you say things like that, Amane."<p></p>
        "Well, if you don't mind that they're coming from me, I'll give you as many compliments<p></p>
        as you like. Maybe you want me to be more specific, instead of just saying that<p></p>
        everything is good? I can do that, no problem."<p></p>
        Rifts between couples often start with forgetting to thank each other, after all.<p></p>
        Not that he and Mahiru were a couple or anything. But she made dinner for him on an<p></p>
        almost daily basis, and he believed it was important to express his gratitude often. And<p></p>
        besides, getting good feedback probably made her feel more motivated, so if she<p></p>
        wanted, he was prepared to present detailed notes.<p></p>
        But Mahiru shook her head, directly rejecting that idea.<p></p>
        "P-please don't… I'd die if you did."<p></p>
        "That's a little extreme, isn't it?"<p></p>
        "I'm being serious. What you do now is already perfect."<p></p>
        "Really? But you're going to keep making food for me, so I want to show you my<p></p>
        appreciation properly. Thank you for everything."<p></p>
        Honestly, these days, Amane's diet entirely depended on Mahiru's cooking, so he felt<p></p>
        like he owed her a lot and wanted to do what he could for her. She was so very<p></p>
        important to him. When Mahiru wasn't around, Amane quickly fell back into his old<p></p>
        hopeless habits, so he hoped she would stay by his side for a long time.<p></p>
        He smiled gratefully, and Mahiru trembled like a phone on vibrate, then quickly stood<p></p>
        up.<p></p>
        "…Stupid Amane…" she said in a cute voice. Then she carried the dishes over to the<p></p>
        sink. Amane followed, his own dishes in hand.<p></p>
        She had moved suddenly, so Amane wanted to get her attention to tell her he'd handle<p></p>
        the cleanup and that she didn't have to do anything else. The moment he lightly caught<p></p>
        hold of Mahiru's arm, she whirled around to face him.<p></p>
        She looked at him with a face much redder than it had been before. She seemed like<p></p>
        she really couldn't stand being there a second longer.<p></p>
        "…I… I'll do the cleanup. You can go hang out on the sofa. Okay?"<p></p>
        He ruffled her hair once and chased her from the kitchen. Groaning softly, Mahiru<p></p>
        rushed for the couch and sank into the cushions. Amane was caught off guard by her<p></p>
        sudden lack of composure.<p></p>
        As he washed the dishes, Amane couldn't get her bashful expression out of his mind.<p></p>
        He switched the tap to cold water, hoping to cool his head off a little.<p></p>
        Chapter 29: The Angel and an Unwanted Imposition<p></p>
        Their classmates often called Mahiru an angel. Based on how gentle and modest she<p></p>
        was, her kind personality, the fact that she was accomplished in both academics and<p></p>
        sports, plus her unparalleled beauty, angel did seem like the appropriate nickname for<p></p>
        her. It was no surprise then that she was very popular.<p></p>
        During her first year of high school, many boys in many classes had confessed their<p></p>
        love for her, and she said that turning them all down was not a point of pride for her,<p></p>
        but an annoyance. She did not appreciate strangers approaching her for dates.<p></p>
        So as popular as Mahiru was, after about half a year of stubbornly refusing every suitor,<p></p>
        she had finally dissuaded the student body. By the time she met Amane, though many<p></p>
        boys were undoubtedly still interested in her, the spate of romantic confessions had<p></p>
        more or less abated.<p></p>
        But that also meant they had not ceased entirely, as Amane came to realize.<p></p>
        "Please go out with me."<p></p>
        It happened after school, when Mahiru had stopped by the library to return a book<p></p>
        before heading home.<p></p>
        The library room wasn't in building one, where their classroom was, but in building<p></p>
        two, meaning she had to walk through a connecting corridor to get there.<p></p>
        Building two was basically full of classrooms, and it was deserted after school let out,<p></p>
        save for the occasional student heading for a club meeting. Accordingly, there was very<p></p>
        little pedestrian traffic, and it was quiet, so the boy's request was perfectly audible.<p></p>
        When Amane heard the voice coming from below him as he walked down the<p></p>
        connecting corridor on the second floor, he tried to step lightly. He wasn't one to stick<p></p>
        his nose in strangers' love affairs. Those were private matters, and he didn't have much<p></p>
        interest in other peoples' romances anyway. So not wanting to eavesdrop, Amane tried<p></p>
        to briskly move along without making any noise.<p></p>
        "I'm so sorry, but I have to turn you down."<p></p>
        However, after hearing a very familiar voice, his body immediately went rigid despite<p></p>
        his best intentions. It was a gentle, soft voice that was usually very pleasant. But it had<p></p>
        an unmistakable edge to it now.<p></p>
        Even though he knew he shouldn't, Amane crept to a nearby window and peeked over<p></p>
        the lip. There on the first floor were Mahiru and a male student who might have been<p></p>
        a classmate. Luckily, neither of them seemed to have noticed him.<p></p>
        The boy had his back to Amane, so his expression wasn't visible, but Mahiru was<p></p>
        looking at her suitor calmly.<p></p>
        The graceful face of the class's angel was contorted into a somewhat apologetic<p></p>
        expression, showing she had no intention of accepting his offer.<p></p>
        "Why—?"<p></p>
        "I don't know you. I'm very sorry, but I cannot return your feelings."<p></p>
        "We can get to know each other once we're going out—"<p></p>
        "I think that dating is something people should do after they've already built a<p></p>
        relationship of mutual trust and affection. I'm not interested in going out with someone<p></p>
        on a whim—a shallow relationship like that would only do a disservice to everyone<p></p>
        involved."<p></p>
        Mahiru had never appreciated shows of affection from boys, especially boys she didn't<p></p>
        really know. And considering her home environment, the thought of dating a stranger<p></p>
        probably made her very uncomfortable. So she was obviously not going to easily agree<p></p>
        to go out with anybody who bothered to ask her.<p></p>
        Mahiru's voice was gentle, but her refusal was firm. There was nothing more to discuss,<p></p>
        so she nodded once and turned to leave, but… the would-be suitor grabbed her hand.<p></p>
        Mahiru's lovely voice came out in a small cry of distress. She turned around, frowning<p></p>
        nervously. "Excuse me. This is not okay." It seemed like she found his grip on her hand<p></p>
        painful.<p></p>
        "Sorry, but I can't just give up."<p></p>
        "I am not going to go out with you. Now please, let me go."<p></p>
        Though she spoke more forcefully this time, and with an undeniably disapproving<p></p>
        expression, Mahiru nevertheless maintained her angelic composure to the very end.<p></p>
        Still, the boy pressed her once more as he continued tugging on her hand. Now Mahiru<p></p>
        looked frightened, afraid of what the boy might do next.<p></p>
        Amane decided he couldn't let this go on any longer. He frowned and leaned out the<p></p>
        half-open window. "I don't think she appreciates you being so forward," he grumbled,<p></p>
        loudly enough for the two of them to hear.<p></p>
        The boy spun around frantically, and Mahiru took advantage of the distraction to slip<p></p>
        out of his grasp and quickly put some distance between the two of them. She must<p></p>
        have recognized Amane's voice, because she looked relieved at the sudden intrusion.<p></p>
        Though she had mostly maintained an impassive expression, Amane could tell that<p></p>
        Mahiru was disgusted and frightened by the boy's selfish actions.<p></p>
        This must really bother her…<p></p>
        Amane glared at her boorish suitor with a mixture of anger and disgust.<p></p>
        Understandably, the other boy's expression stiffened, which Amane took as a sign of a<p></p>
        guilty conscience.<p></p>
        "Sorry, I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but… I just happened to be passing through and<p></p>
        saw you two were having some kind of trouble; that's all. Plus, it sounded like Shiina<p></p>
        was in pain." Amane gestured to Mahiru, who was rubbing her hand where the boy<p></p>
        had grabbed her.<p></p>
        "A-are you really hurt?" the boy asked, looking even more unwell.<p></p>
        "…You were awfully rough when you grabbed me. And anyway, it's wrong to touch a<p></p>
        girl without her permission." Mahiru had regained her composure. Rather than just<p></p>
        angry, her voice was icy cold.<p></p>
        "So she says." Amane nodded. "You should watch it."<p></p>
        The male student bit his lip hard. "Sorry" was all he said before hurrying away.<p></p>
        Relieved that the other boy had finally run off, Amane turned toward Mahiru. She<p></p>
        smiled at him faintly, still defensively clutching her hand to her chest. Seeing that made<p></p>
        his heart ache, and he almost wanted to reach out to her. But they were still in school,<p></p>
        so Amane couldn't carelessly make contact.<p></p>
        Mahiru must have understood that. She bowed sharply and turned to walk away.<p></p>
        Somehow, she looked even more delicate than usual, but all Amane could do was<p></p>
        anxiously watch her go.<p></p>
        "Thanks for earlier."<p></p>
        That was the first thing Mahiru said to Amane once they'd gotten home. She was<p></p>
        wearing a troubled smile.<p></p>
        Mahiru must have been thinking about the incident, too. She sat down on the sofa next<p></p>
        to Amane, looking a little tired, and leaned back on the cushions. Normally, Mahiru sat<p></p>
        up very straight and proper. She must have been feeling a bit worn out.<p></p>
        "Honestly, I was wondering whether I might have overstepped," Amane confessed.<p></p>
        "No, you saved me. He wouldn't let go, even when I asked him to. Everyone knows I've<p></p>
        never accepted a love confession, and most guys seem to understand when I turn them<p></p>
        down, so they give up very quickly—but he was different."<p></p>
        Amane didn't know how many dozens of boys had told her they loved her, but it<p></p>
        sounded like a considerable number. Nonetheless, Mahiru had never accepted a<p></p>
        proposal. It occurred to Amane that if she ever did start dating someone, their time<p></p>
        together would definitely come to an end.<p></p>
        "…You really are popular, huh?"<p></p>
        "Well, I suppose I am. Though it's not something that makes me happy." Typical of<p></p>
        Mahiru to openly acknowledge it as fact and then clearly express her true feelings on<p></p>
        the matter. "I appreciate that they feel affection toward me, but the sheer number of<p></p>
        times this has happened is alarming…"<p></p>
        Mahiru muttered something else in a somewhat apologetic tone about not knowing<p></p>
        how to manage all those expectations, and Amane realized she must have to deal with<p></p>
        this kind of thing a lot.<p></p>
        Amane didn't interact much with Mahiru in school. Whenever he thought about her,<p></p>
        he inevitably looked at her, so he was deliberately trying to limit those incidents<p></p>
        whenever possible. That was partly why he had no idea how often she had to field<p></p>
        these romantic appeals.<p></p>
        "And I'm sure you always graciously and candidly decline, eh?"<p></p>
        "Well, if someone comes to me to earnestly express their feelings, of course I'm going<p></p>
        to hear them out before I turn them away. It would be rude just to ignore them, after<p></p>
        all. Though I don't think all of them are equally serious about their feelings, you know?"<p></p>
        "Oh yeah?"<p></p>
        "Absolutely. There are some boys who confess their feelings knowing that I'll turn<p></p>
        them down, like it's all some kind of twisted game. Others just like the way I look and<p></p>
        want me for a trophy. I have no intention of entertaining something so superficial, of<p></p>
        course."<p></p>
        "I'm surprised there are guys who can muster up the will to confess with such flimsy<p></p>
        reasons."<p></p>
        He had serious doubts about the first group of guys, and when it came to the second<p></p>
        group, well, Amane had always believed that a relationship had to be a serious thing.<p></p>
        If someone was going to confess their love, they ought to really mean it, and he wasn't<p></p>
        even sure he considered such superficial feelings "love" at all.<p></p>
        "Well, I politely send those guys away, just like all the others. I can't accept any of their<p></p>
        proposals on a fundamental level. It's just not possible." Mahiru's voice had turned<p></p>
        cold again.<p></p>
        Amane recalled her reaction the first time she had come into his apartment—and he<p></p>
        had accidentally touched on a sensitive subject—and felt he couldn't say anything<p></p>
        further.<p></p>
        Mahiru was obviously not interested in pursuing frivolous relationships. Amane was<p></p>
        the same way, and he reflected once more on the fact that while his words back then<p></p>
        had been due to a misunderstanding, it was still very rude.<p></p>
        Looking over at Mahiru, he could see that her eyes weren't as cold as they had been<p></p>
        before, and even though he knew that her aggravated, scornful look wasn't meant for<p></p>
        him, he still shrank back a little.<p></p>
        "Anyway, it might be a naive question, but… do people think I'm such a simple person<p></p>
        that I would agree to go out with someone I barely know?"<p></p>
        "No, I don't think that's quite it…"<p></p>
        "Well then, why all the hopeless attempts? It's so strange that they think I might say<p></p>
        yes even though I don't know them. It's just scary being approached by strangers all<p></p>
        the time," Mahiru muttered, clearly troubled by getting so many confessions.<p></p>
        "…Do you think they lose control of themselves because they want you to notice them<p></p>
        or something?"<p></p>
        "So you're saying it's okay for them to grab me or get rough because they can't control<p></p>
        themselves?" Her mood seemed to be getting even worse.<p></p>
        Amane shook his head sharply to dispel any misunderstanding that Mahiru might be<p></p>
        having about what he said. "No, of course not. There's nothing wrong with having<p></p>
        feelings for someone, but it's not right to push them on anyone else or selfishly try to<p></p>
        force their hand. I'm definitely not trying to defend what that guy did. If anything, I'm<p></p>
        angry about it."<p></p>
        Mahiru was very beautiful, and Amane couldn't blame someone for wanting to win<p></p>
        her affection. After all, he had feelings for her himself. But he would never try to force<p></p>
        his feelings on Mahiru. The moment he used them to justify making her uncomfortable<p></p>
        would be the moment he'd gone too far.<p></p>
        This time, at least, Amane had happened to be there to step in. He shuddered to think<p></p>
        about someone grabbing her like that when he wasn't around. While he knew that<p></p>
        Mahiru would not hesitate to defend herself, physically if necessary, it was still an<p></p>
        unpleasant thought.<p></p>
        "…Is that so?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        "One hundred percent." Amane replied. "It was awful of him to try to force himself on<p></p>
        you like that… Weren't you scared?"<p></p>
        "I was a little scared, but if he had tried to hurt me at all, I was going to kick him right<p></p>
        in the crotch with all my strength."<p></p>
        Just as he suspected, Mahiru would not have hesitated to retaliate with force. If she<p></p>
        was being threatened, anyone would understand it if she defended herself.<p></p>
        "I think that would have taken care of it," Amane said. "Gotta admit, just thinking about<p></p>
        it makes me a little nervous."<p></p>
        "Not that I would do anything like that to you, Amane."<p></p>
        "Well, I hope I never give you any reason to."<p></p>
        His parents would disown him if he ever tried something like that. And it was against<p></p>
        his own principles to begin with. Forcing oneself on a girl would be a disgrace to all<p></p>
        men.<p></p>
        Amane thought he had made his position on the matter clear, but Mahiru was intently<p></p>
        watching him with a hint of exasperation.<p></p>
        "…Of course you wouldn't. Not Amane, the perfect gentleman."<p></p>
        "Why do I get the feeling that you're angry at me?"<p></p>
        "Oh, no, I'm just complimenting you."<p></p>
        "The look in your eyes doesn't seem very approving."<p></p>
        "Why, you must be imagining things."<p></p>
        Both her tone of voice and the look in her eyes were far from amicable. Rather, she<p></p>
        seemed dissatisfied. What she was saying and the way she was saying it didn't match,<p></p>
        and Amane couldn't figure out what she really meant. His eyes darted nervously around<p></p>
        the room as he squirmed under her gaze. Mahiru smiled slightly, as if to say that his<p></p>
        discomfort was unavoidable.<p></p>
        "Well, when it comes to respecting a girl's space, you're perfect, Amane, but you do<p></p>
        have one weakness, you know?"<p></p>
        "And what might that be…?"<p></p>
        "A weakness to me, am I right?" 4<p></p>
        Startled by her sudden impish smile, Amane averted his eyes, but Mahiru didn't seem<p></p>
        to notice his discomfort and leaned against him a little bit.<p></p>
        She didn't seem to notice his heart threatening to leap out of his chest, either.<p></p>
        "It might sound a bit presumptuous, but popularity really is its own problem, you<p></p>
        know?" Mahiru muttered in a hoarse voice. She sounded truly troubled. "I'm aware that,<p></p>
        physically at least, I'm more attractive than most people. So things like this happen a<p></p>
        lot, and I'm tired of it."<p></p>
        "…Sounds tough."<p></p>
        "It is. Oh, I'm sure there are some girls who might say it would be a wonderful problem<p></p>
        to have, but honestly, I wish I didn't have to deal with strangers constantly confessing<p></p>
        their love to me and then getting moody when I turn them down, or even worse,<p></p>
        latching on to me or flying into a rage. Even at the best of times, it gets exhausting<p></p>
        having to reject so many advances. And I feel guilty when I turn them down, too, you<p></p>
        know."<p></p>
        Mahiru had no mercy for anyone she decided was her enemy. At the same time, she<p></p>
        was fundamentally a virtuous and sensible girl and generally treated everyone she<p></p>
        met kindly.<p></p>
        "I don't think it's any joking matter to be in danger just by being myself," Mahiru<p></p>
        muttered. "It's not like I worked so hard to improve myself simply to be somebody's<p></p>
        accessory."<p></p>
        Mahiru sighed audibly. She sounded truly fed up and exhausted. Popularity certainly<p></p>
        came with its own set of hardships.<p></p>
        Amane reached out and gently stroked her hair. Mahiru let him do it, passively<p></p>
        accepting the reassuring gesture.<p></p>
        This completely different response to physical contact lay in the relationship of mutual<p></p>
        trust between Mahiru and him. As he patted her on the head, taking care not to entangle<p></p>
        his fingers in her fine hair, Mahiru closed her eyes, seemingly enjoying the moment.<p></p>
        She almost resembled a cat who was letting a trusted companion fawn over her.<p></p>
        "The persona I use at school is one that I chose, but it makes things difficult when<p></p>
        people want to get to know me. I won't let anyone touch me unless I want them to."<p></p>
        As a slightly—no, quite—displeased-looking Mahiru uttered those words, Amane's<p></p>
        hand hesitated. Right now she was letting him touch her, but he couldn't help but<p></p>
        wonder if he was somehow taking advantage of her being upset.<p></p>
        "Why did you stop?" 2<p></p>
        "Well, I, uh…," Amane stammered. "I suddenly feel a little self-conscious about all those<p></p>
        times I touched you before…"<p></p>
        "If I didn't like it, I would have stopped you the first time, so you can relax."<p></p>
        "G-gotcha."<p></p>
        "You can touch me even more… if you want." 3<p></p>
        She peered up at Amane and smiled gently, and in her eyes he could see trust and a<p></p>
        glimmer of anticipation.<p></p>
        Amane gulped. "Th-that's, um—" He didn't know how to reply.<p></p>
        "I'm just joking." Mahiru's expression returned to normal, and she giggled. Her gaze<p></p>
        dropped. "But please… keep holding my hand. What happened today was a little<p></p>
        unnerving."<p></p>
        Amane wasn't sure how to respond to her quiet words or to the heart-wrenching<p></p>
        distress he could sense welling up inside her, so he just bit his lip and took her hand.<p></p>
        Mahiru's fingers were elegant and dainty. As he traced his fingers over hers, he could<p></p>
        feel that they were soft but strong, with a slight callus where her pen usually rested.<p></p>
        They were not weak in the slightest.<p></p>
        But he also didn't think they were strong enough to fight off a high school boy. Amane<p></p>
        wasn't sure whether she hadn't been trying to shake him off or wasn't able to. Either<p></p>
        way, she had obviously been rattled by what happened.<p></p>
        Amane gently rubbed and massaged her hand, trying to help relax the fear that was<p></p>
        coiled up inside her.<p></p>
        Mahiru smiled, looking a bit better. "It's strange, you know. When you touch me, all I<p></p>
        feel is comfort."<p></p>
        "Part of me wishes you'd retained a bit of that caution you had when we first…"<p></p>
        He looked into Mahiru's eyes, asking silently if it was really all right to let him touch<p></p>
        her like this, and she answered with a beautiful smile.<p></p>
        "Oh, you're not satisfied with our current relationship?"<p></p>
        "It's n-not that I'm not satisfied, but… How do I put this…?"<p></p>
        "If I wasn't all right with it, I wouldn't be hanging around inside your apartment in the<p></p>
        first place, and I wouldn't be letting you touch me. I also never would have allowed<p></p>
        you to rest in my lap."<p></p>
        "You probably shouldn't have let me do that…"<p></p>
        "Even though you thoroughly enjoyed yourself?"<p></p>
        It was hard for Amane to argue that particular point.<p></p>
        He had happily laid his head down on Mahiru's thighs and fallen into a deep sleep, so<p></p>
        his insistence that they not do it again rang a bit hollow. Even if Mahiru had been the<p></p>
        one to propose it, he'd eagerly gone along with the idea in the end.<p></p>
        And so when Amane replied by averting his eyes somewhat and saying "…That was<p></p>
        that, and this is this," he received an amused laugh.<p></p>
        "Ha-ha! Very convenient. I'll have to remember to use that one later. But please… relax,<p></p>
        all right? I'll let you lay your head in my lap anytime you're tired."<p></p>
        "Ah, I think I'll refrain…"<p></p>
        Amane knew if he let himself get accustomed to such a wonderful experience, he'd<p></p>
        never be able to go back to being on his own. He'd become utterly hopeless, even more<p></p>
        than he already was, but with somehow even less ability to resist her.<p></p>
        When Amane gently declined her offer in the interest of preserving what little dignity<p></p>
        he had left, Mahiru smiled pleasantly. "Oh, that's too bad." She didn't seem particularly<p></p>
        disappointed. Amane figured she must have been making fun of him.<p></p>
        "…Don't tease me."<p></p>
        "I'm not. That's how I really feel."<p></p>
        In that case, she's just being mean.<p></p>
        Amane tried squeezing her hand harder to let her know how he felt, but Mahiru just<p></p>
        laughed like he was tickling her, and he had to quickly turn away to hide his obvious<p></p>
        embarrassment.<p></p>
        Chapter 30: The Angel’s Decision<p></p>
        "Itsuki! Fujimiya! Let's eat together!"<p></p>
        It was lunchtime at school, and Amane was on his way to get lunch with Itsuki as usual,<p></p>
        when a voice he had recently gotten used to hearing called out to him.<p></p>
        As expected, it was Yuuta Kadowaki, one hand waving in the air, exuding his bright and<p></p>
        amiable smile as always. Normally, Yuuta ate lunch with other friends, but apparently<p></p>
        today was different, as he approached them, wallet in hand.<p></p>
        Yuuta had been speaking to them more frequently since they started their second year,<p></p>
        but they still weren't especially close or anything.<p></p>
        But thanks to Amane listening to Yuuta's troubles the other day, an affinity had grown<p></p>
        between them, and more importantly, Amane had realized that Yuuta was actually a<p></p>
        pretty nice guy. In fact, he kind of reminded Amane of Itsuki.<p></p>
        "It's fine with me…," Amane said.<p></p>
        "Well, you don't mind, do you, Itsuki?"<p></p>
        "Why do you assume I won't mind? I mean, I won't, but…"<p></p>
        "Then it's all good, right?"<p></p>
        "Yeah, it's cool. Like, this guy here might have been sorta suspicious of you for no good<p></p>
        reason, but he warmed up to you pretty quick. And looks like you've gotten pretty<p></p>
        attached to Amane, too, Yuuta."<p></p>
        "Attached…?" Amane muttered. "He's not a dog."<p></p>
        "But Yuuta is kinda like a dog. He's the type where, once you win his trust, he'll always<p></p>
        stay close by, wagging his tail off. He's like… What's the breed…? Like a golden retriever."<p></p>
        "You guys shouldn't call people dogs right to their faces," Yuuta scolded.<p></p>
        But sure enough, once Amane pictured him as a golden retriever, he couldn't help but<p></p>
        laugh.<p></p>
        Yuuta noticed Amane's shoulders shaking with mirth and made a sour face, but Amane<p></p>
        could tell that the teasing didn't really bother him.<p></p>
        "Don't laugh, Fujimiya."<p></p>
        "Ha-ha, sorry."<p></p>
        "Amane was thinking the same thing, I knew it."<p></p>
        "I mean, it was a pretty accurate description…"<p></p>
        "Oh come on, not you too, Fujimiya. Look here, I only wanted to be your friend because<p></p>
        I thought you were a decent guy, you know?"<p></p>
        "Well, I guess it's a good thing Amane is finally getting a little recognition," Itsuki said.<p></p>
        "Anyway, c'mon, have a seat."<p></p>
        "Geez, who do you think you are?" Amane retorted, slapping Itsuki playfully.<p></p>
        Kadowaki obediently sauntered over, and when he made eye contact with Amane, he<p></p>
        broke into a beaming smile. If he had pointed that smile at any girl, she would have<p></p>
        been out cold.<p></p>
        Amane smiled wryly back. "…Can I ask you something?" he asked.<p></p>
        "Hmm?"<p></p>
        "Do you really want to be my friend?" Amane inquired. "I mean, I can't really imagine<p></p>
        what you'd get out of it, you know?" He hadn't intended to say such a thing, but it<p></p>
        slipped out of his mouth before he could stop it.<p></p>
        Yuuta was almost certainly trying to be Amane's friend because he liked him, but<p></p>
        Amane's memories of what had happened in the past might have been clouding his<p></p>
        perception.<p></p>
        Yuuta looked puzzled by Amane's question. "You don't hang out with your friends<p></p>
        because of what you could gain or lose, do you?"<p></p>
        "I guess not, but—"<p></p>
        "Well then, there's your answer. I'm talking to you because I want to get to know you."<p></p>
        Yuuta's smile was like a bright sunny day. Amane squinted at how dazzling it was.<p></p>
        "…Okay," he eventually agreed.<p></p>
        "Yeah, great, I'm glad you're getting along," Itsuki interjected, supplying his thoughts<p></p>
        on the matter with a cheeky grin. Then his gaze quickly shifted to another part of the<p></p>
        classroom.<p></p>
        He was looking at Chitose, who was clinging to Mahiru with a smile, exclaiming,<p></p>
        "You're so sweet and cute, Mahirun, geez!"<p></p>
        Chitose had always been a touchy-feely person, and she didn't seem to care that they<p></p>
        were in class. Everyone was staring, either because they enjoyed seeing two beautiful<p></p>
        girls bonding over some skinship or maybe because they were jealous.<p></p>
        To Amane, it looked like the girls were acting as they always did, but Itsuki grinned as<p></p>
        he watched the two of them joke around.<p></p>
        "Did something happen?"<p></p>
        "Nah, nothing."<p></p>
        Itsuki smiled in amusement and started walking off in the direction of the cafeteria.<p></p>
        Amane and Yuuta followed after him.<p></p>
        After dinner, Amane asked Mahiru "…You're sulking, aren't you?" She had seemed<p></p>
        upset about something lately.<p></p>
        Mahiru blinked dramatically. "…Oh, did it show on my face?" She poked and prodded<p></p>
        at her own cheeks, as if she was just discovering her sour expression.<p></p>
        "Yeah, well, you just look like you're in a bad mood. I've been racking my brain for what<p></p>
        I might have done wrong."<p></p>
        Usually when Mahiru was sulking, it was because Amane had done something. But<p></p>
        today he had barely interacted with her, so he really had no clue what the cause might<p></p>
        be.<p></p>
        "If I did something, I'll apologize, but—"<p></p>
        "N-no, this isn't your fault, Amane. I'm just being narrow-minded."<p></p>
        "If you're narrow-minded, that would mean most people's minds could be measured<p></p>
        in millimeters. Anyway, I'm still not convinced I didn't do something."<p></p>
        There was no way that Mahiru, the girl who basically never got angry, who was always<p></p>
        ready to hear someone out or put herself in another person's shoes, could be
        <p></p>
        narrow-minded. Or if she was, then someone like Amane had to be the narrowest.<p></p>
        He wasn't sure why Mahiru was sulking, but he figured there had to be some reason<p></p>
        for it. And Mahiru wasn't the type of person to let a stranger bother her, so nine times<p></p>
        out of ten, if she was sulking, it meant that Amane, the only boy she let her inside her<p></p>
        guard, was at the root of it all.<p></p>
        "…It really isn't your fault, Amane, but… Well, it does have something to do with you…"<p></p>
        "I don't really understand, but if I'm the reason…"<p></p>
        "You shouldn't apologize when you don't understand why. Actually, I'm probably the<p></p>
        one who should apologize to you."<p></p>
        "Now I'm even more confused."<p></p>
        "It's because I'm so narrow-minded."<p></p>
        "Okay, okay, assuming for the sake of argument that you are narrow-minded, what<p></p>
        exactly is bothering you?"<p></p>
        He didn't think that was even slightly accurate, but for the sake of moving the discussion<p></p>
        forward, he agreed to pretend like it was true.<p></p>
        Mahiru refused to look directly at him.<p></p>
        "…I think it's unfair."<p></p>
        "Unfair?"<p></p>
        "Kadowaki."<p></p>
        "What about him?"<p></p>
        "It's not fair that he can go talk to you whenever, just because you're both boys.<p></p>
        Meanwhile, I still have to hold back."<p></p>
        "Hold back?"<p></p>
        "To avoid causing any trouble… to keep from arousing too many suspicions… to<p></p>
        preserve your precious quiet life, we have to act like strangers at school. But… it's<p></p>
        making me lonely, and I'm the only one left out." 6<p></p>
        She must have been feeling isolated.<p></p>
        At school, Mahiru was still acting like an angel, just as she always had. She gave Amane<p></p>
        the same smile as everyone else and kept him at the same distance she used with all<p></p>
        the other boys. The thoroughness of her act was rather impressive.<p></p>
        But apparently Mahiru wanted to talk to Amane more than usual. She had been<p></p>
        refraining from doing so because it would have all sorts of effects on their school lives,<p></p>
        but now that Yuuta, another popular student who also had problems with the opposite<p></p>
        sex, had made friends with Amane, she was finding her restrictions too limiting.<p></p>
        He hated hearing she was lonely, but he didn't think there was anything they could<p></p>
        really do about that. He frowned, and so did Mahiru. She looked utterly dejected.<p></p>
        "Itsuki and Chitose and Kadowaki—they all get to have fun with you, Amane, but I<p></p>
        alone get left out."<p></p>
        "Argh…"<p></p>
        He couldn't stand hearing her say that with such a sad look on her face.<p></p>
        Amane had always talked to Chitose normally, so he was able to talk to her and Itsuki,<p></p>
        the two people who knew about his friendship with Mahiru, at school like he always<p></p>
        had. But he couldn't talk to Mahiru, so when Chitose came over to talk to Itsuki, that<p></p>
        naturally meant Mahiru was left alone.<p></p>
        She seemed to have some other friends in their class, but she wasn't as open with them<p></p>
        as she was with Chitose, so no matter what, she seemed a little lonely. Of course, she<p></p>
        concealed those roiling emotions behind her angelic smile, but Amane knew her well<p></p>
        enough that her loneliness stood out to him clear as day.<p></p>
        He understood that, and he wished he could do something about it, but of course he<p></p>
        couldn't just nod and say he'd start talking to her whenever she wanted. 7<p></p>
        "…But, well, it would be strange if the class angel suddenly became good friends with<p></p>
        a boring background character like me, wouldn't it?" 5<p></p>
        "Why do you always put yourself down like that? It really bothers me." Mahiru frowned<p></p>
        again and angrily jabbed Amane's nose with the tip of her index finger. "I overheard<p></p>
        the three of you talking today, and you should really stop being so self-deprecating. I<p></p>
        wouldn't even bother making friends with you if everything was really so calculated<p></p>
        and cold. Think about what an absolute slob you were when I first met you. Imagine<p></p>
        how you looked from my perspective. What did I have to gain by getting to know you?"<p></p>
        "You're frighteningly persuasive."<p></p>
        Their friendship had started because Mahiru had felt concerned for Amane,<p></p>
        particularly because of his diet. A dash of guilt may have played a part as well. There<p></p>
        was little other reason for the two of them to get to know each other. Looking at it<p></p>
        objectively, their friendship made no sense.<p></p>
        But they had become friends anyway, and it had nothing to do with either of them<p></p>
        weighing risks against rewards—it was because of the way they felt about each other,<p></p>
        feelings that ranged from happiness to guilt to compassion. Those feelings had been<p></p>
        the spark that led them to get to know each other better.<p></p>
        "Of course, now I know you're a kind person with a good personality, so it would be<p></p>
        an easy exercise if someone asked me to outline the merits of being friends with you,<p></p>
        but I don't care about any of that. I like you for you, and I'm sure Kadowaki has his own<p></p>
        reasons, as he said. So it's not good for you to paint yourself in such a negative light.<p></p>
        That insistence of yours is an insult to all the people who care about you."<p></p>
        "…Sorry."<p></p>
        "You don't need to apologize with such a glum face. I just want you to have more selfconfidence."<p></p>
        He still felt a little sting from being poked at, but that pain wasn't a bad thing.<p></p>
        "Anyway, we've got to work on your low self-esteem. You need to be more confident."<p></p>
        "Confident, huh? Well, see…"<p></p>
        "Even better, I'll start spreading the news that you're a great guy."<p></p>
        "If you do that to me, I'll die of shame, and everyone will wonder what you're talking<p></p>
        about."<p></p>
        It would be sure to raise a lot of suspicions if Mahiru suddenly started praising some<p></p>
        random guy that, as far as their peers were concerned, she didn't really know very<p></p>
        well.<p></p>
        "I'll do my best to make sure it doesn't seem unnatural, okay?"<p></p>
        "I guess that means you've decided you're going to talk to me at school?"<p></p>
        "…Look, I don't like being the only one left out. If you don't mind, I want to spend time<p></p>
        with you just like everybody else."<p></p>
        Whether or not she was aware that Amane found it almost impossible to resist the<p></p>
        disheartened face she was making, Mahiru was casting her eyes low and mumbling<p></p>
        sadly in a way that made him feel like he would go mad.<p></p>
        "…It's not that I hate the idea, but if we suddenly start acting all buddy-buddy, people<p></p>
        are going to notice something's up."<p></p>
        "So if I do it gradually, that's all right?"<p></p>
        There was no way he could reject her any longer once he saw her eyes light up and<p></p>
        her depressed expression change, so Amane nodded in assent.<p></p>
        "Just try not to hype me up too much, okay?"<p></p>
        "Fine… If that's what you want, I'll never compliment you ever again."<p></p>
        It hurt to hear her say that, but Amane held his tongue and just gazed off into the<p></p>
        distance. His school life was about to become a bit stormier.<p></p>
        Chapter 31: : Contact with the Angel and the Reaction from Others<p></p>
        After Mahiru declared her intent to have more frequent contact with Amane, she made<p></p>
        good on her promise and began to approach him more often. At first, this amounted<p></p>
        to nothing more than greetings and small talk, so as not to draw undue attention or<p></p>
        give anyone reasons to think he might be more than a friend of a friend. Mahiru was<p></p>
        obviously taking great care to avoid any sudden disruptions to his daily life.<p></p>
        When they discussed their studies, like classmates often did, they didn't get stares of<p></p>
        jealousy—instead, the other students looked at them with admiration. At times like<p></p>
        these, Amane was grateful that studying came easily to him. Honestly, it was difficult<p></p>
        to keep up with Mahiru, since she usually did the whole year's worth of schoolwork in<p></p>
        advance, but Mahiru was kind enough to tailor the discussion to Amane's level of<p></p>
        understanding, so they were able to play the part of ordinary classmates without any<p></p>
        trouble. It also helped that Chitose and Itsuki, and sometimes even Yuuta, were usually<p></p>
        with them.<p></p>
        In the way that all people ease into gradual change, Amane got used to having light<p></p>
        conversations with Mahiru about daily life or their mutual friends or their classes, and<p></p>
        any looks of jealousy that might have been directed at him from other boys faded into<p></p>
        the background. Only the boys in love with Mahiru continued giving him sharp glares.<p></p>
        "Why Fujimiya…?"<p></p>
        Amane was in his seat in the classroom, staring at his textbooks, when he happened<p></p>
        to overhear some boys sitting near him whispering in resentful tones.<p></p>
        Until just a moment ago, Amane had been discussing the previous class's homework<p></p>
        with Mahiru, and apparently the boys had spotted them.<p></p>
        As for why Mahiru had chosen to have that discussion with Amane, it was because<p></p>
        there simply weren't that many people who could keep up with her on that topic.<p></p>
        Chitose, her closest friend, never prepared for class, so there was no way she really<p></p>
        understood everything they were supposed to be learning right now. Chitose's<p></p>
        boyfriend, Itsuki, was the same.<p></p>
        And so when it came to academic topics, it was easier to talk to Amane. He'd always<p></p>
        had an easy time with schoolwork, and now that he had Mahiru's guidance, he'd<p></p>
        become an even better student than before. This was the power of Mahiru the angel.<p></p>
        "What do you mean, why me?" Amane answered loudly. "I happen to be able to follow<p></p>
        along with what she's talking about. It's not like we were having some hot-and-heavy<p></p>
        conversation over here."<p></p>
        When it came to interactions with Mahiru at school, there was some occasional small<p></p>
        talk, but it was mostly about their studies.<p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to be taking her time approaching him, so no one would suspect<p></p>
        anything, and was careful not to talk about anything normal classmates wouldn't share.<p></p>
        Rather, they had been having conversations befitting exemplary students, serious<p></p>
        conversations that left no room for doubt.<p></p>
        "I guess that's probably true, but…"<p></p>
        "If you've got a problem with it, you guys should get to studying and come join the<p></p>
        discussion," Amane continued. "Having you guys look at me all jealous is a real pain.<p></p>
        Studying is what we're here to do."<p></p>
        "Huh, no way… I don't get that stuff… I already have no idea what you two were even<p></p>
        talking about…"<p></p>
        "Just read the textbook," Amane admonished. "All we're doing is looking ahead of the<p></p>
        material we're learning now. If that's impossible for you, then I don't know what to say<p></p>
        other than give up now."<p></p>
        "That's harsh…"<p></p>
        "Don't blame me for the sorry state of your studies. And anyway, I don't know what 1<p></p>
        you guys are thinking, but I'm not that close with Shiina."<p></p>
        Amane answered them dispassionately, and the other boys ground their teeth in<p></p>
        frustration. He wasn't particularly good friends with any of them—in fact, he saw<p></p>
        them all as enemies who might discover his relationship with Mahiru—so he felt no<p></p>
        obligation to be overly accommodating.<p></p>
        Mahiru was only starting with light, casual conversation as a way to steadily work up<p></p>
        to being his friend openly at school. That meant they talked about schoolwork a lot,<p></p>
        but even if any of these other boys were on top of their studies, he doubted whether<p></p>
        she would befriend any of them.<p></p>
        Amane did his best to look utterly disinterested, but the two boys who were speaking<p></p>
        to him stared at him suspiciously.<p></p>
        "You… you don't seem bothered by the fact that you and Shiina only talk about school<p></p>
        stuff…"<p></p>
        "Don't you have any interest in the angel, Fujimiya?"<p></p>
        "Not in the angel, no."<p></p>
        Amane hadn't fallen for the "angel." That wasn't a lie.<p></p>
        The one he loved wasn't the angel—it was the real Mahiru, the side of her she only let<p></p>
        him see. He loved the Mahiru who could be infuriatingly stubborn and sarcastic but<p></p>
        was also tenderhearted and shy, the one who tended to indulge him, who had a<p></p>
        penchant for feeling lonely, and who sometimes looked so fragile he worried she might<p></p>
        break into a million pieces.<p></p>
        According to Mahiru, the angel persona was like a combat uniform she put on to go<p></p>
        outside, a set of armor she wore to protect her vulnerable interior. And it wasn't as if<p></p>
        he loved the armor. Of course, after all was said and done, that didn't change the fact<p></p>
        that he liked Mahiru, but it was for more than just her public facade.<p></p>
        The two boys now seemed suspicious of how readily Amane had shut that line of<p></p>
        questioning down. He dismissed without hesitation the idea that he was interested in<p></p>
        the angel, and they looked at him in disbelief.<p></p>
        "…You're telling me you don't think she's cute, Fujimiya?"<p></p>
