        <p></p>"Well, I can't help it if other people fall for me."
        <p></p>"And what if I fall in love?"
        <p></p>"…I'll let you stare as much as you want," Mahiru teased,
        <p></p>smiling impishly.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Well then, I'll have to look to my heart's content once
        <p></p>we're home." Amane smiled, too, and pulled her by the hand
        <p></p>into a nearby park.
        <p></p>The park was relatively spacious, with lots of greenery, so
        <p></p>it was a place where people in the neighborhood came to
        <p></p>relax.
        <p></p>In the large sandpit, kids played in the sand, screeching in
        <p></p>their high-pitched voices, or took turns going down the slide
        <p></p>that was next to the jungle gym. Their parents watched them
        <p></p>from nearby benches and sometimes got up to play with
        <p></p>their children.
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru smiled a little at the very mundane,
        <p></p>yet charming, scene.
        <p></p>"They're all so lively," she said.
        <p></p>"They look that way because we're not as energetic. We
        <p></p>can't run around like that anymore."
        <p></p>"You never liked running anyway, did you, Amane?"
        <p></p>"No, I don't mind it. I just hate it when we have to run at a
        <p></p>particular pace, like in gym class."
        <p></p>Plenty of people disliked gym. Not all of them hated
        <p></p>exercise, they just didn't like being forced to do it in front of 1
        <p></p>others. Amane was like that. On his own, and moving at his
        <p></p>own pace, he actually enjoyed exercising. He just hated the
        <p></p>class.
        <p></p>"Hmm, maybe I'll go play with the children," Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"That might look weird, and you're not really dressed for
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>it. Besides… What am I supposed to do while you leave me
        <p></p>here?"
        <p></p>"You're right… But I think it looks kind of nice. I never got
        <p></p>to play like that when I was little, so…"
        <p></p>Mahiru added that she had mostly played alone in her
        <p></p>garden, and Amane squeezed her small hand again.
        <p></p>"…Still, maybe not right now, but, well, how do I put it? …
        <p></p>Someday, I hope we do have a chance to play here." 5
        <p></p>"Huh? O-okay…?" 3
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't really seem to understand what Amane
        <p></p>meant. But he didn't mind that she hadn't caught on to what
        <p></p>he was implying. He figured they had plenty of time to talk 2
        <p></p>about that sort of thing later, well after high school was over. 2
        <p></p>He didn't need to pressure Mahiru into thinking about a
        <p></p>future family—and anyway, he didn't think she would turn 2
        <p></p>him down.
        <p></p>Mahiru had tilted her head in confusion, so Amane smiled
        <p></p>and gently tugged at her hand. Staying in the shade as much
        <p></p>as possible, they slowly walked through the park relaxing
        <p></p>while gazing at the flowers blooming in the flowerbeds and
        <p></p>enjoying the refreshing breeze that blew through the gaps in
        <p></p>the trees.
        <p></p>Occasionally, one of the married women from the
        <p></p>neighborhood would greet him as she passed. "Oh, aren't
        <p></p>you the Fujimiya boy?" The women would smile and wish
        <p></p>him well. It wasn't unpleasant, but it was rather awkward.
        <p></p>The two of them ambled around for a long time and
        <p></p>eventually decided to take a break. They purchased drinks
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>from a vending machine and settled down on a bench in the
        <p></p>shade.
        <p></p>"Come to think of it, you're already totally used to my
        <p></p>parents' house, aren't you, Mahiru?" Amane asked after
        <p></p>taking a swig of his sports drink.
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked her caramel-colored eyes several times in
        <p></p>surprise at the abrupt change in topic, then her face softened
        <p></p>into a smile.
        <p></p>"Yes, I am, thanks to you all."
        <p></p>"Actually, you fit in better than I do."
        <p></p>"I—I do?"
        <p></p>"You do. Like it's already your home."
        <p></p>Mahiru blended in so well into the Fujimiya household
        <p></p>that it was almost like she had belonged there from the
        <p></p>beginning. Of course, Amane's parents were always
        <p></p>affectionate, but Mahiru seemed to receive special attention. 1
        <p></p>Even without Amane around, his parents doted on her so
        <p></p>much it was like she was already their favorite daughter.
        <p></p>Mahiru, for her part, seemed to be growing more
        <p></p>comfortable in their home.
        <p></p>"Are you enjoying your time at my house?" he asked.
        <p></p>"Yes. Heh-heh, it's really been nothing but fun since I
        <p></p>arrived at the Fujimiya household. Your parents have been
        <p></p>so kind to me."
        <p></p>"They're doting on you even more than I do."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Amane, you mustn't pout."
        <p></p>"I'm not pouting. Not while you're with me."
        <p></p>"…Okay."
        <p></p>Amane was glad to see that Mahiru was being welcomed
        <p></p>into his home, even if it did mean that he was somewhat
        <p></p>neglected. He was hopeful that eventually she might one day
        <p></p>become a permanent member of the family.
        <p></p>Amane was happy as long as Mahiru was with him, and
        <p></p>she had already shown him that she would always come back
        <p></p>to him. So he didn't have a problem with his parents
        <p></p>monopolizing her a bit. And he knew that once they returned
        <p></p>to their apartments, he would be able to have her all to
        <p></p>himself again.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed embarrassed by Amane's words, and she
        <p></p>pressed her forehead against his arm to hide her face. He
        <p></p>reached out to stroke her hair, thinking that she was so cute
        <p></p>when she did that.
        <p></p>"…Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>His hand stopped at the sound of someone's voice calling
        <p></p>out to him.
        <p></p>When he looked up, he noticed someone else nearby. He
        <p></p>had been so absorbed in his conversation with Mahiru that
        <p></p>he hadn't seen the other person approaching.
        <p></p>Oh, that's right, I knew there was a chance I would see
        <p></p>him if I came home.
        <p></p>The voice belonged to someone Amane had tried for the
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>longest time to forget, even avoiding him in his dreams. He 1
        <p></p>had left his hometown to get away from that person,
        <p></p>although he'd always known that they might run into each
        <p></p>other again someday.
        <p></p>In the recesses of his heart, Amane had been anticipating
        <p></p>their meeting.
        <p></p>This time, however, Mahiru was there beside him, and
        <p></p>Amane stayed calm and composed. He took a deep breath,
        <p></p>letting his hand fall, and turned to face the voice—to face a
        <p></p>boy who stood at the center of so many memories. 2

        <p></p>Chapter 68: Farewell to the Past
        <p></p>"It really is you, Fujimiya! I didn't know who you were for
        <p></p>a second until I heard your name!" the boy who used to be
        <p></p>Amane's friend said.
        <p></p>Toujou, who Amane no longer considered a friend, stood 1
        <p></p>there staring at him. The last time Amane had seen Toujou's
        <p></p>face was at their middle school graduation, and his
        <p></p>appearance and attitude hadn't changed much since then.
        <p></p>On the other hand, Amane had changed a lot, on the
        <p></p>outside and inside, over the two years that had passed since
        <p></p>they had their falling out. And he had styled his hair and
        <p></p>dressed up for the day's outing, so he certainly ought to have
        <p></p>been difficult to recognize.
        <p></p>Ever since he had made his relationship with Mahiru
        <p></p>official, Amane had felt like anybody who had known him
        <p></p>before would scarcely believe that he was the same person.
        <p></p>There was nothing surprising about Toujou's reaction.
        <p></p>Toujou wore the same irreverent smile he always had.
        <p></p>Like Itsuki, he was a flashy, confident guy, but they didn't
        <p></p>have anything in common otherwise. Sure, Itsuki liked to
        <p></p>joke around, despite looking like a fresh-faced, agreeable
        <p></p>young man. But Toujou had a genuinely cruel sense of
        <p></p>humor.
        <p></p>At first, Toujou seemed a little uncomfortable with
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane's lack of response, but right away he broke into a
        <p></p>broad smile.
        <p></p>"It's been a long time, huh, Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"Yes, it has."
        <p></p>"You left home, didn't you? You're back now?"
        <p></p>"It's summer vacation, so I'm just visiting," Amane
        <p></p>answered smoothly. "Glad to see you're looking well."
        <p></p>He had been able to answer more steadily than he would
        <p></p>have expected, probably because he was surprised but not
        <p></p>shaken.
        <p></p>Amane had already prepared himself for this possibility.
        <p></p>His former friends still lived in their hometown, so of course
        <p></p>they would be around. It was pure chance that he had run
        <p></p>into one of them like this, but now that he did not live near
        <p></p>them, they were mere strangers with whom he had no real
        <p></p>connection.
        <p></p>There was one small twinge of resentment in his chest
        <p></p>when he thought of the past, but when he felt Mahiru's
        <p></p>warmth by his side, that unhappiness seemed to dissolve.
        <p></p>"So what's with the girl?" Toujou asked. "Don't tell me
        <p></p>you're out here picking up chicks?"
        <p></p>"Of course not; no way. This is my girlfriend."
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>Toujou gave Mahiru an appraising look. He didn't appear
        <p></p>too amused by the word girlfriend.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Toujou had an expression that Amane had seen
        <p></p>sometimes when they'd been friends. He knew what that
        <p></p>look meant right away.
        <p></p>It was the face Toujou made when someone else had
        <p></p>something that he didn't have.
        <p></p>"Aren't you all grown-up, with your girlfriend? The
        <p></p>crybaby with the cute face turned into a man after all, huh?"
        <p></p>Toujou smirked as he teased him, but Amane didn't think
        <p></p>much of it.
        <p></p>Amane had expected the words to hurt, but he didn't feel
        <p></p>a thing. It was like a gentle breeze had blown past, no force
        <p></p>behind it at all. Instead, he was more worried about whether
        <p></p>Mahiru was getting angry at Toujou's mockery.
        <p></p>He glanced over and saw Mahiru blinking.
        <p></p>Then she broke into a broad smile.
        <p></p>Mahiru's smiles came in several different varieties, but
        <p></p>despite their close relationship, Amane didn't recognize the
        <p></p>one she was wearing. It was different from the smile she had
        <p></p>worn when Amane had been belittled on Sports Day and
        <p></p>from the one she had used on the guys who had tried to pick
        <p></p>her up at the pool. The emotions behind this smile were
        <p></p>unreadable. Amane felt a little uneasy seeing it. He wasn't
        <p></p>sure if he should be relieved or worried.
        <p></p>Toujou, on the other hand, grinned with satisfaction.
        <p></p>"So, new girlfriend, did you know this? Amane's not too
        <p></p>bad-looking now, but years ago everyone used to tease him
        <p></p>for having a girly face until he cried."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>The malicious words didn't surprise Amane in the least.
        <p></p>"How very nostalgic," he muttered.
        <p></p>With Mahiru beside him, holding his hand, Amane
        <p></p>thought that, in the end, Toujou was just another ordinary
        <p></p>guy from his past.
        <p></p>Toujou had always been physically bigger than Amane,
        <p></p>and smart and cheerful, the kind of guy who always said
        <p></p>what was on his mind. And he'd always had lots of friends.
        <p></p>That made it much harder for Amane when Toujou, with his
        <p></p>many advantages, betrayed him and bad-mouthed Amane
        <p></p>behind his back. Amane had suffered terribly because of
        <p></p>Toujou's abuse.
        <p></p>Now his mind was calm. It wasn't that he didn't care, but
        <p></p>rather that he felt as if he had gained more perspective.
        <p></p>Things like that happened, and faced with it now, Amane did
        <p></p>not flinch or tremble like he had back then. 1
        <p></p>Toujou's cheeks reddened slightly, and his gaze grew
        <p></p>sharp. He seemed rattled by Amane's composed response.
        <p></p>"You seem awfully calm… Hey, girlfriend, what do you see
        <p></p>in a guy like this? His only redeeming feature is his family.
        <p></p>Do you know how uncool he used to look?"
        <p></p>Toujou switched his focus to Mahiru and started talking
        <p></p>to her, but she looked back at him with her unchanging
        <p></p>gentle smile.
        <p></p>"I've heard everything from Amane already. Although, I
        <p></p>didn't know that he had such a cute face and everything…"
        <p></p>"I didn't tell you because then you'd want to see the
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>photos."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, I've already seen them, though… And they were
        <p></p>adorable," Mahiru added in a quiet voice.
        <p></p>Amane shot her an exasperated look, and she responded
        <p></p>with an honest smile for just a moment before reverting to
        <p></p>her inscrutable angelic visage.
        <p></p>Amane smirked a little at Toujou, who was frozen in place
        <p></p>for a second by Mahiru's smile.
        <p></p>"I don't really care; you can say whatever you like. It's just
        <p></p>your perception. I'm not afraid of you anymore, and I'm 2
        <p></p>confident that my girlfriend's feelings aren't going to change
        <p></p>because of something bad you say about me."
        <p></p>Amane had nothing to fear from Toujou, because now he
        <p></p>had a loving and supportive partner. The past was behind 1
        <p></p>him, and it was nothing more than a healed wound.
        <p></p>He had the love of his life by his side and wasn't afraid of
        <p></p>anything.
        <p></p>"As far as I'm concerned, everything that happened back
        <p></p>then is over, Toujou."
        <p></p>So no matter what you say, it can't hurt me—that was the
        <p></p>meaning behind the look in his eyes as he stared at Toujou
        <p></p>calmly.
        <p></p>Toujou's eyes bulged as he appeared irritated by Amane's
        <p></p>placid demeanor. But before he could open his mouth,
        <p></p>Mahiru opened hers.
        <p></p>"…Come to think of it, you were asking what I see in him,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>weren't you?"
        <p></p>Mahiru stood up beside Amane, stretched to her full
        <p></p>height, and stared Toujou down. He winced ever so slightly
        <p></p>in the face of her captivating intensity.
        <p></p>Her eyes weren't cold so much as lacking in warmth, and
        <p></p>her calm, but keen, sharp gaze bored into Toujou.
        <p></p>"Do you choose who you associate with based on money?
        <p></p>Do you pick your friends by whether they have any value?
        <p></p>You'll never get a single thing you want by choosing like
        <p></p>that, and I doubt you'll ever be satisfied."
        <p></p>"Wha…?"
        <p></p>"I have money, but I've never truly been satisfied… I have
        <p></p>money, but my heart was always cold," Mahiru said quietly,
        <p></p>gently placing her hand over her heart.
        <p></p>Amane felt a tight pressure building in his chest.
        <p></p>As far as social standing, Mahiru was surely blessed. Her
        <p></p>household was wealthy enough to employ a housekeeper,
        <p></p>and everything she owned was high quality. She had told
        <p></p>him that the only thing her parents gave her was money. For
        <p></p>that reason, Mahiru didn't attach much importance to
        <p></p>wealth. Rather, she sought human warmth instead.
        <p></p>Toujou hadn't been able to hurt Amane, but he felt pain in
        <p></p>his chest when he thought about Mahiru's circumstances,
        <p></p>which showed how little Toujou mattered to him now.
        <p></p>"When I met Amane, my heart was filled with happiness
        <p></p>for the first time. So what I see in him doesn't have anything
        <p></p>to do with money or even looks. It's what's inside that
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>matters. I don't think anything else is important," Mahiru
        <p></p>asserted.
        <p></p>Without pitying or dismissing Toujou, she held his
        <p></p>reflection in her intently calm eyes. "If wealth is all that
        <p></p>matters to you, that's fine, I suppose," she continued. "I'm 2
        <p></p>not trying to deny other people's priorities in life. But to me,
        <p></p>Amane has more value than any other person, and as long as
        <p></p>he understands that, it's good enough for me."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Her angelic smile transformed into her true smile as she
        <p></p>looked at Amane.
        <p></p>That brought him great relief.
        <p></p>"That's plenty, Mahiru," Amane said.
        <p></p>"But—"
        <p></p>"No, listen, I'm getting really embarrassed from hearing
        <p></p>you say all that…but it does make me happy. You can tell me
        <p></p>all that stuff when we're alone together."
        <p></p>"…Okay."
        <p></p>If he'd let her, Mahiru would have probably moved on to
        <p></p>listing everything she liked about Amane. But her
        <p></p>enchanting smiles were wasted on Toujou, who was less
        <p></p>than a stranger to him now.
        <p></p>"Thank you," he whispered quietly as he stood up and
        <p></p>took a step to stand in front of Mahiru.
        <p></p>Facing Toujou now, everything that had happened before
        <p></p>seemed very distant. Years ago, Toujou had seemed so
        <p></p>dazzling and huge, he had looked so frightening, but Amane
        <p></p>had grown a lot, physically and mentally, and he wasn't
        <p></p>afraid of him anymore.
        <p></p>He didn't have to look up at him anymore, either. When
        <p></p>Amane straightened up and faced Toujou, he actually had to
        <p></p>look down a little. Amane didn't tremble in the least, even
        <p></p>with Toujou staring right at him.
        <p></p>"Toujou," Amane said his name quietly.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Wh-what is it?" came the flustered response. 3
        <p></p>…I really have gotten past it, huh? 1
        <p></p>Amane didn't feel anything looking at Toujou. He really
        <p></p>had let go of the past. Amane was calm, something he never
        <p></p>could have imagined when he left his hometown because he
        <p></p>feared confronting the other boy.
        <p></p>Behind him, Mahiru sensed Amane's mood and didn't try
        <p></p>to stop him.
        <p></p>I guess it's time to make a stand.
        <p></p>A stand against the past that I tried to ignore, and
        <p></p>against Toujou, the symbol of it all, and against the weak
        <p></p>version of me who was hurt back then.
        <p></p>In a certain sense, coming back home may have been
        <p></p>fate. It gave me the chance to put these things behind me.
        <p></p>Toujou looked flustered at Amane's cool demeanor. He
        <p></p>looked like he was wondering what Amane was going to say.
        <p></p>Seeing Toujou like that, Amane smiled a little. 5
        <p></p>"At this point, I feel kind of grateful to you. You used me
        <p></p>and afterward cut me off, but even so, I had some fun back
        <p></p>then, and I enjoyed your company."
        <p></p>Amane didn't have any intention of airing his grievances
        <p></p>to Toujou. In the past, he had been hurt and had suffered—
        <p></p>but he had learned, since then, to accept it as just another
        <p></p>kind of experience. One that had been a key part of his
        <p></p>development.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane liked who he was now. He'd met Mahiru and
        <p></p>started a wonderful relationship.
        <p></p>"So in the end, I'm glad I spent time with you guys.
        <p></p>Because of it, I was able to meet Mahiru. Actually, I think
        <p></p>you using me was good for both of us. You did hurt me, but I
        <p></p>think I probably became a bigger person because I was able
        <p></p>to overcome what happened. It was hard, but I found
        <p></p>something important, and it's all thanks to you guys."
        <p></p>In a certain sense, Toujou, and the rest of Amane's former
        <p></p>friends who were not present, had been major factors that
        <p></p>had led him to Mahiru.
        <p></p>And now they were no more and no less.
        <p></p>"Thank you… Now, I've got nothing more to do with you
        <p></p>and nothing else to talk about, so that's all I have to say." 1
        <p></p>His words of thanks were also words of parting.
        <p></p>Amane didn't have any desire or even a reason to get
        <p></p>involved with Toujou. Amane lived in another town and
        <p></p>went to another school. He was planning to go to university
        <p></p>there, too. Attending different schools, they would go on to
        <p></p>live in different places and learn different things. Toujou was
        <p></p>just someone he used to be friends with and was now a
        <p></p>stranger.
        <p></p>Toujou stiffened as if he had been hit by a bolt of lightning 4
        <p></p>when he heard these words coming straight from Amane's
        <p></p>heart.
        <p></p>Amane turned his back to him.
        <p></p>All the lingering discomfort he felt toward the other boy
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>had melted away.
        <p></p>"Well, Mahiru, shall we go?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>"Mm."
        <p></p>He took Mahiru's hand, feeling faintly embarrassed.
        <p></p>Mahiru had already lost any interest in Toujou and was
        <p></p>looking only at Amane.
        <p></p>Amane gave Mahiru a small, wry smile, and without
        <p></p>looking back, as if he did not care for the former friend who
        <p></p>was not yet far behind, they left the park together.
        <p></p>That evening, Amane closed his eyes in bed and waited for
        <p></p>sleep to find him. But as he lay there, he did not feel sleepy.
        <p></p>Amane usually never had trouble falling asleep, but that
        <p></p>night he couldn't even catch a moment's rest. He was
        <p></p>strangely alert.
        <p></p>He knew it was probably because of his encounter with
        <p></p>Toujou earlier in the day.
        <p></p>His former friend was one of the people who had caused
        <p></p>Amane a lot of heartache, but Amane no longer held even a
        <p></p>small fragment of ill feeling or uneasiness in his heart
        <p></p>toward those boys.
        <p></p>He felt refreshed after encountering Toujou and even a
        <p></p>little emotional over it.
        <p></p>Meeting Mahiru and spending time with her, earning her
        <p></p>trust and support, had helped him grow a lot. He felt
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>indescribably moved by it.
        <p></p>…I'm glad I got out of this town like Dad suggested.
        <p></p>If he had remained there, Amane would have never gotten
        <p></p>over his past and wouldn't have matured like he had. He
        <p></p>probably would have pretended not to see his pain and
        <p></p>would have lived his whole life trying to ignore it.
        <p></p>Everything was thanks to Mahiru, Itsuki, and the rest of
        <p></p>them. Gratitude toward his friends and the pleasant
        <p></p>realization that he had finally overcome his past filled
        <p></p>Amane's chest.
        <p></p>But it didn't seem like he was going to get any sleep. So
        <p></p>Amane decided to take in the outside air and got up, put on
        <p></p>his slippers, and went out onto the veranda.
        <p></p>The moment he opened the door, the hot, uncomfortably
        <p></p>humid air rushed into the air-conditioned room behind him.
        <p></p>It was nighttime, but the evenings had been sweltering for
        <p></p>several days in a row.
        <p></p>Even so, the sky was clear, and he could easily see the
        <p></p>stars now that he was away from the lights of the city. It was
        <p></p>the perfect setting to kill time and boredom until he got
        <p></p>sleepy.
        <p></p>While Amane was leaning against the railing, enjoying the
        <p></p>quiet atmosphere and the twinkling of the stars, there was a
        <p></p>sudden sound of a sliding door being opened.
        <p></p>It wasn't coming from his own room. When he turned
        <p></p>toward the noise that came from the other room connected
        <p></p>to the veranda, he saw Mahiru dressed in a long nightgown,
        <p></p>poking half her body out to look at him.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Mahiru, you're still awake?"
        <p></p>He had never expected her to still be up.
        <p></p>The night was late, and his family was fast asleep, plus
        <p></p>Mahiru had told him that she kept a regular schedule and
        <p></p>always went to sleep before midnight. It was surprising that
        <p></p>she was still up—and moreover that she would step out onto
        <p></p>the balcony.
        <p></p>"Somehow, I just couldn't sleep… What about you,
        <p></p>Amane? I guess you couldn't, either, huh?"
        <p></p>"Mm… There was a lot of stuff on my mind."
        <p></p>"…I guess so."
        <p></p>Mahiru was out on the veranda now, too, and she cast her
        <p></p>eyes slightly downward when she heard him say those
        <p></p>words, so Amane smiled wryly. "It's not that I'm not over
        <p></p>what happened, you know? I think it was just a lot for me to
        <p></p>come face-to-face with those strong feelings and realize how
        <p></p>much I've matured."
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't need to worry about that.
        <p></p>He wasn't thinking about Toujou anymore. He was just
        <p></p>appreciating how much he had changed. Toujou's face
        <p></p>hadn't so much as flitted through his mind. Amane wasn't
        <p></p>threatened by him anymore.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked relieved when Amane told her this with a
        <p></p>smile, and she put on a small one of her own.
        <p></p>"Heh-heh… You've become stronger, Amane, and grown
        <p></p>up, too. Not to mention, it sounds like you've gotten a lot
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>taller since middle school."
        <p></p>"Mm, I guess so. I've grown about twenty centimeters
        <p></p>since my first year of middle school."
        <p></p>"That's amazing."
        <p></p>"Yeah."
        <p></p>Amane had definitely changed. His height was one thing,
        <p></p>but in the past year, his mental state and his perspective on
        <p></p>everything had shifted, too.
        <p></p>Thinking about it now, he saw that in the past he had
        <p></p>been unsociable, cynical, and rude. His former friends
        <p></p>hadn't been entirely at fault, but it was still a fact that
        <p></p>Amane had not made it easy for anyone to get to know him.
        <p></p>He thought his current self was more composed than
        <p></p>before.
        <p></p>The reason for that composure was because of the beloved
        <p></p>girl by his side.
        <p></p>"It's like you said, Amane. You have matured. Mentally
        <p></p>and physically."
        <p></p>"…I guess I have."
        <p></p>"You're more confident now, right?"
        <p></p>"Yeah."
        <p></p>"That's good, then. Even if you lose your confidence, I'll
        <p></p>support you."
        <p></p>"I'm grateful for that, truly."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled gently and looked at the sky, placing her
        <p></p>hands on the railing beside him. Her loveliness threatened
        <p></p>to overwhelm him.
        <p></p>Mahiru nestled close to Amane and smiled. By his side,
        <p></p>she supported him. She encouraged him. This incredibly
        <p></p>lovely, precious person wanted to be with him.
        <p></p>"…Hey, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Yes?"
        <p></p>"…I want to touch you." 3
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>Mahiru turned slowly toward him at these abrupt words.
        <p></p>She looked surprised, mostly, and Amane felt embarrassed,
        <p></p>but he didn't want to retract his request. He stared into
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes as she shook with bewilderment.
        <p></p>"…I feel like I want to touch you; is that bad?"
        <p></p>He very much wanted to.
        <p></p>He wanted to feel the warmth of this girl who loved him,
        <p></p>cared for him, and supported him. He wanted time to really
        <p></p>appreciate her being there with him.
        <p></p>Under Amane's direct stare, her caramel-colored eyes
        <p></p>wavered, then looked down in embarrassment.
        <p></p>"…It's not bad," she answered quietly.
        <p></p>Amane felt the warmth within his chest grow again.
        <p></p>As he was still taking in Mahiru's acceptance, Amane
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>extended a hand toward her.
        <p></p>But he was hesitant to embrace her there on the veranda,
        <p></p>so he just touched her palm.
        <p></p>As they walked together, Amane took her hand, which was
        <p></p>so delicate, yet had always encouraged him and guided him.
        <p></p>He led her into his room.
        <p></p>It was late at night, so he closed the door quietly, and
        <p></p>Mahiru sat down on the bed.
        <p></p>There was no sofa in the room, so the bed was the only
        <p></p>place for her to sit. But the moment she sat down, Mahiru's
        <p></p>body stiffened, and she looked at him awkwardly, which
        <p></p>made him smile in spite of himself.
        <p></p>"I'm not going to do anything," he assured her.
        <p></p>"O-okay."
        <p></p>"Were you expecting me to?"
        <p></p>"Th-that's not what I thought at all."
        <p></p>"In that case, I have some complicated feelings, as a man."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"Just joking… Right now, I just want to feel you, Mahiru." 2
        <p></p>Mahiru looked nervous for a second, but Amane wasn't
        <p></p>intending to do anything that she had to worry about. He
        <p></p>wanted her full consent—when she was ready to give it. He
        <p></p>would never force her into anything.
        <p></p>Mahiru finally relaxed, and Amane slowly wrapped his
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>arms around her. She returned the embrace, and his chest
        <p></p>steadily filled with indescribable euphoria from her softness
        <p></p>and familiar sweet smell. Feeling the love well up inside him
        <p></p>again, he squeezed Mahiru tight to have his fill of her.
        <p></p>In his arms, Mahiru closed her eyes pleasantly.
        <p></p>She didn't say out loud that she was happy, but a satisfied
        <p></p>smile crept across her face, and she seemed content, so
        <p></p>Amane was sure that Mahiru felt the same way he did.
        <p></p>…I love her so much…
        <p></p>Day by day, the feelings deep in his heart keep growing,
        <p></p>filling him with passion and joy from head to toe.
        <p></p>Even when he thought he couldn't possibly love Mahiru
        <p></p>any more, his feelings grew steadily stronger and more
        <p></p>ardent, and he knew they would probably never disappear.
        <p></p>Just like his parents, his feelings of love would only deepen.
        <p></p>His love would be gentle, elegant, and dazzling, and it could
        <p></p>transform into a deeper love that would never fade or
        <p></p>dissipate.
        <p></p>He loved her, truly from the bottom of his heart.
        <p></p>Filled with irrepressible emotion, Amane spontaneously
        <p></p>lifted Mahiru's chin and gave her beguiling lips a kiss. 9
        <p></p>He saw her caramel-colored eyes blink dramatically up
        <p></p>close. Then, the next moment, a dull pain hit his forehead.
        <p></p>He pulled his face away from the impact.
        <p></p>This time it was Amane's turn to blink, as he recoiled from
        <p></p>the steadily spreading pain. Mahiru, the probable source,
        <p></p>looked obviously bewildered, her eyes wavering unsteadily.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Ow!"
        <p></p>"S-sorry! You surprised me."
        <p></p>"N-no, I'm the one who suddenly… I'm sorry."
        <p></p>He realized she had bumped into him in her surprise, and
        <p></p>he couldn't possibly blame her. He was the one who had
        <p></p>kissed her without her permission.
        <p></p>From Mahiru's reaction, Amane thought regretfully that
        <p></p>he ought to have held out a little bit longer. Her eyes darted
        <p></p>around the room, and she hunched over.
        <p></p>"I—I didn't dislike it, so…you just really startled me, is
        <p></p>all… Um… T-try once more, please. It'll be all right this 2
        <p></p>time."
        <p></p>Her shy voice trembled, but she squeezed her eyes shut
        <p></p>and turned her face upward, arranging herself into a posture
        <p></p>ready to accept a kiss. Amane smiled a little and obliged her.
        <p></p>With no bump on the head to drive him back, he took
        <p></p>advantage of the fact that Mahiru was accepting the kiss to
        <p></p>really savor it.
        <p></p>Her lips were softer and juicier than his own. 7
        <p></p>He was suddenly worried about whether his own lips were
        <p></p>dry and causing Mahiru any discomfort, but she didn't seem
        <p></p>displeased, not that he could see. She was shaking a little as
        <p></p>if he was tickling her as he nibbled at her softly, and he
        <p></p>found her indescribably precious.
        <p></p>He pulled away for a moment, but Mahiru was so cute,
        <p></p>and his desire to continue overruled his self-control, so he
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>pressed his lips against hers again.
        <p></p>He heard a muffled groan and couldn't tell if it was
        <p></p>conveying surprise or objection, but in an attempt to soothe
        <p></p>her, he gently caressed her lips, then settled into giving her
        <p></p>lots of little pecks.
        <p></p>Sometimes he garnished his kisses with small happy
        <p></p>sounds.
        <p></p>He narrowed his eyes, thinking how cute she was, and
        <p></p>gently kissed her repeatedly, holding her petite body in his
        <p></p>arms.
        <p></p>After tasting her lips again and again, he eventually did
        <p></p>pull away, and Mahiru buried her face in Amane's shoulder.
        <p></p>"…Y-you didn't ask me if you could do it so many times."
        <p></p>"D-did you hate it?"
        <p></p>"N-no. I just wasn't ready…and I'm embarrassed, is all…
        <p></p>It's my first time," she whispered quietly.
        <p></p>Amane heard another meaning in those words, and his
        <p></p>heart skipped a beat.
        <p></p>"…Amane, was that really your first kiss? You seemed
        <p></p>more confident than me." 1
        <p></p>"Not at all… I just—I wanted to kiss you so much I
        <p></p>couldn't stand it, so maybe I was a bit pushy…"
        <p></p>"N-no, it wasn't bad… I knew you were going to do it, so it
        <p></p>was fine… D-do it some more now," she said with her eyes 9
        <p></p>turned upward. Not even Amane was enough of a wimp to
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>refuse her.
        <p></p>Even as he kissed Mahiru again, he tried to match her
        <p></p>pace and forced himself to take it slow. He placed his palm
        <p></p>on the back of Mahiru's head, and she didn't pull away.
        <p></p>When Amane shifted to get a better angle to enjoy her soft
        <p></p>lips, he noticed his heart beating so hard it was practically
        <p></p>deafening.
        <p></p>"…Heh-heh." Mahiru laughed quietly in the interval
        <p></p>between kisses and placed her hand on Amane's chest.
        <p></p>Holding Amane at bay, she looked up at him. "…Before I fell
        <p></p>for you, Amane, I wondered what the point of kissing was.
        <p></p>But as someone who loves you from the bottom of my heart,
        <p></p>it makes me incredibly happy."
        <p></p>"…Are you happy now?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>"…Me too."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, then we agree."
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed embarrassed, but she put on a carefree
        <p></p>smile. He kissed her once more, and as he was tasting the
        <p></p>slight sweetness of her lips, he felt her body tremble slightly.
        <p></p>Worried he had made her uncomfortable, he backed away,
        <p></p>but Mahiru smiled awkwardly. "It's fine"—she drew her body
        <p></p>in closer to him—"you're nice and warm," she whispered.
        <p></p>"…Are you cold?"
        <p></p>"I guess I am; the timer on the air conditioner doesn't
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>seem to have cut off yet, so…"
        <p></p>The air-conditioning was actually set to a higher
        <p></p>temperature than it was during the day, but even so, the
        <p></p>room was fairly chilly. It would shut off eventually, several
        <p></p>hours after they went to sleep, but at the moment, Mahiru
        <p></p>must have been cold in her thin nightgown. 2
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>After all, her arms were exposed in short sleeves. It was
        <p></p>no wonder she was freezing.
        <p></p>"If you like, maybe I could warm you up?" 5
        <p></p>"Oh, would you please?"
        <p></p>He had asked in jest, but Mahiru unexpectedly took him
        <p></p>up on the offer.
        <p></p>"What do you want me to do?"
        <p></p>"What do you think I want you to do?"
        <p></p>"I wonder, what could it be?"
        <p></p>"Take your best guess."
        <p></p>"…You're not gonna let me off easy, eh, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, not this time."
        <p></p>"Sure, sure. All right then, how about I do this, since that's
        <p></p>how you're going to be?"
        <p></p>Still holding Mahiru tight, Amane fell over onto the bed.
        <p></p>In his arms, flaxen hair fluttered down softly, and
        <p></p>caramel-colored eyes opened wide in surprise.
        <p></p>After kissing Mahiru's cheek again when she was frozen
        <p></p>stiff, Amane covered their bodies with the large terry cloth
        <p></p>blanket draped over the side of the bed. Finally seeming to
        <p></p>realize what had happened, Mahiru brought her face closer
        <p></p>to Amane's chest.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"This way, we'll both be warm."
        <p></p>"…Yes."
        <p></p>"I can also provide my arm as a pillow, as an optional
        <p></p>service."
        <p></p>He offered his arm to her, and with a small smile, Mahiru
        <p></p>hesitantly rested her head on it.
        <p></p>Seeing her face so close, Amane smiled. Then Mahiru's
        <p></p>smile transformed into something a little more impish.
        <p></p>"Now that I've taken you up on the optional service, is
        <p></p>there a cost?"
        <p></p>"A very special price, just for you, Mahiru. You've got to
        <p></p>make omelets for tomorrow's breakfast." 4
        <p></p>"All right, I'm in."
        <p></p>"You're already tucked in, aren't you?"
        <p></p>The two of them laughed together, and Amane wrapped
        <p></p>his other free arm around Mahiru's back and closed his eyes,
        <p></p>embracing her. 10

        <p></p>Chapter 69: What’s Wrong with Liking What You Like? 2
        <p></p>Of all the animals, the one Amane liked best was the cat. 4
        <p></p>He liked most animals, but cats were special.
        <p></p>He had memories of begging his parents to take him to zoos, aquariums,
        <p></p>and even farms when he was a young child, but ultimately, the creatures he
        <p></p>felt the most affection for were the neighborhood cats. He liked them so
        <p></p>much that he had always vaguely thought about getting one as a pet in the
        <p></p>future, when he lived alone. 1
        <p></p>Despite that, as he grew older, he stopped openly saying that he liked
        <p></p>cats.
        <p></p>Around the time he entered middle school, the house cat in his
        <p></p>neighborhood had reached the end of its life span, and he'd stopped seeing
        <p></p>it around. What's more, his classmates had made fun of him for liking cats,
        <p></p>so he had learned to keep it to himself.
        <p></p>And now that Amane was in high school, he lived in an apartment
        <p></p>building and rarely saw stray cats, so he never had the chance to play with
        <p></p>any. Instead, he satisfied himself with watching cat videos online every day.
        <p></p>One of the channels that Amane frequented put out a photo book, and
        <p></p>Amane went out of his way to order one the very day it was released.
        <p></p>Even though he had gone ahead and reserved a copy, the book was
        <p></p>going on sale close to the Christmas shopping season, and Amane was
        <p></p>worried sick that there would be some kind of strange problem at the
        <p></p>bookstore.
        <p></p>He had spent the whole school day restlessly fidgeting, slightly on edge,
        <p></p>and the only thing he had been able to think about was picking up the photo
        <p></p>book on the way home and giving it a good read.
        <p></p>"Welcome home. I'm sure it was chilly outside. Would you like 1
        <p></p>something warm to drink?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had gotten there before him. Amane froze.
        <p></p>Finding Mahiru in his apartment wasn't particularly strange in and of 3
        <p></p>itself.
        <p></p>On top of stopping in at the bookstore, Amane had been tasked with
        <p></p>buying the ingredients for that night's dinner at the supermarket, so he had
        <p></p>gone shopping. It made sense Mahiru got back first, assuming she went
        <p></p>straight home from school.
        <p></p>She came to greet him as if it was the most natural thing in the world, 1
        <p></p>and she blinked several times in surprise when she saw that Amane had
        <p></p>walked in with a pleasant look on his face.
        <p></p>"You've been in a good mood all day."
        <p></p>"Yeah, I guess."
        <p></p>He was much too embarrassed to tell her that he was in high spirits
        <p></p>because he had acquired the coveted cat photo book, so he gave her a
        <p></p>roundabout answer. Of course, that only seemed to make Mahiru even more
        <p></p>interested.
        <p></p>"…Did something happen?"
        <p></p>"Ah, n-no, not really… It's nothing."
        <p></p>"That's not a 'nothing' sort of face, though."
        <p></p>"Really, it's nothing."
        <p></p>Out of embarrassment, he looked away and tried to change the subject.
        <p></p>But apparently, that was even more suspicious, and Mahiru slowly
        <p></p>narrowed her caramel-colored eyes.
        <p></p>They had a general unspoken agreement not to meddle in each other's
        <p></p>private lives, but it would be a different matter if he had done something
        <p></p>inappropriate.
        <p></p>From Mahiru's perspective, it was easy to see that Amane was acting
        <p></p>suspiciously.
        <p></p>She stared at him intently.
        <p></p>His secret was nothing to feel guilty about, but it also wasn't something
        <p></p>he wanted to just come out and talk about, so now he had to worry about
        <p></p>her suspecting him of something more sinister.
        <p></p>His eyes darted around unconsciously, but that only made him seem
        <p></p>even more suspicious. Mahiru's gaze grew extra sharp.
        <p></p>When her eyes fell on the bag from the bookstore, Amane held out the
        <p></p>groceries, doing his best to distract her.
        <p></p>"It's really nothing; please don't worry about it. Would you put the
        <p></p>groceries in the fridge for me? There are frozen things in here."
        <p></p>"I can see that, but something seems off."
        <p></p>"Don't worry about it, please, I'm begging you," Amane said.
        <p></p>As he pushed the supermarket bag into Mahiru's hands, the bag
        <p></p>containing his book slipped off his wrist.
        <p></p>In a slight bit of good fortune, it happened after he had already handed
        <p></p>her the other bag, so no one was hurt, but—the photo book he had been
        <p></p>doing his best to hide fell to the floor with a loud thud.
        <p></p>If there had been a picture of a human on the cover, he might have still
        <p></p>been able to explain it away, but the cover was an extreme close-up shot of
        <p></p>a charming, round-eyed cat. Even as cute cat pictures went, this photo was
        <p></p>really over-the-top.
        <p></p>Silence fell over the room. A wave of despair crashed into Amane.
        <p></p>Mahiru was just as frozen as he was at this sudden development, but she
        <p></p>thawed out first and picked up the fallen photo book.
        <p></p>Amane braced himself for whatever she might say, but Mahiru just
        <p></p>smiled gently at the cute cat on the cover.
        <p></p>"Oh, how adorable!"
        <p></p>Then she lightly brushed the dust off the photo book and handed it to
        <p></p>Amane.
        <p></p>"By any chance, were you late because you went to buy this?"
        <p></p>"…Is that so bad?"
        <p></p>His voice was rather cold, mostly because of the incredible shame.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem put off by his brusque manner of speaking. She
        <p></p>simply wore a calm, pleasant expression.
        <p></p>"No, there's nothing wrong with that. I actually think it's wonderful. But
        <p></p>it was a little suspicious how hard you tried to hide it, even though there's
        <p></p>nothing to feel guilty about."
        <p></p>"I—I thought you would laugh at me."
        <p></p>"I'm upset that you worried I was the kind of person who would mock
        <p></p>someone for things they like. You know I wouldn't do something like that,
        <p></p>right?"
        <p></p>"I—I do, but…there are people who would smirk and tease me for liking
        <p></p>cats so much that I went out of my way to buy a photo book."
        <p></p>"It's not like it's immoral or anything, and it doesn't bother anyone else,
        <p></p>so why shouldn't you be free to like cats or buy photo books if you want?
        <p></p>Most people who scoff at other people's interests can probably find fault
        <p></p>with just about anything."
        <p></p>With these truly openhearted words, Mahiru soothed Amane's lingering
        <p></p>discomfort. For some reason, she looked relieved that there wasn't anything
        <p></p>else in the bag.
        <p></p>"You didn't have to worry about something like that, Amane. You were
        <p></p>being so sneaky, I thought for a moment that you bought something
        <p></p>indecent."
        <p></p>"There's no way!"
        <p></p>It was unavoidable that she would have such suspicions, especially when
        <p></p>a high school boy was obviously trying to hide something, so it was mostly
        <p></p>Amane's fault. He still felt a slight chill run down his spine at being falsely
        <p></p>suspected.
        <p></p>The bookshop wouldn't have sold me that stuff in my school uniform
        <p></p>anyway.
        <p></p>As that strangely logical argument crossed his mind, Mahiru said, "Well,
        <p></p>I did think that it wasn't likely since it's you, Amane."
        <p></p>She seemed to be understanding, so he decided to not share his retort.
        <p></p>"Let me make it clear that I would never buy anything like that… But
        <p></p>out of curiosity, supposing that I had, what then?"
        <p></p>"I would ask you what you were planning to do with stuff you're not
        <p></p>allowed to possess at your age. Not that I don't understand why you'd be
        <p></p>interested, but that's something you shouldn't touch until after you've
        <p></p>graduated high school."
        <p></p>"It's so like you not to say that it's obscene or dirty, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"Well, I might call you a pervert or something."
        <p></p>"I don't have anything like that, so relax already."
        <p></p>"Is that so? Well then, I'm not really sure what we're talking about."
        <p></p>Mahiru cut the conversation off disinterestedly.
        <p></p>Without meaning to, Amane smiled awkwardly. Whether or not he had
        <p></p>anything of the sort in his possession, that had nothing to do with Mahiru.
        <p></p>Neither of them meddled in each other's private life, and as long as they
        <p></p>didn't cause any trouble for the other, they were free to spend their time as
        <p></p>they liked. 2
        <p></p>I shouldn't have been so worried.
        <p></p>If he had acted normally, Mahiru wouldn't have paid any attention
        <p></p>whatsoever to the photo book. Amane had been the cause of his own
        <p></p>destruction.
        <p></p>Even though he still felt like an idiot, after what Mahiru had said, the
        <p></p>clouds hanging over his head cleared up just a little bit. He felt as though a
        <p></p>weight had lifted off his shoulders.
        <p></p>Whether she knew how Amane was feeling or not, Mahiru pointed at the
        <p></p>sink with an easygoing expression.
        <p></p>"Go on, wash your hands and come inside. Even if you want to look at
        <p></p>that photo book right away, first you need to do your coming-home
        <p></p>routine."
        <p></p>"I know, I know."
        <p></p>Amane made it a habit to wash his hands, gargle, and change his clothes
        <p></p>when he got home, and he was still planning on doing all that, so he
        <p></p>wondered why she had made a point of telling him… As he wondered,
        <p></p>Mahiru glanced away somewhat awkwardly.
        <p></p>"—Um…"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"…Could I look at it later?"
        <p></p>She didn't say what she wanted to look at, but he knew perfectly well, so
        <p></p>Amane didn't even try to hide his smile.
        <p></p>"Sure, I don't mind."
        <p></p>"Yay, I thought it was a supercute kitty."
        <p></p>"It sure is."
        <p></p>"Why do you sound so proud…?"
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed a little perplexed, but even so, she didn't make fun of
        <p></p>him. Instead, she smiled at him gently.
        <p></p>Feeling that gentle expression warm his heart, Amane headed to the
        <p></p>sink, somehow in a better mood than he had been in on his way home. 2

        <p></p>Chapter 70: Daily Routine and Meals Worth Remembering
        <p></p>"…What are you writing?"
        <p></p>After dinner, Amane took care of the dishes. When he finished, he saw
        <p></p>that Mahiru was sitting on the sofa jotting down some kind of note.
        <p></p>Initially, he wondered whether it might be a school assignment, but that
        <p></p>didn't seem to be the case. It would have been rude to brazenly read the
        <p></p>contents, so he couldn't get a good look at it.
        <p></p>Glancing at it as he passed behind her, he saw what looked like a list of
        <p></p>dishes, written in neat letters.
        <p></p>Mahiru was used to Amane sitting beside her, and she didn't react to
        <p></p>him taking the adjacent seat. She continued moving her pen in silence.
        <p></p>"It's the menu from last night's dinner. It's helpful later if I make a note
        <p></p>of what I cooked."
        <p></p>Her slightly delayed answer was quite matter-of-fact.
        <p></p>"As the person who does the cooking, I decided I ought to keep track of
        <p></p>these things."
        <p></p>"You're so meticulous."
        <p></p>"I'm just writing down what I made, so it's simple enough. I'm the kind
        <p></p>of person who will pretty much eat the same things all the time, but that's
        <p></p>not so great as far as nutritional balance."
        <p></p>When it came down to it, Amane was also the type who would be
        <p></p>perfectly fine with eating the same thing over and over. But there was
        <p></p>nothing better than getting to eat a variety of dishes.
        <p></p>Since Mahiru had a varied repertoire, she always tried to avoid repeating
        <p></p>the same dishes. At most, she used the previous day's leftovers, such as
        <p></p>curry or meat sauce, to make something new.
        <p></p>Without even having to think back on it, Amane knew that she had been
        <p></p>incorporating a good mix of vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, soy, and dairy into
        <p></p>their meals.
        <p></p>He was grateful when he thought about how much care she put into
        <p></p>these kinds of details, but on the other hand, he also felt bad about it.
        <p></p>"How do I put this? I'm really grateful for everything you do. You have
        <p></p>my respect."
        <p></p>"Stop that. I'm just doing this for my own satisfaction. It's easier to have
        <p></p>a record when I'm trying to manage our nutrition. Plus, if anything ever
        <p></p>happens, I'll be able to check whether there was anything strange in what
        <p></p>we ate."
        <p></p>"I guess that's true, but it's still very thoughtful. Admirable, even."
        <p></p>"I'm not doing it because I want your praise, though. It's convenient to
        <p></p>have later, so I'm making a habit of it. That's all."
        <p></p>"Even so, I think it's impressive."
        <p></p>"…Well, thanks."
        <p></p>He really thought she was amazing. Without exaggeration, she was
        <p></p>terrific and so sincere.
        <p></p>"As someone who basically specializes in eating and can barely recall
        <p></p>the names of dishes, I find it incredible that you came up with an idea like
        <p></p>this."
        <p></p>"…Now that you mention it, for someone who specializes in eating, you
        <p></p>do know a fair number of dishes once they're laid out on a table. And you
        <p></p>have a good sense of taste, especially considering that before I started
        <p></p>cooking for you, all you seemed to eat was instant ramen and ready-made
        <p></p>food."
        <p></p>"At home, my parents…well, if I had to say, I guess it was my dad—my
        <p></p>dad made me try all sorts of things, so I got to eat lots of good stuff."
        <p></p>Amane knew that his palate wasn't necessarily dull just because he
        <p></p>didn't cook.
        <p></p>Just like how food critics aren't always expert cooks, it was possible to
        <p></p>hone his sense of taste, even though he couldn't prepare the dishes he was
        <p></p>tasting.
        <p></p>Amane's parents were good cooks, especially his father, and they were
        <p></p>the type of people who had regularly taken him to various restaurants. This
        <p></p>gave him plenty of opportunities to taste and compare a wide variety of
        <p></p>foods. 1
        <p></p>Thanks to their efforts, Amane had been raised with a fairly discerning
        <p></p>palate, which wasn't always a good thing.
        <p></p>"…I see. That makes sense. I had a similar experience."
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to understand without feeling any particular discomfort
        <p></p>about it, but her expression didn't brighten.
        <p></p>He was just guessing, but Amane figured that could be attributed to her
        <p></p>home environment.
        <p></p>He didn't know all the details about Mahiru's situation, and he couldn't
        <p></p>thoughtlessly butt in as an outsider, so he refrained from mentioning it any
        <p></p>further and instead turned his gaze back to the paper that her pen had been
        <p></p>running across until just a moment earlier.
        <p></p>"Can I take a look?"
        <p></p>"At this? I don't mind, but it's not particularly organized."
        <p></p>"I doubt that's true, but even if it isn't, I'd like to see it, if that's all
        <p></p>right."
        <p></p>Without hesitation, Mahiru granted Amane's request and handed him the
        <p></p>notebook.
        <p></p>After thanking her, he turned to the first page and saw detailed menus
        <p></p>inside, going back about three months and ordered by date. Everything was
        <p></p>written in Mahiru's tidy handwriting.
        <p></p>Her notes started on the day they had first eaten a meal together.
        <p></p>A nostalgic menu of miso soup, fish simmered in soy sauce, stewed
        <p></p>greens, and rolled omelets was listed there, and he let a smile slip out at the
        <p></p>vivid memory of it.
        <p></p>Amane flipped through the pages, musing that Mahiru's attitude toward
        <p></p>him had softened quite a bit since that first meal and reminiscing as he
        <p></p>revisited menu after menu.
        <p></p>Mahiru certainly incorporated all types of cooking, but looking at the
        <p></p>menus collected like this, he noticed there was a lot of Japanese food.
        <p></p>It was common knowledge that Amane loved eggs, so dishes that
        <p></p>incorporated them frequently showed up at their dinner table. He was
        <p></p>keenly aware that Mahiru had been paying close attention to his preferences 1
        <p></p>in more ways than one.
        <p></p>"Ah, these were sooo good."
        <p></p>As he was reading, Amane came across an entry for pouch eggs,
        <p></p>probably his second favorite egg dish of Mahiru's, after her rolled omelets.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed faintly pleased that he was excited but not at all
        <p></p>surprised.
        <p></p>This dish was made by closing up eggs in fried tofu skins and simmering
        <p></p>them in a sweet and salty broth, something that was not very difficult for
        <p></p>Mahiru to do.
        <p></p>"They don't take too much work to make. They are tasty, though, huh?"
        <p></p>she said softly.
        <p></p>Of course, Amane knew that anyone would probably be happy to hear
        <p></p>that something they had made was delicious, but all the food Mahiru made
        <p></p>was delicious, so it all came down to preference.
        <p></p>"…You really do love eggs, don't you?"
        <p></p>"The egg is magnificent. It's delicious whether you simmer it, bake it,
        <p></p>boil it, fry it, steam it, or smoke it, and it's chock-full of protein. I'd eat
        <p></p>eggs every day if I could."
        <p></p>"Sure, they've got good nutritional value, and I like to eat at least one a
        <p></p>day, but I find it hard to appreciate them quite as much as you do, Amane."
        <p></p>"Really? I just like them so much."
        <p></p>"…Do you want to eat some pouch eggs?"
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>Amane stiffened at the sudden proposal, but Mahiru retained her usual
        <p></p>calm expression. He hadn't meant to make a request, but apparently, his
        <p></p>impassioned declaration of love for eggs had given her ideas.
        <p></p>"I feel kinda bad."
        <p></p>"Don't. We're about to run out of eggs anyway, so I was just thinking
        <p></p>we should buy a new carton. Let's see… Tomorrow's menu is already set,
        <p></p>but I can change what I was planning for the day after. Nutrition won't be
        <p></p>an issue if I make a few extra side dishes, so it's an easy request to
        <p></p>fulfill…"
        <p></p>"Really?"
        <p></p>Without meaning to, he stared at Mahiru in joy.
        <p></p>For some reason, Mahiru cleared her throat after she noticed him staring.
        <p></p>Then she quietly answered, "…I don't mind."
        <p></p>Though it was low, Amane caught every word and let out a little "Yay!"
        <p></p>Then his cheeks naturally softened into a smile. "All right! I'm looking
        <p></p>forward to the day after tomorrow, then."
        <p></p>He was always excited for Mahiru's cooking, but hearing that she was
        <p></p>going to make one of his favorites only heightened his anticipation.
        <p></p>They had a hellish marathon scheduled in gym class that day, for reasons
