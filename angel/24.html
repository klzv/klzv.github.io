        displeased. She had seemed to be in a good mood earlier, but that had evidently been<p></p>
        part of the act, for now shades of ill humor were flashing across her eyes.<p></p>
        "You really saved me back there," Amane said.<p></p>
        "I take my eyes off you for one second… Really, I was only gone for a short while.<p></p>
        Unbelievable. I wouldn't have left you alone if I knew this would happen…" Mahiru was<p></p>
        muttering to herself.<p></p>
        With a sudden rush of guilt, Amane noticed his gaze had drifted lower and lower over<p></p>
        Mahiru's body. He seemed to be the only one who was agitated by the close contact—<p></p>
        Mahiru didn't seem to be paying it any mind.<p></p>
        "You really don't know how to tell a stranger off, do you, Amane?" Mahiru didn't show<p></p>
        any sign of being aware of Amane's internal turmoil. She just looked exasperated.<p></p>
        "Maybe I can't turn them down, or maybe I just don't know how to handle that type of<p></p>
        stranger. They were girls, so I didn't want to act rough or use strong language. I<p></p>
        wouldn't know what to do if I made them cry or something."<p></p>
        "Honestly, I don't know whether you're gentlemanly or a total loser."<p></p>
        "Hey, shut up, that was the first time something like that has ever happened to me, so<p></p>
        I couldn't help it. I never would've imagined in a million years that girls would come<p></p>
        over and talk to me."<p></p>
        Amane never would have thought, with so many people hanging around, that someone<p></p>
        would talk to him of all people.<p></p>
        "Assertive girls are incredible, huh? They even approach antisocial guys like me."<p></p>
        "…The way you look now isn't really antisocial… If anything, you look more like a fresh,<p></p>
        friendly young man."<p></p>
        "Those are very nice words that don't describe me at all."<p></p>
        "Well, a makeover can only go so far…"<p></p>
        "How nice of you to say."<p></p>
        Mahiru was right—even if he looked a little nicer on the outside, there could be no<p></p>
        mistake that inside he was as gloomy as ever. Amane laughed despite himself.<p></p>
        This straightforward way of speaking was also one of the things he appreciated about<p></p>
        Mahiru. He found it very endearing. It was far preferable to being lied to.<p></p>
        He knew she definitely was not intending to disparage him, so he accepted her words<p></p>
        with a gentle understanding.<p></p>
        But Mahiru sighed for some reason. "Okay, I suppose I have to just tell you outright.<p></p>
        You're definitely not bright or cheerful, but I wouldn't say you're gloomy, either. To me,<p></p>
        you seem calm and composed, and when I'm with you, I feel calm, too. Like I can relax.<p></p>
        Even if we're not talking, I feel comfortable when I'm by your side, and I think that's<p></p>
        wonderful."<p></p>
        "…Oh, you do?"<p></p>
        Her compliments were embarrassing, and Amane could only manage a short reply.<p></p>
        Mahiru didn't seem satisfied, though. She pressed against his arm again, seemingly<p></p>
        unaware of how weak it made him.<p></p>
        "And how do you feel when you're with me?"<p></p>
        "…At home, I feel calm."<p></p>
        "And now?"<p></p>
        "…Now I can't relax at all. Because someone keeps pressing her chest up against me." 1<p></p>
        That must have been completely unexpected, and she must have been completely<p></p>
        unaware of what she was doing, because Mahiru froze stiff and looked down at her<p></p>
        own chest.<p></p>
        And then her face turned red with such force she looked like a boiling kettle.<p></p>
        "I thought you were doing it on purpose."<p></p>
        When he joked that she had been causing him terrible distress, to the point it bordered<p></p>
        on harassment, she glared up at him with slightly teary eyes. It didn't have the slightest<p></p>
        impact, probably because he knew she was doing it to hide her embarrassment.<p></p>
        "Wha—? Y-you dummy, I would never!"<p></p>
        "I know that. I was joking, sorry."<p></p>
        He knew that if he teased her too much she would start sulking, so he apologized<p></p>
        quickly to defuse the bomb. Mahiru's raging emotions now extinguished, she grumbled<p></p>
        only a small complaint. But she didn't really have anything more to say and instead<p></p>
        settled on punching him once in the side to vent her anger.<p></p>
        Smiling at her obvious frustration, Amane took hold of her hand again to make sure<p></p>
        there was some space between them.<p></p>
        "Don't cling to me so closely."<p></p>
        "…Can we still hold hands?"<p></p>
        "I'll lose you if we don't."<p></p>
        If they let go of each other and got lost in the Golden Week crowds, it would defeat the<p></p>
        purpose of going out together in the first place.<p></p>
        "…What would you do if you lost me?"<p></p>
        "I would use my phone to contact you and pick a place to meet up, like normal."<p></p>
        "How pragmatic."<p></p>
        "Guess so. Well, I'll try not to let you go."<p></p>
        If he let her slip from his grasp and made her wander around by herself, Mahiru was<p></p>
        far more likely to get hit on, so he didn't intend to let her look like she was alone.<p></p>
        Mahiru had specifically requested this outing and probably wanted to enjoy a pleasant<p></p>
        day rather than being hounded by people she had no interest in. Besides, even though<p></p>
        Amane knew Mahiru was often approached by other guys, he didn't have to like it.<p></p>
        At Amane's words, Mahiru stared deeply into his eyes, then lowered her gaze to their<p></p>
        joined hands. And then her lips curved softly into a smile, and in a voice as gentle as a<p></p>
        blooming flower, she said, "…Yes. Please don't let me go." 1<p></p>
        She whispered quietly and entwined her fingers with his. Trying not to let her sense<p></p>
        his sudden panic, Amane responded in kind.<p></p>
        "…So this is a game center…"<p></p>
        After they finished at the clothing stores and variety shops and had made a few<p></p>
        purchases, Amane led Mahiru to his favorite arcade.<p></p>
        Coming here had been her idea. They had put this place last on their list of destinations;<p></p>
        so even if they won prizes at the crane games, they wouldn't have to carry them around<p></p>
        everywhere. After this, they were going straight home, so they had plenty of time.<p></p>
        Finishing the day here had undoubtedly been the right call.<p></p>
        Apparently, Mahiru had never come here with Chitose, either, and she looked adorable,<p></p>
        marveling at everything around her.<p></p>
        "There really are all sorts of games here, huh?"<p></p>
        "Sure are. Not just crane games but arcade games and physical games, too. This game<p></p>
        center has a ton of different types."<p></p>
        "I can see that. And it's super loud."<p></p>
        "Ah, most places like this are."<p></p>
        Mahiru was frowning a little, reminding Amane that the cacophony typical of game<p></p>
        centers could be grating to the ears for someone not accustomed to it. He was used to<p></p>
        this ambience, so he was fine.<p></p>
        The section with slots and arcade games was even louder, so he weaved his way<p></p>
        around those areas as he walked through the game center with Mahiru following<p></p>
        behind him.<p></p>
        "So what'll you play?"<p></p>
        "I want to try a crane game. I want to try winning a stuffed animal."<p></p>
        Her sights seemed to be set on the crane games. She looked around that section of the<p></p>
        game center, alternately squeezing and releasing his hand in her excitement.<p></p>
        It was Golden Week, so the game center had gotten a lot of new prizes and had stocked<p></p>
        plenty of cute stuffed animals that were more family-oriented, so there were plenty<p></p>
        that Mahiru would probably like.<p></p>
        "…Amane, I want to get that one."<p></p>
        "Hmm, which one?"<p></p>
        "That one. That cat… Don't you think it looks like Silky?"<p></p>
        The toy Mahiru was pointing at was a cat with white fur that turned dark brown<p></p>
        around its face. With its blue eyes, it did indeed resemble Silky, the cat who had first<p></p>
        greeted Mahiru at the cat cafe , and she seemed enamored by it.<p></p>
        "It really does look like her. You want it?"<p></p>
        "I do. Can I try?"<p></p>
        "Sure. I think the machines here are easy to win, but if you can't get it, I'll get it for<p></p>
        you."<p></p>
        "I'll try my best so you don't have to."<p></p>
        Eager to take on this new challenge, Mahiru squared off against the crane game, while<p></p>
        Amane hung back and watched. If Amane was to take a turn, he could easily secure the<p></p>
        prize, but Mahiru wanted to win this one, and it was best to let her tackle the challenge<p></p>
        alone.<p></p>
        She inserted a coin and timidly pressed the first button to move the crane arm to the<p></p>
        side for just a moment, then checked its position. Typical of the prudent Mahiru, she<p></p>
        seemed to be confirming how far it would move with one press of the button.<p></p>
        But with this type of crane game, once you let go of the button, it shifted into verticalmovement mode.<p></p>
        "Wait, huh? It won't move."<p></p>
        "Sorry, I forgot to tell you. Once you let go of the button, it shifts to vertical movement,<p></p>
        so you've only got the one chance."<p></p>
        "Ah, so now…"<p></p>
        "No matter what you do, it won't reach the stuffed animals."<p></p>
        The toys were placed in the middle of a wide open space, but the arm had only barely<p></p>
        moved away from the drop chute, and all that was left to set was vertical movement.<p></p>
        No matter how Mahiru struggled, she wouldn't be able to touch the prizes.<p></p>
        This game center also had the type of crane games that were timed and used a lever<p></p>
        that could move in all directions, but this particular machine was the button type, so<p></p>
        there was unfortunately no going back. This happened to a lot of people when they<p></p>
        were first playing crane games, so there was really no getting around it.<p></p>
        "Well, that hundred yen is gone, but you still have the vertical movement, so you can<p></p>
        use this as a chance to get a feel for the speed the arm moves and the lag after you<p></p>
        release the button. Then you can use that information on your next try."<p></p>
        "Hmm… I'll do that. It's my fault for being careless," she said, then moved the arm with<p></p>
        intense concentration, paying careful attention to the speed.<p></p>
        Amane felt like he hadn't given her enough warning on her first attempt, so he quietly<p></p>
        inserted another coin, which made Mahiru look at him with dissatisfaction. Amane<p></p>
        said "It's fine" and patted her on the back for encouragement. Reluctantly, she returned<p></p>
        to her game.<p></p>
        She must have more or less figured out the speed at which the arm moved, because on<p></p>
        her next attempt, she was able to line it up laterally with the position of the stuffed<p></p>
        animals.<p></p>
        It was somewhat off-center, but she still had a chance to reach her target along the<p></p>
        vertical axis. Even if she didn't grab right in the center of the toys, considering the<p></p>
        arm's center of gravity and the force of its grip, plus the timing of when it released, she<p></p>
        could still get something.<p></p>
        Mahiru was a total beginner, but Amane was impressed with how skillfully she was<p></p>
        already playing. She carefully moved the arm along the vertical axis until it was more<p></p>
        or less above the stuffed animals, then tried to pick up the stuffed cat.<p></p>
        Her aim was good, but the toy was slightly oblong, so when the arm squeezed, the<p></p>
        center of gravity shifted immediately, and the cat fell.<p></p>
        "Hmm."<p></p>
        "Almost. Instead of trying to pick up the actual toy, it'll be easier if you move it with<p></p>
        one side of the crane arm and take advantage of its center of gravity to make it roll<p></p>
        over."<p></p>
        Luckily, the partition around the drop chute wasn't very tall, so if she could roll the cat,<p></p>
        it should fall down.<p></p>
        Mahiru blinked intently, then obediently carried out the movements as she had been<p></p>
        told.<p></p>
        One thing he appreciated about Mahiru was her ability to take advice without getting<p></p>
        angry or stubborn.<p></p>
        She made another attempt for the cat, taking into account the position of the arm and<p></p>
        the stuffed animal's center of gravity.<p></p>
        "So I'll do this here… and move the head…"<p></p>
        Mahiru's serious expression was reflected in the game cabinet's glass. Amane laughed<p></p>
        quietly so she wouldn't hear him.<p></p>
        After inserting several more coins and trying for a while, Mahiru finally moved the toy<p></p>
        into the prize chute with the crane arm.<p></p>
        She let out a quiet gasp as the stuffed cat fell with a plunk against the flap covering the<p></p>
        end of the prize chute.<p></p>
        After a moment of silence, Mahiru looked up at Amane, slightly stunned.<p></p>
        "…It fell."<p></p>
        "Yeah, good work… Look, it's proof of your victory."<p></p>
        Amane retrieved the stuffed animal she had fought so hard for and held it out to<p></p>
        Mahiru. The reality that she had finally won the prize seemed to be sinking in. Right<p></p>
        before his eyes, an expression of delight transformed her beautiful features.<p></p>
        "I—I got it. I got it, Amane!"<p></p>
        "You sure did. You did great for your first time."<p></p>
        He patted her head for a job well done, and she squinted in embarrassment and tightly<p></p>
        embraced her prize, the stuffed cat that closely resembled Silky.<p></p>
        She seemed especially happy that she had won the toy by herself and smiled in<p></p>
        satisfaction as she rubbed her cheek against the stuffed animal.<p></p>
        Amane was feeling a bit jealous of the stuffed cat as she squeezed it tightly with a<p></p>
        cherubic smile. He was having a hard time keeping his emotions in check as he watched<p></p>
        her celebrate.<p></p>
        Mahiru embraced the stuffed animal with an expression of incredible delight, but then<p></p>
        suddenly she looked in Amane's direction and timidly held the toy out to him.<p></p>
        "…Um, will you… accept this?"<p></p>
        "Huh, me?"<p></p>
        "Well, you've given me so many, and you seemed to really like Silky, so…"<p></p>
        Amane liked cats, and that cat in particular had been cute in the way she resembled<p></p>
        Mahiru. But he couldn't come out and say that, so he just scratched his cheek and<p></p>
        nodded.<p></p>
        "…Or you're a guy, so you don't need stuffed animals; is that it…?"<p></p>
        "No, that's not why. I was just wondering if it's really all right for me to take it, since<p></p>
        you worked so hard to win it."<p></p>
        "I was trying to win it for you. I mean, I don't want to sound pushy, umm… But you said<p></p>
        it looked like Silky, so I thought maybe you liked it, so… If you don't want it, I'll decorate<p></p>
        my apartment with it, but…" She looked up at him uneasily, shoulders drooping a little<p></p>
        as if disheartened. There was no way he could turn it down now.<p></p>
        "All right, I'll take it and keep it in my room. Though I, uh… I won't put it by my pillow<p></p>
        like you did with yours."<p></p>
        "I—I wish you'd forget about that…"<p></p>
        "I'll treasure the cat."<p></p>
        Amane politely accepted the stuffed animal from Mahiru, grabbed a carrying bag for<p></p>
        prizes from the dispenser nearby, and placed the cat inside.<p></p>
        Mahiru watched him with a happy smile, and Amane was just about to extend his hand<p></p>
        to her again, when—<p></p>
        "Huh? Shiina?"<p></p>
        A voice called out to her from somewhere nearby, and Amane froze.<p></p>
        Mahiru stiffened, too, and they both turned awkwardly to face the direction the voice<p></p>
        had come from. Standing there was a young man whose handsome face was both<p></p>
        innocent and dignified… Yuuta Kadowaki.<p></p>
        "Kadowaki?"<p></p>
        At the sight of Yuuta, Mahiru immediately put on her angelic smiling face that she<p></p>
        displayed at school. But it seemed a little stiffer than usual, probably because she was<p></p>
        still struggling to regain her composure.<p></p>
        It was Golden Week, so they were well aware there was a good possibility of running<p></p>
        into their classmates, but they had never expected to meet someone they had recently<p></p>
        started hanging out with.<p></p>
        "It's surprising to see you in a game center… Uh, did I interrupt something, perhaps?"<p></p>
        Yuuta noticed Amane and looked worried. He didn't seem to have recognized yet that<p></p>
        it was Amane, but as soon as Amane spoke, he was sure to be found out. On the other<p></p>
        hand, Yuuta's attention was focused on Mahiru, so there was a chance that Amane<p></p>
        could escape notice.<p></p>
        "No, not at all…," Mahiru said.<p></p>
        "This is the first I've heard about you having a boyfriend, you know."<p></p>
        "He's not my boyfriend; we don't have that kind of relationship."<p></p>
        Amane felt a twinge of heartache at Mahiru's flat denial, but it was true that they 1<p></p>
        weren't dating, so he really didn't have any right to complain. It would have been<p></p>
        stranger if she'd said otherwise.<p></p>
        "W-well, to all appearances… Hmm?"<p></p>
        Yuuta, obviously bewildered by Mahiru's stubborn demeanor, was about to question<p></p>
        her again, when he suddenly focused his attention on Amane.<p></p>
        Their eyes met, and Amane's cheek twitched.<p></p>
        Yuuta stared hard, as if puzzling over what he saw. This was an extremely bad situation<p></p>
        for Amane.<p></p>
        "…Fujimiya?"<p></p>
        Just as Amane expected, Yuuta recognized him.<p></p>
        They hadn't been hanging out for that long yet, but even so, it was clear that Yuuta was<p></p>
        perceptive. No matter how differently Amane dressed or styled his hair, he couldn't<p></p>
        deceive his new friend.<p></p>
        Amane had hoped that maybe Yuuta wouldn't look at a stranger so closely, and he did<p></p>
        look pretty different today, but Yuuta didn't miss the connection.<p></p>
        "Huh, Fujimiya… It's you, right? I can tell now that I see you up close… Could it be, you<p></p>
        two knew each other long ago and met again at school?"<p></p>
        "No, well…"<p></p>
        Yuuta seemed to take it as confirmation when he saw Mahiru hesitating to answer. He<p></p>
        looked back and forth between Mahiru and Amane, appearing downright astonished.<p></p>
        Before he'd started hanging out with Yuuta, Amane might have denied everything, but<p></p>
        now that wasn't even remotely possible. He sighed heavily and pressed on his forehead,<p></p>
        then looked up at Yuuta, who was wearing an inquisitive expression.<p></p>
        "…I'm impressed that you recognized me."<p></p>
        "I knew it! Well, somehow I just knew it was you, Fujimiya."<p></p>
        "Is it that easy to tell?"<p></p>
        "Nah, I don't think anyone in our class would figure you out that quickly. You don't<p></p>
        make that sort of face very often."<p></p>
        Amane wasn't sure what "that sort of face" meant, but for the time being, Yuuta didn't<p></p>
        seem to have made the connection between Amane and the "mystery man" Mahiru<p></p>
        had been spotted with, so he was relieved.<p></p>
        "Anyway, it's really something else to run into the both of you, together like this."<p></p>
        "…There's no point in hiding it, so I'll just tell you. It's like you said, we have indeed<p></p>
        known each other since before we started second year. I'll even admit to being good<p></p>
        friends. But we really don't have the kind of relationship that you're imagining,<p></p>
        Kadowaki."<p></p>
        "…Oh really?"<p></p>
        "Really."<p></p>
        Mahiru had not hesitated to deny that there was something going on, so even though<p></p>
        it made him sad to say it, Amane was also clear in his denial. It would cause trouble<p></p>
        for Mahiru if the misunderstanding went any further or became more complicated.<p></p>
        The one who found them just happened to be Yuuta, so he wasn't all that worried, but<p></p>
        there would be trouble if others became suspicious—and their secret got out. He<p></p>
        absolutely had to forbid Yuuta to speak of it.<p></p>
        Amane adopted a firm stance, and Mahiru grasped his sleeve and looked up at him.<p></p>
        She seemed to have something to say but didn't make any move to open her mouth, so<p></p>
        for the time being, he didn't press her.<p></p>
        Yuuta watched Amane's and Mahiru's behavior, and whether he understood or didn't,<p></p>
        he shrugged slightly.<p></p>
        "Hmm… Well, that's all fine and good. I have to say, it's just like Itsuki said."<p></p>
        "What did he say?"<p></p>
        Amane's eyes narrowed involuntarily when he thought about Itsuki having some slip<p></p>
        of the tongue.<p></p>
        "Nothing you need to worry about." Yuuta laughed. "But he said you look cool when<p></p>
        you get dressed up properly. I was just thinking you do look really sharp."<p></p>
        "That sounds sarcastic coming from you, Kadowaki."<p></p>
        Amane could do nothing but smile bitterly at the compliment from the top heartthrob<p></p>
        in their year, maybe in the whole school.<p></p>
        Yuuta was the type of guy who didn't have to try to be attractive. Guys like Amane, who<p></p>
        had to spend time getting dressed up just to look decent, were always destined to be<p></p>
        jealous of guys like him. Amane didn't go so far as to begrudge the other boy his good<p></p>
        looks, but he did on occasion imagine having a more lustrous life if he'd only had the<p></p>
        good fortune to be born like that.<p></p>
        "I wasn't trying to be sarcastic. Just saying, you should style yourself like this all the<p></p>
        time."<p></p>
        "No way; it would be a pain to set my hair every morning. And it would stand out if I<p></p>
        suddenly showed up at school looking like this."<p></p>
        "Well, that is true, but… Shiina, you must have known that Fujimiya could look like<p></p>
        this?"<p></p>
        "That's, well… Yes."<p></p>
        Mahiru nodded uncomfortably as Yuuta turned to study her.<p></p>
        It wasn't a look of scrutiny or distrust. More like he was searching for clues.<p></p>
        "Mm-hmm, I think I understand."<p></p>
        "Understand what?"<p></p>
        "That you also don't want to cause Shiina any trouble."<p></p>
        Mahiru looked startled by his words. Yuuta laughed quietly and said, "You're easier to<p></p>
        read that I expected, Shiina."<p></p>
        He gave a thin smile. It looked somewhat warm, yet lonely in a way—and perhaps even<p></p>
        tinged with a bit of jealousy.<p></p>
        "Um, Kadowaki?" Mahiru asked hesitantly.<p></p>
        "Hmm?"<p></p>
        "Well… I'd like to ask you not to say anything about this to other people. About us being<p></p>
        f-friends, and… everything." Mahiru would be troubled if he said anything, so she also<p></p>
        asked for his silence.<p></p>
        Yuuta nodded readily. "Ah, you don't have to worry about that. I think I understand<p></p>
        why you want to keep this hidden, and I appreciate how you feel. Besides, I've found<p></p>
        that once rumors about you are spread around, you don't much enjoy spreading them<p></p>
        yourself."<p></p>
        Amane had never been so grateful that Yuuta was such a person of character. Also, he<p></p>
        imagined that their situation was probably something Yuuta could deeply relate to. He<p></p>
        was extremely popular with the girls at school, and so he often had to deal with<p></p>
        jealousy from members of his own sex, and on the flip side, if he ever made friends<p></p>
        with a member of the opposite sex, that girl would be in danger. He had told Amane as<p></p>
        much, so he was probably speaking from experience.<p></p>
        Even if they didn't have a romantic relationship, if it became known that a plain guy<p></p>
        like Amane had become friends with the graceful angel Mahiru, who turned away<p></p>
        every suitor, there was bound to be trouble.<p></p>
        Amane was very grateful that Yuuta apparently understood that and would keep his<p></p>
        peace.<p></p>
        "Thanks, Kadowaki."<p></p>
        "Yeah, well, I think it's the normal thing to do. And besides, I wouldn't want to do<p></p>
        anything to jeopardize our relationship, Fujimiya. Not after I finally managed to make<p></p>
        a friend."<p></p>
        Yuuta flashed one of his bright smiles at them, and looking at him, Amane keenly<p></p>
        understood why this boy was so popular. Even speaking as another boy, Amane thought<p></p>
        that Yuuta was a friendly, earnest guy, so he could understand how the girls might find<p></p>
        him utterly charming. It wasn't just because he was handsome; he was also a good<p></p>
        person. The other guys in their class didn't stand a chance.<p></p>
        "Oh, that's right. Fujimiya?"<p></p>
        "Hmm?"<p></p>
        "I'll see you the day after tomorrow."<p></p>
        That day, which Yuuta casually mentioned in a slightly coy tone, was the day when<p></p>
        Amane, Itsuki, and Yuuta had planned to go to karaoke together. In other words, Yuuta<p></p>
        was telling him he would be asking for more details about this situation then.<p></p>
        When their eyes met, Yuuta was wearing a playful smile, underpinned by his peculiar<p></p>
        brand of confidence.<p></p>
        "Got it," Amane answered, though he really felt like running away.<p></p>
        Mahiru watched Amane and Yuuta with a hint of jealousy.<p></p>
        "Sorry about that."<p></p>
        They had separated from Kadowaki and were on their way home, and on the walk to<p></p>
        the apartments from the nearest train station, Amane apologized to Mahiru in a quiet<p></p>
        voice.<p></p>
        Mahiru, who was quite satisfied that she had won some other small toys at the game<p></p>
        center, blinked her caramel-coloured eyes in surprise at this sudden apology.<p></p>
        "What are you apologizing for, all of a sudden?"<p></p>
        "Well… for getting found out by Kadowaki."<p></p>
        "Surely that was an accident. Besides, I think everything turned out all right. He<p></p>
        seemed to be rather understanding…"<p></p>
        Now that she said that, he knew it was true, but even so, he was annoyed that someone<p></p>
        suspected that they were dating.<p></p>
        Fortunately, Yuuta had not hung around long, probably because he could tell how<p></p>
        uncomfortable Amane was in that situation. Still, it had tugged at Amane's heart to<p></p>
        hear Mahiru deny everything so definitively.<p></p>
        "Besides, it's not like we weren't aware that something like this could happen when<p></p>
        we decided to go out," Mahiru continued. "Considering the possibilities, I think we're<p></p>
        lucky it was Kadowaki who saw us."<p></p>
        "You're right. For better or worse, Kadowaki knows, but at least he's being cool about<p></p>
        it. He really is a stand-up guy."<p></p>
        It's a good thing he's the one we ran into.<p></p>
        Amane had resigned himself to being cross-examined later, but when he considered<p></p>
        that he would no longer have to feel guilty about continuing to conceal things from<p></p>
        Yuuta at school, it was actually probably a good thing that they were discovered.<p></p>
        Amane had a feeling that Yuuta had also discerned how he felt about Mahiru, but as<p></p>
        long as he didn't tell Mahiru herself, there would be no problem on that front.<p></p>
        He would probably get teased a little bit at karaoke, but Yuuta and Itsuki both had<p></p>
        some discretion in that area, so he shouldn't get it too bad.<p></p>
        "…Amane, you have quite a high opinion of Kadowaki, don't you?"<p></p>
        "Hmm? Uh, I guess so. We've had more and more chances to talk, and I've come to<p></p>
        realize he's popular because he's a really good guy. He's really attractive inside and<p></p>
        out."<p></p>
        "And you trust him, don't you?"<p></p>
        "Trust him…? Well… Yeah, I think he's a stand-up guy."<p></p>
        Amane already knew he could be pretty picky about the people he hung out with. If he<p></p>
        didn't like someone's personality, he would naturally keep them at arm's length. But<p></p>
        Amane's gut told him that Yuuta was a good guy, and that was exactly why he wasn't<p></p>
        too panicked at being found out.<p></p>
        "All right, well, they do say birds of a feather flock together," Mahiru mused.<p></p>
        "I don't know if I belong to that flock…"<p></p>
        "You're putting yourself down again, Amane. Kadowaki decided to be friends with you<p></p>
        because he liked your personality, right? Isn't that the same thing you thought about<p></p>
        him? And Kadowaki, who you think is trustworthy, recognizes something good in you,<p></p>
        so you ought to have more confidence."<p></p>
        Mahiru gently poked his cheek with the tip of her finger, and Amane smiled softly at<p></p>
        her.<p></p>
        Of course he couldn't grant her wish, but as someone who always thought the worst<p></p>
        of himself, he was grateful for her reassurance.<p></p>
        Amane chuckled quietly at Mahiru's sudden lecture on self-confidence, but he also felt<p></p>
        very grateful toward her.<p></p>
        "You're always saying nice things about me, huh, Mahiru?"<p></p>
        "Well, I'm only telling the truth. It's not good for you to always be so hard on yourself."<p></p>
        "It's a habit."<p></p>
        "Well, why did you develop that bad habit? It's a real pain, you know." Mahiru grumbled<p></p>
        in open frustration.<p></p>
        He wasn't sure how to answer the question. Though he knew perfectly well the reason<p></p>
        why.<p></p>
        The simple answer was that he was afraid of failure.<p></p>
        Humans are quick learners. That goes for things both good and bad. Amane didn't<p></p>
        want to fail, and he didn't want to get his hopes up, only for others to turn on him. So<p></p>
        in order to protect himself from disappointment, he kept his expectations low.<p></p>
        But he didn't know how he should tell Mahiru that. And honestly, he didn't particularly<p></p>
        want to have to explain it.<p></p>
        Mahiru stared at him with clear eyes, like she could read his mind. Then just as he<p></p>
        started feeling uncomfortable, she looked away, leaned toward him, and pressed<p></p>
        herself against his upper arm again.<p></p>
        "If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to, but please just remember that I accept<p></p>
        you, okay? It's not good to be so hard on yourself."<p></p>
        "…Sure."<p></p>
        "If I need to, I'm going to praise you until you beg me to stop."<p></p>
        "Whoa, scary. You say it like that, but I really do want you to stop. I can't take it<p></p>
        anymore."<p></p>
        "Well then, you need to have more self-confidence."<p></p>
        Mahiru smiled faintly and squeezed his hand. Feeling heat gradually surging up<p></p>
        through his chest but not wanting to destroy this pleasant moment, Amane didn't let<p></p>
        go. He just replied with a quiet "Thanks" and kept walking down the road home.<p></p>
        He didn't want to let go of her hand, but he knew that they would have to let go once<p></p>
        they reached home, so he deliberately walked a little slowly, and Mahiru matched his<p></p>
        pace without saying another word.<p></p>
        Chapter 36: An Interrogation<p></p>
        "Now then, I would like to ask you a bit about what happened the day before<p></p>
        yesterday."<p></p>
        It was two days after Amane's outing with Mahiru. The day he had plans to go sing<p></p>
        karaoke with Itsuki and Yuuta.<p></p>
        As soon as they had assembled and entered their reserved room, Yuuta immediately<p></p>
        turned to him with a smile.<p></p>
        Amane had prepared himself for an interrogation, but even so, he felt really awkward<p></p>
        being asked about this again.<p></p>
        Itsuki seemed to have heard about the incident from Yuuta and was wearing an<p></p>
        expression that said Uh-oh, you got caught! He wasn't even trying to hide his<p></p>
        amusement.<p></p>
        After bringing the cup of melon soda he had gotten from the self-service drink bar to<p></p>
        his lips and wetting his throat, Amane reluctantly began to explain.<p></p>
        "…It's nothing that serious. Itsuki and Chitose knew about it already. Mahiru and I live<p></p>
        next door to each other. That was honestly a total coincidence. And well, a bunch of<p></p>
        things happened, and we got closer, I guess."<p></p>
        Thanks to Chitose, there was no use in trying to conceal the fact that they were already<p></p>
        on a first-name basis, so as he explained the situation, he used Mahiru's name like he<p></p>
        always did at home.<p></p>
        "You got to know each other, and then you went out together?"<p></p>
        "Yeah."<p></p>
        They were obviously more than simple acquaintances. In the best-case scenario, they<p></p>
        looked like friends, in the worst, lovers. But as far as Amane was concerned, for the<p></p>
        sake of Mahiru's honor, he had to flatly deny everything.<p></p>
        "It's definitely not the kind of relationship you're imagining, Kadowaki," he reasserted.<p></p>
        "And I have a feeling it's not quite what you're describing, Fujimiya."<p></p>
        "Come on—"<p></p>
        "Their situation goes way beyond friends, I'd say," Itsuki interjected. "Considering<p></p>
        Shiina comes over to make dinner for him every day."<p></p>
        Amane's cheek twitched as he glared at his friend. "Itsuki!"<p></p>
        "The truth was gonna come out sooner or later, so it's better to just hurry up and spill<p></p>
        it all now."<p></p>
        When he put it that way, Itsuki was probably right, but by suddenly providing the<p></p>
        detail that Amane was eating Mahiru's home cooking every day, he all but guaranteed<p></p>
        a misunderstanding.<p></p>
        "…So she's like your girlfriend?"<p></p>
        "Not even a little," Amane insisted. "We both live alone, so it's more convenient to split<p></p>
        the food costs and make enough for two; that's all."<p></p>
        "Yeah, that's definitely all it is…," Itsuki said without a trace of sincerity.<p></p>
        Yuuta looked unimpressed. "That's not very convincing, Fujimiya…"<p></p>
        "Not you too, Kadowaki…"<p></p>
        He and Mahiru definitely were not in love with each other, but he was having a hard<p></p>
        time explaining that, and the way Yuuta was staring at him was making him nervous.<p></p>
        Not that he'd been all that composed to begin with.<p></p>
        "Normally, a girl won't hang around a guy she doesn't approve of, and she definitely 1<p></p>
        wouldn't follow him into his apartment. Unless she's the one chasing after him<p></p>
        anyway."<p></p>
        Yuuta's addendum at the end sounded like it came from a place of experience, which<p></p>
        reminded Amane how wary Yuuta was of girls and their intentions. But he was right,<p></p>
        more or less, Amane realized.<p></p>
        Girls, and Mahiru in particular, were usually very careful and typically didn't approach<p></p>
        guys without reason. Amane recognized that the fact that Mahiru associated with him<p></p>
        at all was close to miraculous. But he knew this was a special case.<p></p>
        Amane just couldn't imagine she would ever like him as a guy, or anything like that.<p></p>
        Sometimes he even thought that the reason Mahiru was so comfortable around him<p></p>
        was because she didn't even consider him a man.<p></p>
        "…Fujimiya, you're so hard on yourself," Yuuta said. "And you can be really stubborn."<p></p>
        "What he said," Itsuki agreed.<p></p>
        Itsuki and Yuuta were both looking at Amane with exasperated looks, so it was really<p></p>
        uncomfortable.<p></p>
        "So when it comes down to it, do you like Shiina?"<p></p>
        Yuuta chose to thrust this outrageous question at him at the exact moment Amane<p></p>
        took a drink of his melon soda to mask his discomfort, and he very nearly spit it back<p></p>
        out. "…Why would you ask that, all of sudden?" he sputtered.<p></p>
        "Well, you're being pretty cagey, but I saw how you acted when you were out with<p></p>
        Mahiru, so I'm sure you must care about her, even if only a little. Plus, I could tell by<p></p>
        the way you looked at her—and by your whole demeanor, really—that you like her."<p></p>
        Amane nodded meekly. "…Is there something wrong with that?"<p></p>
        Man, Yuuta sure as hell pays close attention…<p></p>
        For some reason, Yuuta smiled wryly at him. "No, it's not bad or anything, but… mmm,<p></p>
        it probably won't be easy, I'd imagine."<p></p>
        "I have no delusions about dating Mahiru."<p></p>
        "Yes, yes, I can see there are still some things you don't understand. Itsuki's here to<p></p>
        give you some encouragement, too."<p></p>
        "You could say that," Itsuki muttered. "What I really want is to give him a strong kick<p></p>
        in the ass."<p></p>
        Yuuta nodded. "I know just how you feel."<p></p>
        "Don't tell me that's where you two agree…," Amane groaned.<p></p>
        So now Yuuta's ready to kick me in the butt, too?<p></p>
        "Look, man, the thing is: It's really frustrating to watch," Itsuki said. "We want you to<p></p>
        push the issue a little."<p></p>
        "Give it a rest already!"<p></p>
        "Hold on; just listen for a sec, all right?" Itsuki continued. "Shiina lets her guard down<p></p>
        around you. If you put a little pressure on, she'll give in for sure."<p></p>
        "Okay, listen, I admit, Mahiru probably likes me, but… she doesn't like me that way;<p></p>
        you know what I mean?"<p></p>
        Itsuki made it all sound so easy, but Amane knew better.<p></p>
        To begin with, he was incredibly self-conscious about the very fact of his deep affection<p></p>
        for Mahiru. He did have to admit that she seemed to care about him more than any<p></p>
        other guy, but he didn't think her feelings were romantic. Instead, he figured it was<p></p>
        something akin to the way you might feel about a close and trusted confidant.<p></p>
        "How can you say that, when you've seen the way she looks at you?"<p></p>
        "What would she find attractive about me?"<p></p>
        When Amane offered that rebuttal, Itsuki smacked him on the back as hard as he<p></p>
        could.<p></p>
        "…Oww!"<p></p>
        "I feel bad for hitting you, but come on, are you kidding me? You seriously have way<p></p>
        too little confidence! You lose your nerve or run away at the most crucial moment."<p></p>
        "…Yeah well, so what? That's just how I am. I can't help it."<p></p>
        "We've got to break the habit, then. You're way too down on yourself."<p></p>
        "Mahiru tells me that a lot."<p></p>
        "…So it's bothering Shiina as well?" Yuuta asked.<p></p>
        "It's bothering all of us who have to watch him!" Itsuki clamored. "This guy is so<p></p>
        stubborn about things like that."<p></p>
        "Shut up, will you!"<p></p>
        Amane really hated it when people ganged up on him.<p></p>
        This was just the way he was, and even if he did try to change, it certainly wouldn't be<p></p>
        that easy. Traumatic memories didn't just go away because he wanted them to. Not<p></p>
        enough time had passed yet for him to try to forget and move on.<p></p>
        Amane was well aware of how pathetic and worthless he was, but there was nothing<p></p>
        he could do.<p></p>
        "I mean, I can't force your hand if you tell me you've had enough," Itsuki said. "But if<p></p>
        you like Shiina, and you want to go out with her, you need to try harder."<p></p>
        "…And you think I can do that?"<p></p>
        "If you weren't such a wuss…"<p></p>
        "Oh, shut up."<p></p>
        "Come on, that's enough," Yuuta chided. "But I do have to say I agree with Itsuki. You<p></p>
        should have a little more faith in yourself, Fujimiya. Really, you'd get a lot of attention<p></p>
        at school if you dressed up like you did the other day. Maybe you should give it some<p></p>
        practice."<p></p>
        "Practice?"<p></p>
        "Well, you didn't have any trouble getting dressed up for Shiina, and you didn't freak<p></p>
        out when I saw you like that, either. So maybe practice your new look on people you<p></p>
        know, so you can get used to it. A good way to enjoy this precious break, don't you<p></p>
        think?"<p></p>
        "…Meaning what?"<p></p>
        "Let's see; I've got some hair wax in here somewhere…"<p></p>
        Swiftly, Yuuta pulled some men's grooming wax out of his bag. When their eyes met,<p></p>
        Yuuta was grinning boldly. Typical of the class prince, it was a lovely smile, but it sent<p></p>
        a chill down Amane's spine. "So how about it?" he asked.<p></p>
        "…I'll pass."<p></p>
        "Come on now, don't be shy."<p></p>
        "Hey, uh, aren't we at a karaoke parlor? Shouldn't we be doing karaoke or something?"<p></p>
        "Oh, you're right!" Yuuta replied. "Okay, I'm gonna sing, so I'll entrust Amane to your<p></p>
        capable care, Itsuki my friend."<p></p>
        "Just leave it to me."<p></p>
        "You've gotta be joking…," Amane muttered. All he got in return was an enthusiastic<p></p>
        grin.<p></p>
        "I mean, usually this isn't the kind of thing I'd do by force, but… in your case, Amane,<p></p>
        it's time you got used to being the center of a little bit of attention, so I've got to take<p></p>
        drastic measures!"<p></p>
        "Hey, you can't… Waah!"<p></p>
        Itsuki grinned and brandished the comb and hair wax, and though Amane tried to back<p></p>
        away, there wasn't enough space for a proper retreat in the small karaoke room.<p></p>
        Amane was forced to endure Yuuta's joyful singing while Itsuki meddled with his hair.<p></p>
        "…Welcome ho… me…?"<p></p>
        When Amane made it back to his apartment, Mahiru came out to greet him with a<p></p>
        question in her voice.<p></p>
        She was making stewed hamburger steaks for dinner and had let herself into Amane's<p></p>
        apartment early to make the sauce.<p></p>
        She had sent him a message saying that dinner was nearly done, so he knew that she<p></p>
        would be at his place, but when he saw Mahiru's face again, he felt a rush of relief.<p></p>
        "I'm back…"<p></p>
        "Why do you look so worn out…?"<p></p>
        "…Itsuki had his way with me."<p></p>
        Itsuki had never seen Amane's "mystery man" look, so he had styled Amane's hair in<p></p>
        a way he thought looked cool, which of course didn't really fit what Amane was used<p></p>
        to.<p></p>
        To make matters worse, after they were done with karaoke, the other boys had dragged<p></p>
        him to a store that carried the type of clothes that Amane wasn't likely to have and<p></p>
        then embarked on a hunt for something that would suit him.<p></p>
        He hadn't particularly hated the experience or anything, but he was completely<p></p>
        exhausted, having been treated like a dress-up doll by his two friends.<p></p>
        "Uh-huh, you had a tough time, didn't you?"<p></p>
        "…They played with me like a toy…"<p></p>
        "You must be tired."<p></p>
        Maybe because she could tell he wasn't actually upset, Mahiru let a quiet chuckle slip<p></p>
        out as she commended him for his patience.<p></p>
        Feeling slightly embarrassed at being so transparent, Amane tossed the bag containing<p></p>
        the new clothes he had purchased into his room and went to the sink to wash his<p></p>
        hands.<p></p>
        Mahiru returned to the kitchen to serve dinner, so when Amane entered the living<p></p>
        room after properly washing his hands and rinsing his mouth, she had already set the<p></p>
        dishes of stewed hamburger steaks down on the dining table.<p></p>
        Amane felt bad for not helping, so as he always did, he headed for the kitchen to dish<p></p>
        up the cooked rice.<p></p>
        Amane had always thought rice paired nicely with hamburger steak, and the<p></p>
        indescribable sweet aroma of freshly cooked rice made him smile.<p></p>
        "Man, I'm really tired… But actually, it made me appreciate Itsuki and Yuuta again.<p></p>
        They're amazing."<p></p>
        "What do you mean?"<p></p>
        Once they had set out the salad and potage soup and taken their seats across the table,<p></p>
        Mahiru tilted her head at Amane's curious grumblings.<p></p>
        "Well, we got hassled constantly while we were walking around. It made me realize<p></p>
        that guys who have always been popular are a different breed of human. They're used<p></p>
        to that treatment, and the way they go through life is just different."<p></p>
        When the boys had gone on their shopping tour after karaoke, for some reason, various<p></p>
        girls who seemed to be about college age had come up to talk to them several times.<p></p>
        Well, Itsuki and Yuuta were both handsome guys, although in different ways, so it<p></p>
        seemed only natural for them to catch girls' eyes. They had experienced the so-called<p></p>
        reverse pickup.<p></p>
        They had declined every proposal, though. Itsuki had his true love, Chitose, and the<p></p>
        class prince apparently hated pushy girls. He wore a sweet smile but was always on<p></p>
        guard, and before long, their would-be dates got the message that he was turning them<p></p>
        down. Even when he was rejecting them, Yuuta was affable and considerate, so he<p></p>
        wouldn't hurt their feelings. And it seemed to work well for him. Amane had struggled<p></p>
        to deal with a similar situation earlier, and he was impressed by his friend's wellpracticed tact.<p></p>
        "…Did the girls talk to you, too, Amane?"<p></p>
        "They did, but only because I happened to be with the guys."<p></p>
        If he had to guess, the girls were really only interested in his two friends and saw<p></p>
        Amane merely as a nice bonus. After all, as he well knew, he was very bad at talking to<p></p>
        strangers. Once in a while, somebody would talk to him when he went out somewhere,<p></p>
        but this time there had been two exceptionally handsome guys next to him, so no one<p></p>
        was going to give him a second look.<p></p>
        Amane shrugged and grinned wryly, but for some reason, Mahiru was sticking her lip<p></p>
        out in a little pout.<p></p>
        "What is it?" he asked. "You want to tell me I'm being too hard on myself?"<p></p>
        "Well, there's also that… But that's not it."<p></p>
        "What is it, then?"<p></p>
        "…If you don't know, then don't worry about it," Mahiru said unhelpfully, before<p></p>
        pressing her hands together in thanks. "Let's eat."<p></p>
        Amane was perplexed, but he mimicked her and pressed his hands together, giving<p></p>
        thanks for the food and for Mahiru.<p></p>
        It was the day after the three boys had gone to karaoke.<p></p>
        As usual, Mahiru had come over to Amane's apartment.<p></p>
        Recently, she had been spending a lot of time there when she wasn't at school. In fact,<p></p>
        since the start of Golden Week, she had been at his place almost every day. Even if she<p></p>
        wasn't there during the day, she would always come over to make dinner in the<p></p>
        evening. Amane was of course quite happy to have the object of his affections close by,<p></p>
        so he let Mahiru do whatever she liked.<p></p>
        Today, she was next to him playing on her phone. Fiddling with her phone was a<p></p>
        completely normal thing to do, of course, but she was staring at the screen with a bit<p></p>
        more enthusiasm than usual.<p></p>
        And while it would have been an invasion of her privacy to peek at the screen, and<p></p>
        Amane had no intention of doing so, he couldn't help but say something, since it was<p></p>
        so unusual for Mahiru to be absorbed in her phone like that, when she usually only<p></p>
        used it to contact someone or look something up.<p></p>
        "What have you been looking at all this time?" Amane ventured, figuring that just<p></p>
        asking wouldn't be rude.<p></p>
        For some reason, Mahiru jumped at his question. Then she turned to look in Amane's<p></p>
        direction with a nervous frown. Amane was puzzled. He wasn't sure what might make<p></p>
        her act that way.<p></p>
        Then Mahiru turned away from him. She only did that when she was feeling guilty<p></p>
        about something.<p></p>
        "…You're hiding something," Amane insisted.<p></p>
        "H-hiding…? Well, promise you won't get mad?"<p></p>
        "Are you doing something that would make me mad?"<p></p>
        Amane had been told that his resting facial expression looked a bit sullen, but he very<p></p>
        rarely got angry, and he had never before gotten truly upset with Mahiru. He didn't<p></p>
        think she'd give him a reason to lose his temper—at worst, he could imagine getting a<p></p>
        little annoyed.<p></p>
        "…Depending on how you're feeling, you might get upset."<p></p>
        "Hmm. Well, why don't you tell me, and we'll see?"<p></p>
        "…Well, your mother has been… sending me old photos of you."<p></p>
        "Oh, I'm sure she had plenty to share…"<p></p>
        He had a lot of questions for his mother about why she thought it was okay to send<p></p>
        Mahiru photos of him out of the blue like that.<p></p>
        "W-well, there's a reason, you see. Your mother and I were talking, and we just<p></p>
        happened to get on the subject of Children's Day, and… and I said 'I bet Amane was<p></p>
        really cute when he was little… ' So you see…"<p></p>
        "Wait, let me take a look at them. She didn't send you anything really outrageous,<p></p>
        right?"<p></p>
        When it came to old photos, there were sure to be some Amane had forgotten about.<p></p>
        But he could definitely remember a few that captured embarrassing moments he<p></p>
        would rather nobody see. His mother really ought to have let him inspect the pictures<p></p>
        before sending any to Mahiru.<p></p>
        Mahiru refused to answer his question. She wouldn't even look him in the eye. From<p></p>
        her reaction, Amane could guess that the photos were something he wouldn't like. He<p></p>
        glowered at her but wasn't about to try to rip the smartphone out of her hands, so he<p></p>
        decided to press her until she capitulated and confessed.<p></p>
        "Mahiru… would you rather cooperate and show me the photos, or am I gonna have<p></p>
        to bug you till you do?"<p></p>
        With a serious look on his face, Amane sat up on one knee and put a hand on the back<p></p>
        of the sofa behind Mahiru's head. He leaned in close to her, leaving her with little room<p></p>
        to escape.<p></p>
        Mahiru's face would go pale when she saw he had cornered her… or so he thought, but<p></p>
        instead she flushed red and squeezed her favorite cushion to her chest. She looked<p></p>
        even more nervous than before but still wasn't talking.<p></p>
        Is it that bad…?<p></p>
        Amane had a sinking feeling. He continued staring intently into Mahiru's eyes, but he<p></p>
        didn't get the reaction he was hoping for. Far from it, she tried to push the cushion into<p></p>
        his face.<p></p>
        Amane grabbed the cushion and tossed it aside. He didn't understand why she was<p></p>
        making such a big fuss. Mahiru must not have been holding the cushion too tightly,<p></p>
        because he was easily able to pull it out of her hand and send it rolling across the floor.<p></p>
        Mahiru still hadn't budged from her spot on the sofa.<p></p>
        "Come on; it's time to fess up," Amane whispered as he closed in to pinch her cheek.<p></p>
        Without warning, Mahiru flopped down on the sofa. It happened so quickly that<p></p>
        Amane couldn't react, and on her way down, Mahiru collided with the arm he'd been<p></p>
        using to support himself, so he also lost his balance and tumbled down onto the sofa.<p></p>
        Fortunately, he managed to catch himself before he crushed Mahiru, but he ended up<p></p>
        much closer to her than he expected.<p></p>
        Both of them froze at this sudden proximity. 3<p></p>
        Their bodies weren't too close, but their faces were so close that their breath<p></p>
        intertwined, and if he leaned in just a little, their noses would bump. Amane was close<p></p>
        enough to see that the long eyelashes that rimmed Mahiru's wide, caramel-coloured<p></p>
        eyes were quivering slightly. At this distance, Mahiru's characteristic sweet scent filled<p></p>
        his nostrils, and he didn't know what he should do.<p></p>
        Both of them were frozen stiff, but Mahiru was the first to move.<p></p>
        Her light-pink lips trembled, and she squeezed her eyes shut tightly. Her face was<p></p>
        flushed, and she was taking shallow, timid breaths. She appeared nervous, as if she<p></p>
        was preparing for some kind of impact, but her lips looked soft and sweet. She seemed<p></p>
        simultaneously innocent and alluring. Mahiru practically embodied such contradictions.<p></p>
        Amane couldn't look away.<p></p>
        The sight of her aroused both his desire to protect her and the urge to make her his,<p></p>
        and in spite of his better judgment, Amane reached out his hand—<p></p>
        —and pinched Mahiru on the cheek. 2<p></p>
        "Wha—?"<p></p>
        "…That's a funny face," he muttered with a wry chuckle.<p></p>
        Mahiru's eyes flew open, and her expression changed in an instant. Instead of the<p></p>
        bashfulness from before, now it was more like equal parts shame and anger. She glared<p></p>
        at him through tear-filled eyes. "Is that what you're going to say after pinning a girl<p></p>
        down and touching her face?"<p></p>
        Amane smiled again. "Okay, okay, that was my bad. I wasn't expecting a struggle."<p></p>
        "Oh, well excuse me for putting up a fight!" she replied. "It only happened because you<p></p>
        pushed me down!"<p></p>
        "That was because you were hiding the photos my mom sent you behind my back."<p></p>
        "Ack!… Ughhh."<p></p>
        When it became clear that Mahiru wasn't going to say anything else, Amane moved off<p></p>
        of her, still smiling. He slipped a hand between the sofa and Mahiru's back and helped<p></p>
        her sit up. Mahiru moved her lips like she was mumbling something to herself and<p></p>
        made an odd expression.<p></p>
        "So…," Amane said. "Are you going to let me examine my own photographs?"<p></p>
        "…Knock yourself out," she said with resignation. She still sounded annoyed, and her 1<p></p>
        face was as red as ever, but she showed Amane the image list from the chat between<p></p>
        his mother and her.<p></p>
        If he was to point out how badly she was blushing, she would probably rush right out<p></p>
        of his apartment, so Amane resisted the urge to say anything else as he looked away<p></p>
        so Mahiru couldn't see his face.<p></p>
        …That was a surprise.<p></p>
        Amane was trying to stay calm, but even now his heart was pounding out a rhythm<p></p>
        with explosive force.<p></p>
        He wasn't sure what he might have done to Mahiru if he hadn't stopped himself and<p></p>
        pinched her instead. She had certainly shown no signs of stopping him.<p></p>
        Man, I was almost a real jerk just then…<p></p>
        Shame weighed heavy in his gut. Yes, it had been an accident, and maybe they were<p></p>
        both at least a little bit to blame. But that certainly didn't make it okay to touch Mahiru<p></p>
        so intimately, in a manner usually reserved for lovers. That would not have been<p></p>
        acceptable.<p></p>
        If he had gone ahead and kissed her, he was sure Mahiru would have burst into tears<p></p>
        or something along those lines. It wouldn't have been right to do something like that.<p></p>
        He wasn't her boyfriend or anything. And if he had done it anyway, she would have<p></p>
        definitely cut him out of her life for good.<p></p>
        Amane didn't want to be the kind of selfish person who only thought about what he<p></p>
        wanted.<p></p>
        "…Amane, you said you wanted to check the photos, but are you even going to look at<p></p>
        them?" Mahiru asked. She sounded even more sullen than before, and when Amane<p></p>
        looked in her direction, he saw that the redness in her face had finally started to abate<p></p>
        somewhat, and she had her cheeks puffed out a bit.<p></p>
        "Sorry, I was busy thinking."<p></p>
        "Dummy."<p></p>
        Mahiru didn't often insult him, and she had used a word that was kind of cute, but<p></p>
        Amane could tell from her tone that she was running out of patience, so he quickly<p></p>
        looked down at the smartphone.<p></p>
        In the photo roll were pictures of Amane from preschool and elementary school. At a<p></p>
        glance, he didn't see anything especially painful, so that was a relief, but there were<p></p>
        images of him beaming with an innocent smile he couldn't even imagine emulating<p></p>
        now, so he still felt awfully embarrassed.<p></p>
        Amane's face was turning red for a different reason at this moment, and to distract<p></p>
        himself from the shame welling up inside, he glanced over at Mahiru. She was no<p></p>
        longer wearing a sullen expression—instead, she was staring dreamily out into space<p></p>
        with her hand over her mouth, looking dazed. 3<p></p>
        Sensing that he wasn't supposed to see her like that, Amane quickly lowered his eyes<p></p>
        back to the phone.<p></p>
        His heart was pounding again, and he tried to focus his eyes and his mind on anything<p></p>
        else.<p></p>
        Chapter 37: None but You<p></p>
        …Come to think of it, Amane, are you doing anything for Mother's Day?" Mahiru asked<p></p>
        quietly, as if she had just remembered the holiday. They were watching television<p></p>
        together, and she'd noticed a listing for a program labeled as a Mother's Day special.<p></p>
        Amane had tried to casually change the channel, figuring that Mahiru wouldn't like<p></p>
        being reminded of her parents, but she didn't seem particularly bothered.<p></p>
        He nodded, feeling a little relieved that she wasn't upset. "Well, I guess I'll send a small<p></p>
        present and a bouquet to the house."<p></p>
        It was a little bit of a hassle, but she was his one and only mother, after all, and he<p></p>
        figured as her son he ought to show his appreciation for everything she did for him.<p></p>
        But since he was out of the house now, it wasn't like he could go say it in person.<p></p>
        "Well, since I'm far away, that's about all I can do. If we still lived together or close by,<p></p>
        I would try to do a little more, but…"<p></p>
        "Like help with the housework?"<p></p>
        "Honestly, if I try to help, I just end up making more work for her."<p></p>
        Thanks to Mahiru, Amane had learned how to do basic housework, or at least enough<p></p>
        to get along okay on his own. But he didn't think he would be able to do everything to<p></p>
        his parents' standards, so they would just end up redoing everything in the end.<p></p>
        "I guess you would."<p></p>
        "I don't know how I feel about you agreeing with that…"<p></p>
        "…But you have learned enough to keep up with the everyday chores. I mean, it's far<p></p>
        from perfect, but you can get by now."<p></p>
        "That's a harsh appraisal. That said, you're not wrong."<p></p>
        "Heh-heh. You've still got a ways to go, Amane."<p></p>
        "Yes, yes, I'm no match for the marvelous Miss Mahiru."<p></p>
        "I'll say."<p></p>
        Amane had a feeling that even if he spent his whole life working on it, he would never<p></p>
        get as good at housework as Mahiru was now.<p></p>
        Mahiru laughed, a little surprised by Amane's words, and slapped his upper arm, but<p></p>
        there wasn't any malice behind it, so he didn't complain.<p></p>
        "I don't know how your parents could make you live alone when you couldn't even<p></p>
        take care of yourself, Amane."<p></p>
        She probably hadn't meant to say that out loud—but she'd obviously been thinking it.<p></p>
        When they'd first met, Amane had been such a mess that even Itsuki had been worried<p></p>
        about him. So it was no surprise Mahiru would doubt him now. She knew exactly how<p></p>
        bad it could get.<p></p>
        Amane pretended not to notice the shock of pain that went through his chest and<p></p>
        shrugged. "Actually, I don't think they ever wanted to let me out of their sight? a<p></p>
        I was real loser with absolutely no life skills, after all."<p></p>
        "So it was your decision to move out on your own?"<p></p>
        "Yeah. Some stuff happened, and I didn't want to stay in my hometown anymore."<p></p>
        If he made it sound too serious, Mahiru was likely to worry, so he tried to,<p></p>
        gloss over it, attempting to keep his cool while he did.<p></p>
        Mahiru froze. Immediately, shades of remorse began flickering through
        <p></p>
        her caramel-coloured eyes.
        <p></p>
        Amane hadn't meant to upset her, but Mahiru, who was particularly<p></p>
        sensitive to other people's pain, had gotten a glimpse of the baggage he was carrying.<p></p>
        Sometimes her insight could be troubling.<p></p>
        Amane regretting mentioning it in the first place. He reached out and patted Mahiru<p></p>
        on the head as she grimaced at him.<p></p>
        "Ah, you really don't have to worry about it," he said. "Actually, it puts me in a tough<p></p>
        spot if you're too worried about me. Really, it's not that big of a deal. There were just<p></p>
        some guys in my hometown who I would rather not see again, so I left."<p></p>
        In reality, it hadn't been that serious. Just that something he had earnestly believed in<p></p>
        had crumbled from its very foundation; that's all. He hadn't been physically injured or<p></p>
        anything like that, and now that he had cut off all contact with those guys, he was living<p></p>
        a normal life, and the dull ache of old wounds had faded into the background.<p></p>
        Despite what he said, Mahiru's melancholy expression didn't go away. Amane was<p></p>
        stumped. "I'm really fine, you know?" he insisted. "If it was still painful, I wouldn't be<p></p>
        talking about going home to visit. As far as I'm concerned, it's in the past."<p></p>
        "…Liar."<p></p>
        "Liar? Listen here—"<p></p>
        "If you really were over it, you wouldn't be making that face."<p></p>
        Mahiru trembled slightly as she extended a hand toward Amane's cheek. Her eyes<p></p>
        were downcast, so he couldn't even see a reflection of his expression, but going off<p></p>
        what she said, it probably wasn't anything good.<p></p>
        "…If you don't want to say, that's fine. But it's painful for me to see you looking so hurt."<p></p>
        "Don't say that. It's not that big of a deal; it's not even an interesting story, okay?"<p></p>
        Amane insisted. "Are you still worried about it, even so?" he asked quietly, and Mahiru<p></p>
        nodded slightly.<p></p>
        Amane scratched his cheek and wondered what to do. He let out a soft sigh.<p></p>
        "Hmm… I wonder where I should begin. Well, I guess it makes sense to start with why<p></p>
        I wanted to leave my hometown, huh?"<p></p>
        "…Yes."<p></p>
        "It's because I wanted to get some distance from my friends… or I guess I should say<p></p>
        from the people who I thought were my friends."<p></p>
        It didn't sound like a very good reason for moving. Anyone else would probably think<p></p>
        he was worrying too much over something small.<p></p>
        And yet that time of his life was etched indelibly into Amane's memory.<p></p>
        "How should I put this…?" he began. "Well, I was blessed with a good home environment."<p></p>
        Mahiru looked a bit curious about this abrupt change in topic, but she must have<p></p>
        understood that this was necessary to understand the full story because she listened<p></p>
        quietly.<p></p>
        "I had relatives—my parents and grandparents—who loved me, and we were well-off.<p></p>
        Financially, I mean. They let me study and do whatever I wanted. I was very lucky, and<p></p>
        I know that."<p></p>
        His parents had been especially doting on him, since he was their only son, and they<p></p>
        had raised him in a way that respected Amane's individuality.<p></p>
        "But at that time, I wasn't really aware of how incredibly blessed I was, and I had never<p></p>
        learned to be suspicious of people. I was surrounded by good people and was raised<p></p>
        with love, so to be honest, I was a really naive child."<p></p>
        Now Amane was sulky, but before the incident took place, he had been so honest and<p></p>
        cheerful it was impossible to imagine, looking at him now. He had been a really<p></p>
        childish child.<p></p>
        "…I think that my naï vete made me especially easy to deceive and to use."<p></p>
        And so there had been many openings to take advantage of him.<p></p>
        "The new friends I made in the first half of middle school… I don't actually know if I<p></p>
        can honestly call them friends, but the guys who I started hanging out with… Well, to<p></p>
        tell the truth, they saw me as an easy mark, as a good source of money. When you come<p></p>
        from a well-off family, it's only human for people to want to get something out of you."<p></p>
        It sounded pathetic to say it, but back then, Amane had been honest to a fault and<p></p>
        incredibly gullible. In other words, he was easy to fool. He'd grown up believing in the<p></p>
        innate goodness of others, and nothing had ever challenged that redundant naï vete .<p></p>
        Nobody he knew would have ever tried to take advantage of him.<p></p>
        Mahiru's expression had grown stiff, so in order to try to relax her, Amane smiled and<p></p>
        said, "Of course, I wasn't a total fool, so I never directly gave them any money or<p></p>
        anything." But Mahiru's expression only got even more severe.<p></p>
        "And then, well, I discovered that they were saying all sorts of things behind my back.<p></p>
        They trashed my appearance. I heard them say I was gross and that they hated me and<p></p>
        had only ever intended to take me for all I was worth from the very beginning. I was<p></p>
        shocked and pretty depressed for a while."<p></p>
        People all have different preferences when it comes to who they get along with, and<p></p>
        Amane wouldn't have minded if they'd just said they didn't like him. But since they<p></p>
        thought they could get something out of him, they had all smiled to his face and abused<p></p>
        him in private, and that was something he couldn't bear.<p></p>
        He had told Mahiru the mild version of the story, but there had also been insults that<p></p>
        would be difficult to repeat, so he had really endured a lot. Now he would be able to<p></p>
        shrug off abuse like that, but at the time, he had been an earnest and sensitive boy, and<p></p>
        it had just been too much for him to bear.<p></p>
        "Of course, I knew that not everybody in the world was like those guys. I had a few<p></p>
        friends that I believe really liked me. Even so, once I started doubting people, fear took<p></p>
        over. I couldn't trust anyone."<p></p>
        He had shut himself up in his room for a while and cried.<p></p>
        He had eventually recovered, thanks to his parents' support, but as one might expect,<p></p>
        he was afraid to come into contact with those boys again, so he did every last possible<p></p>
        thing to avoid them for as long as he could—<p></p>
        "…And so I left my hometown. I left to get a fresh start in a place where no one knew<p></p>
        me. I left so I wouldn't be bothered by those guys anymore."<p></p>
        He hadn't known whether he could make it on his own, but he'd decided that his peace<p></p>
        of mind was worth the risk.<p></p>
        Thanks to everything that had happened, he could no longer easily trust people like<p></p>
        he once had and had grown into an introverted and skeptical young man who had just<p></p>
        finally managed to make two friends after taking ages to warm up to them. Amane had<p></p>
        to laugh at himself. For better or worse, he had become quite conservative, but at this<p></p>
        point, that attitude was deeply ingrained, and there was no changing it now.<p></p>
        Amane had finished talking, and Mahiru was trembling. Her hands were balled into<p></p>
        fists, and the emotion flickering in her eyes was unmistakably anger. Amane was<p></p>
        surprised to see the mild-mannered Mahiru get so enraged, and then he was even<p></p>
        more baffled when he realized that she was angry on his behalf, and that brought him 1<p></p>
        a little joy.<p></p>
        "…If I had been there, I would have punched those awful guys right in the face."<p></p>
        "Please, no; you would just hurt your own hand… And you don't have to get your hands<p></p>
        dirty for my sake, even in your imagination."<p></p>
        Those jerks weren't worth Mahiru getting her hands dirty—not even close. And<p></p>
        anyway, Amane had already cut them out of his life. It would be nothing but a waste<p></p>
        for Mahiru to even bother with them.<p></p>
        Mahiru relaxed a bit. She'd been squeezing her hands so hard they had started turning<p></p>
        white. Some of the anger faded from her face, replaced by an even deeper look of<p></p>
        sorrow.<p></p>
        When it came to Amane, Mahiru could be so compassionate it almost hurt. But this<p></p>
        incident was in the past, and Amane was embarrassed to have upset her over it.<p></p>
        "Really, it wasn't as agonizing as your situation, so you don't have to be so sad."<p></p>
        "Amane, it's not something that can be compared. I don't even want to try."<p></p>
        She cut him off flatly, and Amane frowned when he realized that had been rude, but<p></p>
        she looked at him and put on a calm expression.<p></p>
        "Let me say this—it's not that there's no value in sharing our experiences, but your<p></p>
        grief is your own, and it's something that only you can carry, and it can't be compared<p></p>
        to my grief. Nothing is better or worse. In the truest sense, I can't understand your<p></p>
        pain, Amane, nor can you understand mine."<p></p>
        "…Ah."<p></p>
        "What I can do is accept your sadness and support you… just like you've done for me.<p></p>
        I want to be there for you, and I want you to rely on me." Mahiru whispered this as she<p></p>
        placed the palms of her hands against both of Amane's cheeks.<p></p>
        He gradually felt a heat rising from the depths of his chest and behind his eyes. "…But<p></p>
        I already rely on you all the time," he said.<p></p>
        "Emotionally, I mean."<p></p>
        "I always rely on you."<p></p>
        "…Well, do it more."<p></p>
        "Don't spoil me, please."<p></p>
        "I'm going to. So, so much."<p></p>
        "I'm really not worth it." 1<p></p>
        "Why are you worried about that now? I've always known you were a hopeless case,<p></p>
        Amane."<p></p>
        He felt himself grimace when she casually delivered this harsh and yet undeniable<p></p>
        truth. But even though she sounded exasperated, Mahiru looked at him with gentle,<p></p>
        loving eyes that communicated the opposite.<p></p>
        "…But I also know you're a very good person, and you can endure a lot. Too much,<p></p>
        even," she continued. "You can at least let me spoil you a little."<p></p>
        Her sweet whispering voice, genuine and kind, threatened to obliterate what little<p></p>
        resistance Amane had left. He could imagine himself letting her spoil him forever, and<p></p>
        the thought struck a deep chord of fear within him, because he knew that if he let<p></p>
        himself grow too dependent on the girl he deeply loved, nothing would ever seem as<p></p>
        sweet.<p></p>
        For the sake of preserving what little dignity he had left, Amane slowly shook his head.<p></p>
        "Really, I'm fine," he insisted.<p></p>
        Mahiru batted her eyes and sighed dramatically. "…You're trying to act cool again," she<p></p>
        said wearily. "You big dummy."<p></p>
        Mahiru mocked him sweetly, then slipped her hands from Amane's cheeks around to<p></p>
        the back of his head. And then she pulled him toward her with all her strength.<p></p>
        Before he could react, Amane's face was pressed up against Mahiru's chest. He froze.<p></p>
        He could feel the softness of her skin and hear the beating of her heart, and when he<p></p>
        inhaled, his lungs were filled with her sweet scent—a mix of milk and some kind of<p></p>
        flower, with a little note of something bright, like green apple—and his mind was utter<p></p>
        chaos.<p></p>
        "Please, just let me spoil you," she said.<p></p>
        "…You're really forward" was the best answer his addled brain could muster.<p></p>
        But Mahiru's shoulders trembled with laughter. "Did you just realize that? Sometimes<p></p>
        girls can be very pushy, you know," she whispered impishly.<p></p>
        Fully aware of Amane's bewilderment, Mahiru gently wrapped her arms around his<p></p>
        back so he couldn't get away. Of course, she was still a slim young woman, so if Amane<p></p>
        wanted to shake free, he probably could have. However, the sweet scent and Mahiru's<p></p>
        warmth, plus her pleasant softness and the calming rhythm of her heartbeat, sapped<p></p>
        all of Amane's willpower to defy her.<p></p>
        "…Besides, I'm the type of person who always repays a debt," she whispered. Amane<p></p>
        had to fight to keep from losing himself in her warmth. "I relied on you before, Amane.<p></p>
        You spoiled me, too, remember? And now it's my turn, all right? Let me spoil you back.<p></p>
        It's the least I can do."<p></p>
