        <p></p>feelings, so there's no opening for someone to take
        <p></p>advantage of."
        <p></p>"Just don't get carried away… I don't want to let other
        <p></p>people see too many of your cute faces."
        <p></p>"…You're so quick to say things like that!" 2
        <p></p>Flustered by Mahiru's sudden burst of inexplicable anger,
        <p></p>Amane tried to soothe her by stroking her hair, but she beat
        <p></p>playfully at his chest.
        <p></p>"When you say things like that so casually, I just can't take
        <p></p>it," she exclaimed.
        <p></p>"What does that mean?" "It's bad for my heart." 1
        <p></p>"Hey, that's my line… And anyway, you're one to talk.
        <p></p>Sometimes I feel like I might die, because you fawn all over
        <p></p>me so naturally."
        <p></p>It was actually Mahiru who, along with her propensity for
        <p></p>touching him, had the highest destructive power.
        <p></p>The feeling of her soft body, the way her scent hung in the
        <p></p>air, and how she always gently smiled at him meant that
        <p></p>Amane's heart was always beating fast, like he was
        <p></p>constantly sprinting.
        <p></p>He could feel his heart thumping loudly from Mahiru's
        <p></p>loveliness. She must have noticed it, too, with her face
        <p></p>buried in his chest.
        <p></p>"…I always suspected that a surprise attack would be
        <p></p>more effective," Mahiru mumbled quietly as she pressed her
        <p></p>cheek tightly against his chest. "…But your heart is really
        <p></p>pounding hard, so as of today, I'm convinced of it," she
        <p></p>whispered, seeming very satisfied to know she had made his
        <p></p>heart race, and brushed her cheek against him.
        <p></p>The action was so sweet that Amane nearly groaned again.
        <p></p>He told himself to get a grip and stroked Mahiru's hair as a
        <p></p>way of redirecting the urges that arose inside of him.
        <p></p>After about five minutes, Mahiru seemed to be energized.
        <p></p>Seeing her flushed cheeks and watery eyes made Amane's
        <p></p>heart ache, but Mahiru appeared content, so he sequestered 1
        <p></p>his impatient feelings down deep in his chest.
        <p></p>"Well, should we get going?" Despite the morning distractions, they would be on time
        <p></p>for school, as they had given themselves plenty of time to
        <p></p>prepare. Even so, Amane wanted to leave soon, and when he
        <p></p>said so, Mahiru put on a smile and answered, "Yes." Her
        <p></p>skin was glowing.
        <p></p>It's only morning, and I'm already exhausted…
        <p></p>Amane didn't dislike the show of affection—actually, it
        <p></p>was just the opposite; he was so pleased by it that he was
        <p></p>wearing himself out by exercising all his self-restraint. If it
        <p></p>had been the weekend, he would have indulged Mahiru 2
        <p></p>further, but they had school, so he was unable to do as he
        <p></p>wished. 1
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't appear to have noticed Amane's
        <p></p>exhaustion. She seemed to be bursting with energy.
        <p></p>Even though he was a little tired from the morning's
        <p></p>various tribulations, it wasn't a bad sort of tiredness. Amane
        <p></p>smiled wryly, picked up his school bag, and he and Mahiru
        <p></p>stepped out the door together.
        <p></p>Feeling some strangely deep emotions about leaving the
        <p></p>house in school uniforms together for the first time, Amane
        <p></p>locked the door and looked over at Mahiru. She was
        <p></p>fidgeting nervously.
        <p></p>Her hand was still gripping the hem of his shirt.
        <p></p>"…Want to hold hands?"
        <p></p>"Yeah."
        <p></p>He had apparently guessed correctly. Looking at the
        <p></p>bashful Mahiru, he grumbled quietly, "You're so cute, damn," then casually took her backpack and slung it
        over his
        <p></p>own shoulder. With the opposite hand, he intertwined his
        <p></p>own fingers with Mahiru's.
        <p></p>She immediately looked up at him with eyes that said she
        <p></p>hadn't meant to make him carry her bag, but he whispered,
        <p></p>"I'm your boyfriend now, so you should let me do things like
        <p></p>this for you." 3
        <p></p>Mahiru pressed her lips tightly together in an adorable
        <p></p>expression of acceptance.
        <p></p>"You know, it feels kind of embarrassing to hold hands
        <p></p>like this again," Amane said.
        <p></p>They were leaving the apartment building and walking
        <p></p>their normal route to school, but they hadn't held hands like
        <p></p>this since their Golden Week outing, so there was a slight
        <p></p>awkwardness to it.
        <p></p>Rather than simply being her escort, Amane entwined his
        <p></p>fingers with Mahiru's, holding her hand in a gesture of
        <p></p>loving intimacy. They had held hands many times before,
        <p></p>but never like this, so he was naturally quite nervous.
        <p></p>He was worried about whether he was squeezing her hand
        <p></p>too tightly, or if his sweaty palms were making her
        <p></p>uncomfortable, but when he glanced over at Mahiru, she was
        <p></p>smiling cheerfully.
        <p></p>"It feels a little embarrassing, but I'm happy," she said.
        <p></p>"…Yeah."
        <p></p>"I've been wanting to go to school like this for a long time.
        <p></p>And finally being able to do that… I'm just…so happy." Walking to school side by side was such a trivial
        thing. But
        <p></p>apparently it was something Mahiru had been eagerly
        <p></p>anticipating, and her expression looked brighter than usual.
        <p></p>"And does that have much to do with me?"
        <p></p>Mahiru relaxed into a smile and mumbled timidly, "S-sure
        <p></p>it does… Because being with you is the reason why I'm
        <p></p>happy."
        <p></p>"…I see."
        <p></p>Amane felt his chest growing gradually hot as he realized
        <p></p>just how much she liked him.
        <p></p>He had been trying his best not to let his timidness show
        <p></p>on his face, but Mahiru seemed to notice, and her happy
        <p></p>smile broadened.
        <p></p>"So from now on, I'm going to be happy every day… I'm a
        <p></p>lucky girl."
        <p></p>"I feel like I should be the one saying that sort of thing."
        <p></p>"Well then, we're both happy, and that's cause for
        <p></p>celebration, don't you agree? We can finally enjoy it."
        <p></p>Mahiru giggled and leaned in close.
        <p></p>Taking care not to disturb Mahiru, Amane subtly shifted
        <p></p>so that there was still some room between them. With his
        <p></p>free hand, he gave her a pat on the head.
        <p></p>Although he had gotten used to walking while holding
        <p></p>hands, Amane was still uncomfortable getting too close in
        <p></p>public. Of course, he was glad to be near his girlfriend, but
        <p></p>he was worried about how it must look to other people if the two of them were too affectionate so early
        in the morning.
        <p></p>Trying not to let his uncertainty show on his face, Amane
        <p></p>squeezed Mahiru's dainty hand tightly, and they walked to
        <p></p>school with their arms pressed against each other.
        <p></p>It was the time of day where people would be commuting
        <p></p>to work or school, so there were a lot of students and people
        <p></p>in suits around. Amane was bothered by the thought that
        <p></p>they were all looking at them.
        <p></p>The closer they got to school, the more he felt like people
        <p></p>were staring.
        <p></p>"I can feel their eyes on us," Amane grumbled exhaustedly
        <p></p>in spite of himself.
        <p></p>They received a lot of different looks. Some people must
        <p></p>have been wondering who the boy walking hand in hand
        <p></p>with Mahiru was. Others were looking at the couple with
        <p></p>jealousy or envy in their eyes.
        <p></p>And while Amane had expected as much, actually
        <p></p>experiencing it was more uncomfortable than he had
        <p></p>imagined. At least not everybody who looked their way
        <p></p>seemed to disapprove, but as someone who had been
        <p></p>perfectly happy living a quiet, inconspicuous life, he was
        <p></p>certainly feeling unsettled.
        <p></p>"There's no helping it," Mahiru said. "At a glance, you
        <p></p>look like a changed man."
        <p></p>He and Mahiru, pressed close, were walking alongside
        <p></p>each other holding hands. Of course, calling attention to the
        <p></p>fact that they really were a couple was going to earn them
        <p></p>some stares from the other students on their way to school.But it was obvious that something had changed
        with Amane
        <p></p>since Sports Day, and although no one was asking who he
        <p></p>was out loud, they were watching with curious eyes.
        <p></p>"Do I really look that different?"
        <p></p>"Yes. How can I put it? You changed your hair, obviously,
        <p></p>but you're also standing up nice and straight, and you have a
        <p></p>confident expression, so the impression you make is
        <p></p>completely different."
        <p></p>"Sorry, I've always been a loser."
        <p></p>"Please don't put yourself down… You've always been
        <p></p>different. I like both versions of you, but I hate the Amane
        <p></p>who belittles himself."
        <p></p>"I'll be careful from now on; I don't like hearing that you
        <p></p>hate me."
        <p></p>"Very good."
        <p></p>Mahiru gave Amane a satisfied smile, and even more
        <p></p>stares came their way.
        <p></p>This time, some of them gave more menacing looks,
        <p></p>which made Amane's cheek twitch slightly, but they
        <p></p>disappeared as soon as Mahiru flashed a first-rate angelic
        <p></p>smile at the onlookers.
        <p></p>In some senses, the angel, unfazed by the attention of the
        <p></p>crowds, was the stronger of the two of them.
        <p></p>Amane adjusted his grip on Mahiru's hand and looked
        <p></p>straight ahead. He could still feel the prickle of staring eyes.
        <p></p>They would arrive at school very soon,
        <p></p>which meant even more people would be looking. Amane's shoulders
        <p></p>began to ache a little.
        <p></p>"If this is how people are staring now, it's gonna be really
        <p></p>annoying once we're in the classroom."
        <p></p>"Better come to terms with it… Or are you saying you hate
        <p></p>it?"
        <p></p>"I don't hate it. After all, I decided to change."
        <p></p>When Mahiru had confessed her feelings, Amane had
        <p></p>known he was going to have to change his life for the better.
        <p></p>He'd already made up his mind to improve himself so he
        <p></p>could be the kind of guy who was good enough to be
        <p></p>Mahiru's boyfriend—and a version of himself that he
        <p></p>wouldn't be ashamed of.
        <p></p>Amane readied himself, feeling a slight stomachache
        <p></p>coming on. He couldn't let himself slack off; he had to
        <p></p>become someone worthy of her.
        <p></p>"…Is that so?" Mahiru murmured, squeezing his fingers
        <p></p>tightly.
        <p></p>"Huh? Mahiru?"
        <p></p>Amane noticed Mahiru's ears had gone slightly red, and
        <p></p>he was about to point that out when a familiar, cutesy voice
        <p></p>called out from behind. They turned around and saw
        <p></p>Chitose, blinking dramatically in surprise.
        <p></p>Wearing an expression that could best be described as
        <p></p>dazed, Chitose looked Mahiru over, then shifted her gaze to
        <p></p>examine Amane. Chitose noticed their interlocked hands and smiled in
        <p></p>satisfaction, "Aha!" She trotted up to them and slapped
        <p></p>Amane on the back enthusiastically. "Good morning! So you 1
        <p></p>finally decided to make an appearance, mystery man?" 8
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>"Morning, Mahiru! I see everything went well!"
        <p></p>Chitose looked like she was in a great mood as she
        <p></p>slapped him again, fairly hard, with a wide smile.
        <p></p>So far they had only gotten looks of curiosity and jealousy,
        <p></p>so Amane's chest warmed just a little at this expression of
        <p></p>pure goodwill.
        <p></p>"Congratulations, Mahiru! I guess there was some use in
        <p></p>me always looking out for you!"
        <p></p>"I used your advice for all sorts of things."
        <p></p>"Sure did! Like what to do when Amane was being so
        <p></p>obtuse, and so on."
        <p></p>"…Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"W-well, you were really slow to realize…"
        <p></p>He wasn't able to make much of a counterargument.
        <p></p>It was his own fault for stubbornly failing to pick up on
        <p></p>the signals she had been sending out the whole time, so it
        <p></p>was no wonder she had consulted with Chitose.
        <p></p>"Well, it is Amane we're talking about, after all," Chitose
        <p></p>said as she looked him over again. He wasn't too happy about that appraisal. Chitose examined him
        closely,
        <p></p>probably because it was the first time she had ever seen him
        <p></p>style his hair properly."Wow, even so, I think this is the first time I've ever seen
        <p></p>Amane all dressed up like Mahiru's mystery man!"
        <p></p>"…What did you call me?"
        <p></p>"That's what Itsuki and Yuuta called it. Mm-hmm, you
        <p></p>know, you're not at Itsuki's level, but you still look pretty
        <p></p>good!"
        <p></p>Chitose smiled again and whacked him on the back. It was
        <p></p>her way of showing that she cared. Amane took this as
        <p></p>encouragement—and reassurance that he was the same as
        <p></p>always even if his outward appearance had changed—and his
        <p></p>lips curled slightly upward.
        <p></p>"So as far as you're concerned, Itsuki's number one,
        <p></p>right?"
        <p></p>"Of course he is! And you're Mahiru's number one, so no
        <p></p>complaints, right?"
        <p></p>"All right, as long as I'm in that position, I'm happy."
        <p></p>Amane had no interest in becoming Chitose's number
        <p></p>one. He was perfectly satisfied so long as Mahiru said he was
        <p></p>the most important person to her.
        <p></p>He glanced over at Mahiru, who was still holding his
        <p></p>hand. She put her face close to his arm and whispered
        <p></p>quietly, "…Amane is my number one." Maybe she was
        <p></p>slightly embarrassed to announce it in front of Chitose—her
        <p></p>cheeks flushed a bit.
        <p></p>"The blushing maiden! You're so cute, Mahiru. If Amane
        <p></p>wasn't here, I'd give you a big hug and shower you with love."
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah. That's not something to do on the way to
        <p></p>school; you can hug her all you want once we get to the
        <p></p>classroom."
        <p></p>"Huh? Yay! Mahiru, I got permission from your
        <p></p>boyfriend! I'm gonna squeeze you tight later!"
        <p></p>"Ah, o-okay, sure, just—be gentle…?"
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded with bewilderment once it was somehow
        <p></p>decided that she was going to get hugged, and Chitose
        <p></p>started walking along beside her, grinning from ear to ear.
        <p></p>She was probably eager to congratulate Mahiru.
        <p></p>Satisfied that the two of them were getting along
        <p></p>harmoniously, Amane turned away and started to look
        <p></p>around.
        <p></p>There were more eyes on them than ever before.
        <p></p>…Bet we're going to be hit with a barrage of questions
        <p></p>when we get to the classroom.
        <p></p>Amane smiled bitterly but made sure the two girls
        <p></p>wouldn't see it, as he imagined what would be coming soon
        <p></p>in several minutes under a deluge of stares.
        <p></p>Once they made it to the school building, they were met
        <p></p>with even more looks, and even though Chitose was by their
        <p></p>side, the sight of Amane and Mahiru holding hands and
        <p></p>walking down the hall naturally attracted a lot of attention.
        <p></p>Chitose reacted nonchalantly, "Whoa, you're really the
        <p></p>center of attention." But Amane wasn't accustomed to all the staring.
        <p></p>Mahiru strolled along confidently, accustomed to drawing
        <p></p>people's gazes. Their tightly clasped hands were in full view
        <p></p>—and the walk to the classroom was something like a public
        <p></p>debut.
        <p></p>As they proceeded down the hallway, Amane could hear
        <p></p>voices.
        <p></p>"The angel is with a guy…"
        <p></p>"Shiina looks different than usual…"
        <p></p>"Was there always a guy like that here?! That's a different
        <p></p>guy from the one at Sports Day, isn't it…?" 5
        <p></p>Of course, Amane was actually the same boy who Mahiru
        <p></p>had pointed out as her important person on Sports Day.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't respond to any of their comments, but she
        <p></p>did show her sweet, angelic smile to everyone around them.
        <p></p>"Amane?"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"We'll arrive soon. Are you doing all right?"
        <p></p>Mahiru posed the question as they approached their
        <p></p>classroom.
        <p></p>"We're already showing off that we're dating, and I've
        <p></p>prepared myself. I'll be fine."
        <p></p>"…Is that so?" "Everyone's gonna be so surprised!" Chitose interrupted.
        <p></p>"Imagine, Amane showing up all handsome the Monday
        <p></p>after Mahiru made that huge declaration. I was surprised,
        <p></p>too!" Chitose gave an easygoing smile.
        <p></p>Amane realized that he probably should have contacted
        <p></p>her and told her, as well as Itsuki and Yuuta, and felt slightly
        <p></p>regretful.
        <p></p>He had put it off because he'd felt awkward about
        <p></p>announcing that he and Mahiru had started dating, but
        <p></p>looking back, he was sure he ought to have informed the
        <p></p>friends who had been looking out for them first.
        <p></p>"…Chitose?"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"Sorry, um, for not letting you know."
        <p></p>"Nah, you got together after Sports Day was over, right? I
        <p></p>figured the two of you were busy making out, plus you're the
        <p></p>type who would rather tell us face-to-face and not over text
        <p></p>messages, so don't worry about it!"
        <p></p>Amane had mixed feelings about Chitose's certainty that
        <p></p>they had been "busy making out," but it was true that the 2
        <p></p>two of them had spent the previous day snuggled up
        <p></p>together, thinking of nothing else.
        <p></p>Besides, as Chitose had said, Amane had wanted to
        <p></p>personally share the news with his friends who had looked
        <p></p>out for them in various ways rather than over the phone.
        <p></p>And Chitose had figured it out before he'd said anything and
        <p></p>run up to tease them, so it was less of an announcement and
        <p></p>more like she was just confirming it was real. "…Thank you."
        <p></p>"My pleasure! Heh-heh, you should have a little more
        <p></p>respect for me; it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that I
        <p></p>was a central figure in hooking you two up!"
        <p></p>"Ha-ha. Allow me to repay the great Chitose with a crepe
        <p></p>from that place you like in front of the station sometime."
        <p></p>"I accept your offer!"
        <p></p>As Amane engaged in some banter with Chitose, he and
        <p></p>Mahiru arrived at the door to their classroom.
        <p></p>"Ah, good morning, Shii…na?"
        <p></p>The first to notice them were some girls who were
        <p></p>hanging out nearby.
        <p></p>They were sitting on their desks, talking excitedly about
        <p></p>something, but they looked up when they realized Mahiru
        <p></p>had entered the room…then noticed Amane holding her
        <p></p>hand.
        <p></p>Their eyes traveled from the clasped hands to Amane's
        <p></p>face.
        <p></p>The looks on the girls' faces showed that they were
        <p></p>wondering who he was.
        <p></p>That wasn't surprising, Amane had never dressed up in
        <p></p>front of his classmates before. Some of the girls in class had
        <p></p>probably seen him around town, but the Amane Fujimiya
        <p></p>they knew from school had never looked like that, so in their
        <p></p>eyes, he must have seemed like a stranger. However, the incident at Sports Day the week before,
        <p></p>where Mahiru made it public that Amane was her
        <p></p>"important person," was still fresh in everybody's minds.
        <p></p>And Amane had also admitted to being the guy they'd seen
        <p></p>with Mahiru during Golden Week.
        <p></p>If they put a little thought into it, they should have been
        <p></p>able to make the connection that the young man currently
        <p></p>holding hands with Mahiru was indeed Amane.
        <p></p>Before they had completed the mental calculus needed to
        <p></p>reach that conclusion, Amane let go of Mahiru's hand and
        <p></p>put his bag down on his desk.
        <p></p>He did it to show everyone very clearly who he was.
        <p></p>Once they realized, the classroom became quieter than
        <p></p>usual. Even the classmates who were usually bursting with
        <p></p>conversation had their eyes trained on Amane.
        <p></p>"Good morning, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>Just as the silence was starting to feel awkward, Yuuta 3
        <p></p>and Itsuki approached Amane, wearing their usual smiles.
        <p></p>He was suddenly extremely grateful for his two friends, 4
        <p></p>who not only recognized him but greeted him like they
        <p></p>always did.
        <p></p>"Mornin', guys."
        <p></p>"What's going on, Amane? Did you finally accept your
        <p></p>fate?"
        <p></p>"Come on, Yuuta, that's no way to put it… It's more like,
        <p></p>he caught her, but he got caught as well." Amane had consulted with the two of them many times.
        <p></p>And Itsuki had been the first one to recognize that he had
        <p></p>feelings for Mahiru. The two boys had been able to tell what
        <p></p>was going on the instant Amane and Mahiru had walked into
        <p></p>the classroom holding hands, especially with Amane having
        <p></p>styled his hair in what they had named his "mystery man"
        <p></p>look.
        <p></p>"Congratulations, Fujimiya. We've only become friends
        <p></p>recently, so I can't say it's actually been that long, but I was
        <p></p>starting to get impatient. I'm excited that it's finally
        <p></p>happening."
        <p></p>"You don't know the half of it, Yuuta! I've been looking
        <p></p>out for him for like half a year. There's a limit to how much a
        <p></p>guy can take, waitin' on this coward!"
        <p></p>"Oh, well, I'm sooo sorry to make you two wait," Amane
        <p></p>answered sarcastically.
        <p></p>Itsuki nodded seriously and mumbled, "It took you long
        <p></p>enough." It seemed like his friend might have actually gotten
        <p></p>rather emotional after watching Amane and Mahiru dance
        <p></p>around each other for the past six months.
        <p></p>For better or worse, Itsuki had helped Amane and pushed
        <p></p>him along—more accurately, kicked him forward—so Amane
        <p></p>was grateful. Itsuki had been a little too meddlesome
        <p></p>sometimes, but even so, he had always been there to
        <p></p>encourage Amane whenever he was at a standstill. Among
        <p></p>all their friends, Itsuki was probably the one who was most
        <p></p>invested in their new relationship.
        <p></p>"So you made up your mind to go with that look, huh?"
        <p></p>"Yeah." "Man, it seems weird; I'm not used to seeing you done up
        <p></p>like that."
        <p></p>"You're right. I only got to see it the other day."
        <p></p>Yuuta had seen Amane dressed up for Golden Week
        <p></p>almost a month ago. But that had been the only time, so
        <p></p>Amane wasn't surprised that his friends weren't used to it
        <p></p>yet. The only one who was used to it was Mahiru.
        <p></p>Speaking of Mahiru, Chitose was hanging all over her,
        <p></p>rubbing her head teasingly as their other classmates shuffled
        <p></p>over to swarm around them. Amane was some distance
        <p></p>away, but the classroom was so quiet that he could hear
        <p></p>what they were asking her. Even if he hadn't, though, he
        <p></p>could have guessed what they were discussing.
        <p></p>"Hey, Fujimiya!"
        <p></p>As Amane was staring sympathetically in Mahiru's
        <p></p>direction, someone else called his name.
        <p></p>When he turned toward the voice, several girls had
        <p></p>surrounded him. They were looking him over, not even
        <p></p>attempting to hide the immense curiosity in their eyes.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't very good at dealing with the opposite sex, 5
        <p></p>so situations like this had always been bad for his stomach.
        <p></p>However, he had been steeling himself for something like
        <p></p>this to happen, so he answered without letting his inner
        <p></p>thoughts show.
        <p></p>"…What is it?"
        <p></p>"Wow, it really is Fujimiya! You look a bit different, so we
        <p></p>were surprised!" "Yeah, this is a totally new look!"
        <p></p>"It really is! Before, you were pretty plain!"
        <p></p>"Whoa, it's rude to call him plain."
        <p></p>"Ah, sorry, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>"It's fine; you're not wrong," Amane said with a wry smile.
        <p></p>He was almost overwhelmed by the energy of the girls but
        <p></p>tried his best not to get swept away.
        <p></p>What they were saying was the truth, so he didn't argue
        <p></p>back or get angry about it. He was the one who chose to be
        <p></p>plain, and personality-wise, he had never wanted to stand
        <p></p>out, so in class, he had remained the quiet person who was
        <p></p>always just kind of there.
        <p></p>Anyone in this class would have viewed him as reserved
        <p></p>and unremarkable.
        <p></p>That had suddenly changed, so it was understandable
        <p></p>there was some confusion.
        <p></p>"You really committed to a new style, huh?" one of the
        <p></p>girls asked.
        <p></p>"Guess so," he answered. "Is it weird?"
        <p></p>"Not at all! I think you look much better."
        <p></p>"Actually, you're hot now; I was surprised!" 2
        <p></p>"Well, if you think so, then it must have been worth the
        <p></p>effort."
        <p></p>All their compliments made Amane feel pretty embarrassed, but it wouldn't do him any good to disagree—
        <p></p>he had learned that being too humble could become a toxic
        <p></p>habit over time, so he gratefully accepted the compliments.
        <p></p>He nodded, trying his best to maintain a gentle
        <p></p>expression, and the girls laughed like they were enjoying
        <p></p>themselves.
        <p></p>"Hey, hey, can I ask you one thing?"
        <p></p>"As long as it's something I can answer, go ahead," he
        <p></p>replied.
        <p></p>Finally, here it comes.
        <p></p>It was a question someone was bound to ask sooner or
        <p></p>later, so he planned to answer now, to make the situation
        <p></p>clear.
        <p></p>The rest of their classmates seemed to be straining their
        <p></p>ears to hear, so if he made the announcement here, it was
        <p></p>sure to circulate throughout the school.
        <p></p>"Are you and Mahiru dating? I heard you came to school
        <p></p>holding hands today…"
        <p></p>"Yes, we started dating last week. Thanks for asking." 1
        <p></p>When he clearly affirmed their suspicions, a chorus of
        <p></p>shrill shrieks filled the room. He thought he could also hear
        <p></p>the boys behind him making noises of despair and
        <p></p>resentment, but he ignored them.
        <p></p>At any rate, he was sure the boys would have their own
        <p></p>questions later, so Amane decided he would deal with them
        <p></p>then."Wha—? How did you get with Shiina…?"
        <p></p>"We've shared a connection since last year. We just
        <p></p>naturally became close. Right, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>Mahiru approached with a smile. That didn't mean that
        <p></p>the barrage of questions was over, but maybe she had
        <p></p>concluded that it would speed things along if the girls saw
        <p></p>her conversing with Amane.
        <p></p>She moved over next to him and stood close enough that
        <p></p>it was hard to tell if they were touching, then flashed a lovely
        <p></p>smile at the girls who had been interrogating him.
        <p></p>"It's difficult to explain, but all sorts of things happened
        <p></p>between us, and we became a couple. My feelings had been
        <p></p>unrequited for a long time, so I'm very, very happy… So I
        <p></p>was sort of bragging. That's why we came in holding hands."
        <p></p>Just like when they were walking to school, Mahiru placed
        <p></p>her hand on Amane's, and he smiled slightly and squeezed
        <p></p>her hand.
        <p></p>"Actually, I think I was the one who fell for you first,"
        <p></p>Amane said.
        <p></p>"Oh, I'm sure I was first," Mahiru teased. "Well, in either
        <p></p>case, you took forever to confess."
        <p></p>"I do regret that; I feel sorry about it. But I've made my
        <p></p>intentions clear, so please forgive me."
        <p></p>"…I believe I was the one who took the first step, though." "Next time, I'll be sure to do it right."
        <p></p>"Do what, exactly?" 2
        <p></p>"…I…uh…guess we'll see."
        <p></p>If Mahiru was thinking about what the next step in their
        <p></p>relationship might be, she didn't show it… She just acted like
        <p></p>it was a mystery.
        <p></p>Amane had something in mind, but it wasn't the kind of
        <p></p>thing he was going to say out loud. He didn't even feel like
        <p></p>he was old enough for something so serious just yet, so he 2
        <p></p>tucked the thought away in a far corner of his mind. Amane
        <p></p>was certain his feelings for Mahiru would never fade or
        <p></p>change, no matter how many years went by. He intended to 2
        <p></p>be the one to ask her, when the time was right, so he decided
        <p></p>that the whole matter could wait.
        <p></p>Mahiru gave Amane a dissatisfied look when he dodged
        <p></p>her question, but he stroked her hair, and she seemed to be
        <p></p>mollified.
        <p></p>"…You're avoiding the issue again." 2
        <p></p>"I'll say it someday; be patient."
        <p></p>"Always making me wait."
        <p></p>She sounded disappointed, but her expression was one of
        <p></p>pure delight.
        <p></p>But then she seemed to realize something, and she quickly
        <p></p>covered her face with her hands as she flushed bright red.
        <p></p>Amane wondered what had caused her to do that, but when
        <p></p>he looked around the room, he saw their classmates staring,
        <p></p>speechless.
        <p></p>They were all staring at Amane and Mahiru. 1
        <p></p>—Oops. 2
        <p></p>Sure, he had been meaning to show off his relationship
        <p></p>with Mahiru and cement his standing as her boyfriend, but
        <p></p>he hadn't meant for them to have the kind of conversation 1
        <p></p>they usually had at home in front of everybody. 4
        <p></p>Out of habit, he patted her head without thinking, and it
        <p></p>was easy to see what their classmates thought of him
        <p></p>touching her like that.
        <p></p>"…Watch out, Amane—you're flirting, and you don't even
        <p></p>realize it."
        <p></p>Even Itsuki was telling him to dial it back—and he was
        <p></p>one half of the original "cringe couple."
        <p></p>Flustered, Amane removed his hand from Mahiru's head
        <p></p>and bit down on his lip in an attempt to keep his cheeks
        <p></p>from heating up.
        <p></p>In the blink of an eye, news that Amane and Mahiru had
        <p></p>started dating spread throughout the school. For better or
        <p></p>worse, thanks to some gossipy classmates and their display
        <p></p>of affection on the way to school, the rumors were
        <p></p>confirmed.
        <p></p>Whenever Amane walked down the hall, he would hear
        <p></p>people whispering, so he felt extremely uncomfortable.
        <p></p>"Well, I'm sure it'll die down in a few days," Makoto said,
        <p></p>gazing at the uproar, one step back from the crowd. "I'm sure it will." Kazuya nodded. "Ultimately,
        people get
        <p></p>bored of talking about the same thing over and over. And
        <p></p>something else will come along, and everyone will forget all
        <p></p>about it."
        <p></p>"I sure hope you're right," Amane groaned. "It's gonna be
        <p></p>awful if every day is like this."
        <p></p>Even during break times, people were whispering things
        <p></p>at a distance, and it really bothered him.
        <p></p>"Well, I'm sure the questions will stop eventually, but you
        <p></p>might find yourself getting swarmed for another reason soon
        <p></p>enough," Makoto said.
        <p></p>"Another reason?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"I think you might be considered a hot commodity now."
        <p></p>"But I'm already taken."
        <p></p>He was already thinking about his future with Mahiru, so
        <p></p>even if another girl tried to catch his eye, he was sure
        <p></p>nothing would happen. Nobody could compete with Mahiru
        <p></p>for his attention. He couldn't imagine choosing anyone over
        <p></p>her.
        <p></p>What Amane didn't want was for people to think he might
        <p></p>be insincere. The thought really bothered him.
        <p></p>"Well, there are times when love isn't logical."
        <p></p>"Hmm, it's rare to hear you say something like that,
        <p></p>Makoto," Kazuya remarked.
        <p></p>"How rude. You know, I bet it's impossible to ignore your feelings, if you really, really like someone,
        even if you know
        <p></p>they're already taken. Love is like a reflex, or something. Of 3
        <p></p>course, sometimes you can't act on that impulsiveness,
        <p></p>though," Makoto continued as he looked over at a group of
        <p></p>girls who were huddled together chatting, then sighed.
        <p></p>"Well, I don't think the two of you have anything to worry
        <p></p>about," he added.
        <p></p>"I agree," said Kazuya. "Flaunting it in front of everybody
        <p></p>the way that you two did will probably discourage anyone
        <p></p>else from trying. But you know, Amane, I never would have
        <p></p>thought you'd act like that in public."
        <p></p>"Please forget about that…!"
        <p></p>Amane was struck with embarrassment thinking about his
        <p></p>exchange with Mahiru that morning. They had been trying
        <p></p>to make it clear that they were together, but Amane had
        <p></p>certainly not meant to pat Mahiru's head or come as close as
        <p></p>he had to letting on that he was already thinking about
        <p></p>marriage. 1
        <p></p>Mahiru had done her best to deflect the attention, but
        <p></p>Itsuki and Makoto had apparently noticed anyway. They'd
        <p></p>made some astonished remarks about how in love the couple
        <p></p>must be.
        <p></p>"Well, Amane, now everyone knows you're the only one
        <p></p>who gets to see that side of Shiina. That counts as a win, at
        <p></p>least?"
        <p></p>"…You're probably right, but even so, it's still pretty
        <p></p>embarrassing."
        <p></p>"Says the guy who came to school holding her hand." "That's different," Amane insisted. That kind of
        thing was
        <p></p>a lot more mortifying when it was unintentional.
        <p></p>"Aw, you shouldn't feel down. Actually, I bet there are
        <p></p>some people who are grateful you made such a scene."
        <p></p>"Grateful?"
        <p></p>"Sure, the rest of the girls will be happy that all the boys
        <p></p>who had their eyes on Shiina will finally start looking
        <p></p>elsewhere."
        <p></p>The thought had actually crossed Amane's mind already.
        <p></p>Not every girl in their class looked up to Mahiru. Amane
        <p></p>knew some of them had complicated feelings toward her, at
        <p></p>least in part because she monopolized the attention of the
        <p></p>boys in their class. Mahiru had always been single,
        <p></p>unattainable, and had shown no one any affection, but now
        <p></p>that she told everyone she had a special relationship with
        <p></p>Amane and made it clear that she didn't have eyes for
        <p></p>anyone else, some of the animosity the girls held toward her
        <p></p>seemed to have subsided.
        <p></p>"It must be hard for girls to deal with all that stuff,"
        <p></p>Amane remarked. "Well, now that that's settled, I hope
        <p></p>Mahiru can be just one of the girls. She felt so embarrassed
        <p></p>being called an angel; she honestly hated it."
        <p></p>"She really did hate that, huh?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, no surprise there. Even Yuuta makes a face when
        <p></p>you call him a prince."
        <p></p>In his heart, Amane said a little prayer for Yuuta, who
        <p></p>probably had the same problems as Mahiru. "…What are you guys talking about?" Mahiru was headed
        <p></p>their way. She must have finished her conversation with
        <p></p>Chitose.
        <p></p>Although it seemed like she hadn't heard what the boys
        <p></p>had been discussing, Mahiru saw that Amane was blushing
        <p></p>and realized someone must have reminded him of their
        <p></p>interaction that morning. She gave the three of them, Amane
        <p></p>included, a suspicious look.
        <p></p>"Oh, Shiina? We weren't discussing anything particularly
        <p></p>important. We were talking about how you're just one of the
        <p></p>girls now."
        <p></p>"And how on earth did you arrive at that topic…?" Mahiru
        <p></p>asked.
        <p></p>"Ah, well, um…," Amane stammered, "…we were just
        <p></p>talking about how everyone seems to have finally realized
        <p></p>that you're not some angel; you're just an ordinary girl."
        <p></p>Amane and the other boys explained their conversation to
        <p></p>Mahiru, putting aside what had happened that morning.
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded. "I see. You know, I was always aware that
        <p></p>some people…idolized me. So I'm sure what you said is
        <p></p>probably true," she said, keeping her voice down.
        <p></p>Makoto and Kazuya both made faces that said they
        <p></p>understood perfectly.
        <p></p>They had been friends with Yuuta for a long time, so they
        <p></p>most likely had seen all sorts of things along the way. They
        <p></p>probably had been concerned about Mahiru as well, who had
        <p></p>been going through almost the same sort of problems. "But I'm not really worried about what other people
        say
        <p></p>about me anymore," Mahiru added.
        <p></p>"Oh, really?"
        <p></p>"Nope… As long as I'm the only girl for Amane, nothing
        <p></p>else matters," she replied quietly.
        <p></p>Only Amane, Makoto, and Kazuya were close enough to
        <p></p>hear her.
        <p></p>But her words had been imbued with a great deal of
        <p></p>destructive power.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't the only one who was enchanted by
        <p></p>Mahiru's wide and bashful smile, with her slightly flushed
        <p></p>cheeks.
        <p></p>Makoto and Kazuya made noises of surprise, and the
        <p></p>other students who had been glancing at them occasionally
        <p></p>also stared at Mahiru with their mouths hanging open.
        <p></p>"Fujimiya, do something about your girlfriend…," his 3
        <p></p>friends groaned.
        <p></p>Amane knew they were right, but even so, he couldn't do
        <p></p>anything about the collateral damage, and anyway, he was
        <p></p>the one suffering the worst of it, so he was busy desperately
        <p></p>trying to calm down his pounding heart.
        <p></p>"…You're really in deep, huh?" Makoto murmured in 4
        <p></p>exasperation.
        <p></p>Her cheeks still bright red, Mahiru smiled even wider and
        <p></p>nodded.

        <p></p>Chapter 56: Interrogation Over Lunch
        <p></p>"Amane, what do you want to do for lunch?"
        <p></p>When morning classes were over, Mahiru approached
        <p></p>Amane's seat carrying a bag with two lunch boxes in it.
        <p></p>He had been planning to eat lunch with the usual group
        <p></p>but now found himself hesitating somewhat, worried it
        <p></p>might cause them trouble.
        <p></p>Incidentally, Makoto and Kazuya had been eating with
        <p></p>them lately, but the two of them had already firmly refused
        <p></p>to join them that day, on the grounds that they didn't want
        <p></p>to put themselves in the line of fire. Sadly, it was undeniable
        <p></p>that Amane and Mahiru had been making things even worse
        <p></p>during the breaks between classes.
        <p></p>"Hmm, well, if Itsuki and the others don't mind, I'd like to
        <p></p>eat together, but—" Amane hesitated.
        <p></p>"Did you think we were actually going to abandon you?"
        <p></p>Itsuki, Chitose, and Yuuta joined Amane and Mahiru.
        <p></p>They already had their wallets out.
        <p></p>Itsuki grinned bitterly. "Don't be a stranger, man. We'll
        <p></p>eat together like we always do."
        <p></p>"Itsuki…"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"After all, you two are liable to get into trouble without a
        <p></p>chaperone, so you could almost say it's my responsibility to
        <p></p>be there."
        <p></p>"…I've got mixed feelings about that," Amane grumbled.
        <p></p>But he understood what Itsuki was getting at as he
        <p></p>remembered how careless he and Mahiru had been earlier in
        <p></p>the day. It obviously wasn't intentional, but he wouldn't
        <p></p>deny that either Mahiru or he could slip up again.
        <p></p>Itsuki's concern wasn't entirely misplaced. "Well, in any
        <p></p>case, we're doing the usual," he said.
        <p></p>"I actually want to see Mahiru be more aggressive, so I
        <p></p>don't mind," Chitose said. "As far as I'm concerned, you two
        <p></p>can go for it."
        <p></p>Yuuta chimed in. "I think it would be…awkward for the
        <p></p>rest of us, if you were to make a big show of your intimacy…
        <p></p>you know?"
        <p></p>"You too, Kadowaki…?"
        <p></p>"It would be embarrassing for those of us who'd have to
        <p></p>watch," Yuuta continued. "At the same time, you two seem
        <p></p>happy, and that's the most important thing," he said with a
        <p></p>smile.
        <p></p>Amane was left speechless by Yuuta's heartfelt
        <p></p>endorsement.
        <p></p>"Though some of us would appreciate it if you showed at
        <p></p>least a little restraint," Yuuta added.
        <p></p>Amane had gotten that sense after seeing Makoto's and
        <p></p>Kazuya's reactions, so he nodded seriously.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…So the cafeteria's okay, yeah? I mean, I don't have a
        <p></p>lunch box, so I'm going there anyway."
        <p></p>"Sounds good," Amane agreed.
        <p></p>"All right, let's get going. I wonder what the special is
        <p></p>today?"
        <p></p>"I think it's fried chicken."
        <p></p>"Oh, sweet! The fried chicken they serve here is so light
        <p></p>and crispy; it's so good."
        <p></p>Itsuki walked off, waving his wallet and grinning broadly.
        <p></p>Amane felt grateful and followed him.
        <p></p>"…Here, Amane, take your lunch box."
        <p></p>Once the five of them had taken their seats in the cafeteria
        <p></p>and gotten their food, Mahiru pulled a lunch box out of her
        <p></p>bag and offered it to Amane.
        <p></p>His was one size larger than Mahiru's, which she pulled
        <p></p>out next, and his held quite a bit more food. It was enough to
        <p></p>satisfy the appetite of a high school boy rather than a girl
        <p></p>who usually didn't eat very much.
        <p></p>"Mm, thanks."
        <p></p>"Aw, Mahiru made you lunch, how nice!"
        <p></p>"I'm not giving you any."
        <p></p>"Stingy!" Chitose puffed out her cheeks in feigned anger.
        <p></p>"Why don't you swap a little with me?" Mahiru offered,
        <p></p>and immediately, the balloon of Chitose's cheeks deflated.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>It was a childish performance, but it matched perfectly
        <p></p>with Chitose's carefree attitude, and Itsuki also smiled as he
        <p></p>looked on.
        <p></p>Amane lifted the lid of his lunch box as he listened to the
        <p></p>girls.
        <p></p>The inside was packed with the remainders of the
        <p></p>previous day's chicken-and-tomato stew, spinach and corn
        <p></p>sauteed in butter and soy sauce, steamed broccoli and mini
        <p></p>tomatoes, wieners cut neatly into the shape of little
        <p></p>octopuses, and Amane's favorite dish, rolled omelets.
        <p></p>Knowing Amane's appetite, Mahiru had been sure to
        <p></p>include plenty of the main dish. He basically ate anything,
        <p></p>and liked vegetables, too, but he had a bigger appetite when
        <p></p>there was meat involved. On top of that, she had added
        <p></p>rolled omelets, his favorite food, so Amane was excited.
        <p></p>"I put a lot of your favorite dish in yours, Amane, is that
        <p></p>all right?"
        <p></p>"That omelet is the only thing that's gonna get me through
        <p></p>the afternoon."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"You're exaggerating."
        <p></p>"No, I mean it."
        <p></p>Amane loved egg dishes and found an omelet even more
        <p></p>satisfying than meat. So an extra-large portion of it was
        <p></p>exactly what he wanted.
        <p></p>"Thanks for the meal," Amane said, showing his
        <p></p>appreciation for Mahiru and the food, and immediately
        <p></p>extending his chopsticks toward the omelet.
        <p></p>When he put it in his mouth, it felt soft, and when he bit
        <p></p>down, the harmony between the rich taste of the dashi and
        <p></p>the slight sweetness of the sugar spread gently through his
        <p></p>mouth, and his lips curled into a smile.
        <p></p>It was so delicious that it would have been a waste to
        <p></p>swallow right away, so he chewed slowly and savored the
        <p></p>taste.
        <p></p>People did say it was important to chew your food well,
        <p></p>and he also really felt like he wanted to enjoy it as long as he
        <p></p>could.
        <p></p>The egg was as delicious as always, and as Amane ate
        <p></p>without attempting to hide the look of rapture on his face,
        <p></p>Yuuta watched him and let out an astonished squawk.
        <p></p>"…You make it look really delicious, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>"It really is."
        <p></p>"I can tell. If you can make Amane look that happy when
        <p></p>he's eating, you must be really blessed, Shiina."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>With a smile, Mahiru had been watching Amane. When
        <p></p>Yuuta turned to her, her cheeks flushed slightly, and she
        <p></p>smiled. "Yes, indeed, I'm very grateful that he always tells
        <p></p>me how tasty my cooking is. It's worth the effort—really it
        <p></p>is."
        <p></p>"I'm glad that you made it for me, and trust me, it's
        <p></p>delicious."
        <p></p>"I've got a good grasp on your tastes now, Amane, and I
        <p></p>want to concentrate on cooking stuff you like."
        <p></p>"You're doing fine as it is, I'd say."
        <p></p>"Since I'm going to the trouble, I want to match your
        <p></p>tastes perfectly."
        <p></p>"I like everything you make. As long as you cook it,
        <p></p>anything is delicious."
        <p></p>Amane hoped to be with Mahiru for a long time, so he
        <p></p>didn't want her to cook just to suit his preferences but also
        <p></p>to make things she enjoyed eating.
        <p></p>Rather than matching every meal to his tastes, he wanted
        <p></p>to compare and adjust dishes until they found something
        <p></p>that was just right for the two of them together—and also try
        <p></p>foods Mahiru liked as well.
        <p></p>As Amane tossed a wiener carved with a smiley face into
        <p></p>his mouth, he nodded seriously; Mahiru made an anxious
        <p></p>face and hunched over.
        <p></p>When he saw that her cheeks had taken on a slight tinge
        <p></p>of red, he looked up at the other people around the table and
        <p></p>saw Itsuki looking astonished.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"You're not even gonna give me a chance to keep you from
        <p></p>flirting, eh?"
        <p></p>"…We're not flirting," Amane replied.
        <p></p>"Says you… Tch."
        <p></p>"Wait, so you're saying that this is only the lead-in?"
        <p></p>Chitose asked. "This doesn't even count as flirting yet?"
        <p></p>"You guys…," Amane groaned.
        <p></p>"Well, I guess compared to your exchange in the
        <p></p>classroom earlier, this isn't as bad," Itsuki said. "I can't
        <p></p>blame you for staking your claim, either. If nothing else, you
        <p></p>definitely let everyone know that there isn't the tiniest gap
        <p></p>where they can butt in between you two."
        <p></p>At those words, Amane shifted his gaze from his friends to
        <p></p>the cafeteria seats surrounding them. He noticed that many
        <p></p>of the boys, both their peers and some upperclassmen, were
        <p></p>looking his way.
        <p></p>They were practically glaring at him with undisguised
        <p></p>contempt, although whenever Mahiru glanced in their
        <p></p>direction, they were quick to avert their eyes.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure whether he should be embarrassed
        <p></p>that everyone had overheard their conversation or grateful
        <p></p>that they had managed to rein it in.
        <p></p>Yuuta frowned. "And here I was certain that they were
        <p></p>doing it on purpose…," he grumbled. "…But seriously, it's
        <p></p>great that you're so close. Just remember that it's easy for
        <p></p>others to peer into your little world, so maybe be a little
        <p></p>more discreet," he cautioned. "Though it does seem to have
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>been effective…" Yuuta sounded slightly exasperated as he
        <p></p>added that last part.
        <p></p>Amane could only grimace in response.
        <p></p>"…Wh-what's with the crowd, guys?"
        <p></p>Upon returning to the classroom after lunch, Amane
        <p></p>found himself swarmed by the other boys in his class.
        <p></p>Mahiru was not in her seat—she'd apparently gone to buy
        <p></p>drinks with Chitose. Itsuki and Yuuta saw that Amane was
        <p></p>being surrounded and told him to resign himself to an
        <p></p>interrogation before promptly turning their attention to
        <p></p>preparing for the next class.
        <p></p>Amane cursed them for being so insensitive, but he knew
        <p></p>that if he was going to continue dating Mahiru, he'd have to
        <p></p>learn to deal with this sort of thing himself. So he let out a
        <p></p>quiet sigh and allowed the boys in his class to encircle him.
        <p></p>Surprisingly, they didn't seem to be mad at Amane in
        <p></p>particular. It was more like they simply needed to vent their
        <p></p>frustrations at him.
        <p></p>"Incredible, the theft of the century! You've stolen our
        <p></p>angel!"
        <p></p>"…You're overstating it, plus Mahiru never belonged to
        <p></p>any of you in the first place."
        <p></p>"I'm so jealous; you get to eat the angel's handmade
        <p></p>lunches!"
        <p></p>"…Well, we are dating, so you can't really complain about
        <p></p>that."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"I can't believe you got someone so out of your league, just
        <p></p>like that."
        <p></p>"…It wasn't exactly easy, you know."
        <p></p>Complaints were flying at him from every direction, but
        <p></p>all of them were just sulky and benign. He could hear some
        <p></p>small tinges of jealousy, but they weren't shouting their
        <p></p>objections to the relationship itself, so Itsuki, who kept
        <p></p>sneaking glances over to watch, flashed an infuriating smile
        <p></p>and looked away again. Clearly, he did not intend to offer
        <p></p>any help for the time being.
        <p></p>"So how did you and Shiina get to know each other in the
        <p></p>first place? You mentioned you've been hanging out since
        <p></p>last year, but what did you guys even have in common?"
        <p></p>"Ah, well, how do I explain…? I just happened to lend her
        <p></p>an umbrella when she was caught in the rain. A lot has
        <p></p>happened since then, but that was the reason we started
        <p></p>spending time together."
        <p></p>"That's all?!"
        <p></p>"Th-that's all? I mean, well, after that we got to know each
        <p></p>other, and Mahiru couldn't stand that I was such a slob, so
        <p></p>she started taking care of me."
        <p></p>"You sure are a lucky guy!"
        <p></p>"Well, I won't deny that."
        <p></p>Quite the series of coincidences had brought them
        <p></p>together.
        <p></p>If Mahiru hadn't gotten a phone call from her mother that
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>day, or if Amane hadn't noticed his surroundings, or if he
        <p></p>had taken a hot shower after lending her his umbrella like he
        <p></p>should have, or if he'd displayed any kind of ulterior
        <p></p>motives, Amane's and Mahiru's fates would never have
        <p></p>become linked. If just one of those elements had turned out
        <p></p>differently, their present relationship probably never would
        <p></p>have come to be.
        <p></p>And so he had no doubt that the fact they formed a
        <p></p>connection was nothing short of a small miracle.
        <p></p>Amane shrugged and chuckled while frowning anxiously,
        <p></p>and the classmate in front of him sighed quietly.
        <p></p>"…I don't mean to put you down, but I don't understand
        <p></p>why the angel fell for you, Fujimiya. If it was a matter of
        <p></p>looks or brains, surely there would be other choices. Now we
        <p></p>know how you met, but what caused her to start liking you?"
        <p></p>"I honestly have no idea why she likes me—or even when
        <p></p>she started…"
        <p></p>Amane knew she cared about him, but he did not
        <p></p>specifically understand when Mahiru had started having
        <p></p>feelings for him. He didn't know how to respond to their
        <p></p>questions as Mahiru was probably the only one who knew
        <p></p>the answers.
        <p></p>Amane could only smile ambiguously, and a few of his
        <p></p>classmates—the ones who had started speaking to him since
        <p></p>he'd helped them during Mahiru's study session the week
        <p></p>prior—laughed a little.
        <p></p>"Well, I wonder if it isn't this? Fujimiya is a calm guy, he
        <p></p>really pays attention to the people around him, and he's
        <p></p>always looking out for everyone. Maybe that's why?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Shiina doesn't seem like she would go for the boisterous
        <p></p>type, so maybe you're right. She would probably prefer
        <p></p>someone who makes her feel at ease when they spend time
        <p></p>together over someone who's more energetic, right? And
        <p></p>Fujimiya can be blunt, but he wouldn't make fun of his
        <p></p>partner or do hurtful stuff on purpose. He's probably nice to
        <p></p>be around."
        <p></p>"Actually, now that I think about it, Fujimiya has always
        <p></p>been concerned about Shiina, hasn't he? That was true at the
        <p></p>study session, and during cooking class, and at Sports Day,
        <p></p>too. He's always been watching out for her, like a
        <p></p>gentleman."
        <p></p>"That is a very Fujimiya-like way of taking care of Shiina."
        <p></p>Two of Amane's classmates talked about him like he
        <p></p>wasn't even there.
        <p></p>Amane could feel himself getting flustered, and he glared
        <p></p>at them. "Seriously… Imano, Yamazaki, gimme a break."
        <p></p>But his classmates showed no signs of flinching back from
        <p></p>Amane's piercing gaze.
        <p></p>"He's probably trying to hide his embarrassment."
        <p></p>"So he's not being up-front with us, I see."
        <p></p>"You guys…"
        <p></p>Just as Amane was thinking that he might have preferred
        <p></p>it if they had been making fun of him rather than singing his
        <p></p>praises, he heard a familiar voice, laughing from outside the
        <p></p>circle.

        <p></p>"Ah-ha-ha! Well, Amane's a hard nut to crack, but he is
        <p></p>nice, and pretty gentle, which couldn't have hurt with
        <p></p>Mahiru."
        <p></p>"That's right… What are you doing here, Shirakawa?!"
        <p></p>Chitose, who hadn't been in the classroom until now, had
        <p></p>suddenly poked her head in.
        <p></p>"Huh? Lunch break is almost over, and I got a tip that
        <p></p>while we were gone, you guys ganged up on Amane, so we
        <p></p>came back to check it out. By the way, Mahiru herself is
        <p></p>here, too, guys."
        <p></p>"S-sorry."
        <p></p>Mahiru, the focus of the conversation, apologized as she
        <p></p>returned.
        <p></p>The students still had afternoon classes to get through, so
        <p></p>of course Mahiru would return to the classroom, and she
        <p></p>would notice them talking about her when she did. That
        <p></p>should have been obvious, but it didn't seem to have
        <p></p>occurred to anyone.
        <p></p>When Amane glanced over in Itsuki's direction, Itsuki
        <p></p>waved his smartphone. Apparently he had been the one to
        <p></p>call the girls back. Amane didn't know whether he should be
        <p></p>grateful or angry that Itsuki hadn't jumped into the
        <p></p>conversation himself.
        <p></p>Mahiru saw that Amane was surrounded, and she put on
        <p></p>an anxious smile as she walked over to him. Mahiru, who
        <p></p>had spent the day completely attached to his side, ignored
        <p></p>the eyes fixed on her.

        <p></p>"Sounds like you haven't been straightforward with
        <p></p>them," she told Amane. "…It's hard to put an answer into
