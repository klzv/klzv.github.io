        was as silky as it had been the night before. He almost wanted to go on touching her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        forever. In the back of his mind, he knew he needed to be delicate, but the softness of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her skin was spellbinding and made him want to dote on her…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru, who had been sleeping quietly, suddenly let out a hoarse but endearing groan<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and looked at Amane with bleary, caramel-coloured eyes… or at least, she seemed to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        look in Amane's direction. He thought that her cherubic face appeared even more<p></p>
        <p></p>
        innocent in repose. She stared absently for a moment, eyes blank and cloudy with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sleep, and then frowned and settled back down.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Amane started to pull his hand away, Mahiru stirred, and her cheek brushed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        against his fingers again. "…Nn…" A dainty sigh rose in her throat.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        To Amane, it almost seemed like she was saying Don't go.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Of course, Mahiru was obviously still half asleep. She would definitely never act like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        this under any normal circumstances.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even so, Amane thought that her movements reminded him of an affectionate kitten.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The day had only just begun, and already his brain was failing him. He couldn't decide<p></p>
        <p></p>
        whether to pull back or keep caressing her cheek. Despite all sense and reason, his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        heart was really leaning toward the latter. After all, he rarely got to see Mahiru this<p></p>
        <p></p>
        unguarded, and he wanted to see how much he could get away with.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        But Amane knew that if Mahiru caught him acting on his desire, she wouldn't listen to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a word he had to say. He knew without a doubt that this would all make her incredibly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        uncomfortable, so he stopped short.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to be coming around slowly, but she was obviously not awake just yet.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She hadn't moved, and her cheek was still pressed against Amane's fingers.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had come into the room looking to check on her and maybe grab a change of clothes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        while he was at it. How had he ended up doing something like this? Amane felt his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cheeks grow hot as it fully dawned on him just how unspeakably creepy he was acting.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nn-ngh…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After another moment, Mahiru's eyelids finally started to flutter open again…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Ah."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They locked eyes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's gaze flicked from Amane, who was leaning over her, to his extended finger.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She immediately sat bolt upright.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "M-morning," Amane stammered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…G-good morning…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You fell asleep at my place, so I let you stay the night here, but I didn't have any ulterior<p></p>
        <p></p>
        motives and I swear I didn't do anything, so really, I hope you can appreciate all that…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane said, the words pouring out in a rush as he struggled to explain.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As she listened to Amane's jumbled account, Mahiru stayed quiet, but her cheeks<p></p>
        <p></p>
        quickly flushed bright red as it dawned on her where she had slept, and she tugged at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a corner of the futon, practically hiding herself with it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Finding even that small gesture charming, Amane quickly turned away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        What is happening here?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even though he had lent her a bed for the night, he was starting to feel bad. He knew<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that he had been wrong to touch her without permission. But it had only been for a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        moment, and he had absolutely no intention of taking it any further.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane looked back at Mahiru. His heart was pounding in his chest. He didn't know if<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it was because he was smitten with her or from feeling guilty. He saw that her cheeks<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were still tinged red, and she was staring at him with a sullen look… or not quite sullen.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It seemed like she had something to say to him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Amane, do you like touching my cheeks?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, you touched me at Christmas and then again yesterday when I fell asleep,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        didn't you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…So you were awake the whole time?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The other night, when he had stroked her cheek… he'd thought that she'd been fast<p></p>
        <p></p>
        asleep. That she would never know he'd touched her. But she did, because she'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        actually been awake at the time.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, you see, I briefly woke up just as I was being lowered into bed… Moreover, how<p></p>
        <p></p>
        could I do anything else in a situation like that?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Weren't you worried about me… doing something?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I never thought you would do anything like that, but… in order to confirm my<p></p>
        <p></p>
        suspicions, I pretended to be asleep."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, falling asleep in front of him had been some kind of test to determine<p></p>
        <p></p>
        whether he was really worthy of her trust. Ultimately, it seemed like she was leaning<p></p>
        <p></p>
        toward yes rather than no, for which he was glad.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane hoped she wouldn't test that out again. He really wasn't sure he would do any<p></p>
        <p></p>
        better the next time he was faced with controlling himself when she was that same<p></p>
        <p></p>
        charming vulnerability, either.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Well, I'm glad you haven't decided I'm totally shady. Also please don't try any more<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tests. I am a man, after all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh, I kn-know that, but—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Or maybe you were expecting me to try something?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Of course not!" Mahiru firmly denied, pulling the comforter back up around her. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was practically shaking, and Amane thought he'd seen her start to blush, just a little.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He wisely swallowed the urge to make a joke about her being in his bed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        For now, it was probably a good idea to give Mahiru some space until she regained her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        composure.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After that inexplicable bout of awkwardness, Mahiru returned to her apartment to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        freshen up before coming back again. But it was obvious that she was still embarrassed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        because she refused to make eye contact with Amane. Every time he tried to catch her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gaze, she turned away. Even though she was sitting on the sofa right next to him, it was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like she was miles away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Please forgive me," Amane said, stomach twisting in knots.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru quickly glanced over at him, then sighed softly. Maybe she wasn't as upset<p></p>
        <p></p>
        anymore; she was wearing her usual serene expression. "I'm not angry. You don't have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to apologize, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I think—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I suppose I'm mostly upset with myself for being so careless, that's all. I really wish<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you hadn't seen me like that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Like… what? I thought you looked really sweet…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's dreaming face had reminded him why people called her an angel, but more<p></p>
        <p></p>
        importantly, he had discovered that just after she woke up, in the moments between<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sleep and wakefulness, her usual cool and collected demeanor gave way to a youthful<p></p>
        <p></p>
        innocence that he found extremely charming.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If anything, Amane wanted to see her like that again.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        But it was clear that Mahiru was not happy that he'd seen her with her guard down.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Before Amane could argue any further, she bit her lip hard and suddenly whacked him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with a pillow. It didn't hurt or anything—it was obvious that Mahiru wasn't really<p></p>
        <p></p>
        trying—but it caught Amane by surprise.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What the heck?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You know, I hate that about you, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hate what? At least tell me what I did wrong."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What you said… That's not the sort of thing that you can just say to a girl so casually,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you know?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well it's not like I would say that sort of thing to anyone else…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The only girls Amane knew were Mahiru and Chitose. And sure, Chitose was cute, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane found her more annoying than anything else, and there was no need for him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to praise her to her face anyway. So who else would he even talk to like that?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could see that Mahiru was feeling defensive. He watched her reactions carefully<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as he continued. "Besides, you must be used to people saying those kinds of things<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about you, right?" He shrugged. "Why should it bother you now?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After all, he had told Mahiru many times that he thought she was cute. It didn't seem<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like the kind of thing that would suddenly become a sticking point. She knew how<p></p>
        <p></p>
        beautiful she was.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She can't be that embarrassed just because of a little compliment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That's what Amane thought, but for some reason, Mahiru was still wearing a sour face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Seriously, what's the matter?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…It's nothing."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She landed one final attack by whacking him again with the cushion, then Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        turned away sharply and said "I'm going to go make mochi soup" before putting on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her apron and heading for the kitchen.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane couldn't do anything but squeeze the cushion and stare at Mahiru's back as she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        abruptly stalked out of the room.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        By the time they finished eating the mochi soup, Mahiru was back to her usual self.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The start of the meal had been rather uncomfortable, but both the soup and the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        assorted osechi dishes were so delicious that Amane had quickly forgotten everything<p></p>
        <p></p>
        else, and before he realized it, Mahiru's spirits had recovered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As they moved from the table back to sitting together on the sofa, Amane asked, "By<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the way, are you planning to go for a shrine visit to start off the New Year, Mahiru?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shrine visit? I wasn't really planning to go… I don't like crowds, you know. People<p></p>
        <p></p>
        always stare at me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's because you're…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had been about to say "…because you're so beautiful," but the mood had only just<p></p>
        <p></p>
        recovered after his earlier faux pas, so he swallowed the words and only said "Well, I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        guess there's not a ton you can do about that" instead.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Are you going to go to one, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I always went with my parents when I was back home, but I was just wondering<p></p>
        <p></p>
        whether I should go. I was thinking that it might be best to pass, at least on New Year's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Day."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Agreed."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Chitose and Itsuki are having a cozy time at her place, so they're not around, and kids<p></p>
        <p></p>
        these days don't make a big deal out of the first shrine visit of the year anyway, you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        know? I think we can put it off."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Compared to the old days… for young people, especially those in their teens and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        twenties, first-day-of-the-year shrine visits were getting less and less popular. Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and Mahiru wouldn't be especially strange for skipping out.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It wasn't exactly that he didn't want to go, but he knew that there would be too many<p></p>
        <p></p>
        people to be able to move comfortably and that the experience would just end up<p></p>
        <p></p>
        being exhausting, so he was thinking it would probably be better to go after the crowds<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thinned out a bit.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Besides," Amane continued, "I want to spend the first three days of the New Year<p></p>
        <p></p>
        relaxing. I don't really care about holiday bargains or anything, either."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Actually, I am sort of interested in the special blind bags some stores have," Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mentioned.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Are you going to a shopping mall or somewhere?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She shook her head. "…I'm not brave enough to charge into those crowds."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Agreed."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane replied in the same way Mahiru had a moment ago and leaned back into the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sofa.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was definitely no need to go anywhere just because it was New Year's Day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was perfectly content taking it easy at home. He preferred to avoid stressful<p></p>
        <p></p>
        situations, after all. And since they'd be spending the holiday together, he certainly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wouldn't want for food or conversation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Thinking to himself what a luxurious New Year's holiday this was turning out to be,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane stole a glance at Mahiru sitting beside him as a small smile crept onto his face.<p></p>
        <p></p>

        18 : Visiting Parents and the First Shrine Visit of the Year<p></p>
        e stole a glance at Mahiru sitting beside him as a small smile crept onto his face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Can we visit your apartment tomorrow, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's father, Shuuto, sent that message at ten o'clock in the evening on January 3—<p></p>
        <p></p>
        after dinner and after Mahiru had gone home.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's all right that you didn't come home for the holiday, but I do want to see you. Besides,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I heard about her from your mother, but I think I'd better say hello to your neighbor<p></p>
        <p></p>
        myself."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His father probably wanted to meet the person taking such good care of his son. And<p></p>
        <p></p>
        since Amane's mother had already discovered his relationship with Mahiru, and was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        actually in regular contact with her, Amane didn't see much point in refusing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He no longer had anything to hide, and he didn't want to turn his parents away after<p></p>
        <p></p>
        not visiting for the holidays. Plus, Amane figured that the presence of his father should<p></p>
        <p></p>
        help keep his mother in check and prevent her from making a big scene. If nothing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        else, Amane was counting on him to help him avoid a repeat of her last exhausting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        visit.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Besides, Amane had a feeling that even if he did refuse his parents, his mother would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        come over to see Mahiru anyway, so after setting up a time with his father (who had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been courteous enough to ask in advance) Amane sent Mahiru a heads-up message.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Um, well, is it all right for me to be there during your family time? Won't I be intruding?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The next day, Mahiru came over to Amane's apartment early. She seemed nervous.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That was only to be expected, in a way. Mahiru had been taking care of him… though<p></p>
        <p></p>
        phrasing it that way sounded a bit misleading… In any case, Mahiru had been spending<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a lot of time with him, and now his parents wanted to meet her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She was already used to talking with his mother, or at least being talked at by his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mother, but Amane's father would be joining this time. It was no surprise that she was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nervous.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, now that Dad is coming to say hello, and since Mom has taken such a liking to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you, I'd appreciate it if you were here. Really, I need you here."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Y-you say that, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm sure you would rather avoid it, but it'd really mean a lot to me if you'd put up with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it just for a little while."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was somewhat surreal to be introducing her to his parents, but they'd requested,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and now there was no way around it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He felt bad for taking up Mahiru's time, but he knew that his father was the type of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        person who likely wouldn't rest until he'd met her, so he hoped she wouldn't mind it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        too much.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I wonder what Shihoko has told him about me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Relax. I made sure to tell my dad that you are someone who helps me out a lot. Even<p></p>
        <p></p>
        if he gets the wrong idea, I've already told him that my mother's crazy ideas about you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        are not at all true."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's mother seemed to have already decided that Mahiru was his bride-to-be and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her very own future daughter-in-law. Amane had made sure to firmly deny everything<p></p>
        <p></p>
        coming out of her mouth. His father had laughed and said, "Shihoko has always had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the bad habit of letting her imagination run wild." So apparently, he understood the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        situation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru seemed relieved to hear that, and Amane smiled wryly as they waited. "Sorry<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about this."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Then, with perfect timing, the intercom rang.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His parents had already gotten past the lobby with their duplicate key, so he expected<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that they had come directly to his door.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At the sound of the chime, Mahiru shuddered in surprise, so Amane shot her a small<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smile to put her at ease and headed for the door. He took the chain off and unfastened<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the lock.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When he opened the door, there stood his parents, just as he remembered them.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's been half a year, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Long time no see, Dad."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane greeted Shuuto's amicable smile with a slightly relieved grin of his own.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With his gentle demeanor, Shuuto was the type of person who somehow calmed things<p></p>
        <p></p>
        down just by being around. Amane relaxed a little simply seeing him there.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You didn't seem nearly as happy to see your mother…," Shihoko said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's because my mother forced her way in without so much as a warning. If you'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ever give me any notice, I would react normally."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The last time Shihoko had shown up, Mahiru had been at his place, and he'd tried to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        turn her away. If he'd been alone, he probably would have treated her a little nicer.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well anyway, come on in," Amane added. "What's with the package?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, we brought you all sorts of things. But we can look at that later. Where's Mahiru?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Inside," Amane answered succinctly. After his parents had removed their shoes, he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        led them into the living room.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru seemed anxious as she looked over at them and blinked, wide-eyed, in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        understandable surprise.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's father looked remarkably young. He didn't seem to be much past thirty,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        especially if you forgot that he had a teenage son, and had a youthful, handsome face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        More than once, Amane had wished that he took more after his father, whose tender<p></p>
        <p></p>
        features made him seem like a well-mannered young man (though in actuality, he was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        middle-aged). When the two of them walked side by side, they looked more like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        distant brothers than father and son.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru dear, it's been too long," Shihoko said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "'Too long'? It's only been a month!" Amane remarked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I think that counts." Shihoko approached Mahiru wearing a beaming smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru stood straighter and greeted her with a formal "How good to see you again,"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wearing the faint smile that was an integral part of her public persona.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        But her bewildered eyes were still straying toward Amane's father, standing next to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shihoko. Shuuto smiled warmly when he noticed Mahiru looking.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nice to meet you. I'm Amane's father, Shuuto Fujimiya. I've heard about you from<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shihoko, Miss Shiina. Thank you for taking such good care of our son."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nice to meet you. I'm Mahiru Shiina. And I appreciate everything Amane does for me<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as well."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shuuto bowed politely, and Mahiru introduced herself courteously.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had probably been worried that Amane's father would be a lot like his mother,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but Shuuto was a mild-mannered man with a good head on his shoulders, and he was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        doing his best to put Mahiru at ease.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shuuto was generally the one who reined in Shihoko's wilder tendencies. Really, he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was the only person she would listen to, which proved just how much she loved him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Goodness, you don't have to be so modest!" Shihoko interrupted. "Amane is a slob,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        after all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Geez, sorry I don't meet your standards…," Amane muttered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come now, Shihoko, don't say things like that," his father said. "…And, Amane, this girl<p></p>
        <p></p>
        is taking care of you day in, day out, so I'm sure you're showing her the appropriate<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gratitude and appreciation, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "As best I can."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's what I like to hear."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shuuto, who had raised Amane to treasure women, had apparently been worried over<p></p>
        <p></p>
        whether his son was being considerate enough. Of course Amane would have found it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        unbearable to kick back while Mahiru did everything, so he did whatever he could for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shuuto seemed reassured by Amane's answer and turned his gaze toward Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        again.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Truly, I must offer you my thanks. I hear you've been fixing my son's meals every<p></p>
        <p></p>
        day, and you were even kind enough to make osechi dishes for the holiday…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm always thanking her for that. I've been trying to show my appreciation every<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chance I get, too."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's true…" Mahiru nodded. "Amane's surprisingly considerate."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Surprisingly?" Amane asked. "And what's so surprising about it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Th-that is, I—I mean…," Mahiru stammered. "You seemed… a bit neglectful at first<p></p>
        <p></p>
        glance, but it turns out you actually pay rather close attention."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane found himself at a loss for words, unable to refute anything she said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "The most important thing is that the two of you are getting along well," Shuuto said<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with a gentle smile. "Amane, make sure you're not being too much of a bother to Miss<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shiina."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I know that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And, Miss Shiina, I'd like you to speak up right away if Amane gives you any trouble.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        My son might not seem like it, but he's really quite an earnest young man, so I believe<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he'll do his best to smooth over any… rough patches."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane is a nice guy. I can't think of anything rough about him… well, maybe just a tiny<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bit…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "He's not exactly the smoothest, eh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No… he's not really disagreeable… more like, he's just a little hopeless."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was fidgeting as if she was having a hard time saying what was on her mind. It<p></p>
        <p></p>
        made Amane want to cross-examine her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        What exactly is so hopeless that you had to say it like that?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        For some reason that Amane didn't understand, Shihoko seemed to grasp what<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru getting at. She looked over at him with a broad grin. "Ah-haah!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane couldn't do much more than glare at his mother in irritation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Here you are."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's parents were guests in his apartment, so it was only natural to treat them as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        such. However, Mahiru had insisted on being the one to set out the tea, so Amane had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        left it in her capable hands.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had brought her tea set over to his apartment so she could use it whenever<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she visited. Amane had never imagined it would be used for this, though.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Both of his parents were wearing warm smiles, seated on the sofa where Amane and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru usually sat together.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "My goodness, thank you, Mahiru dear. You're quite skilled at hosting visitors, aren't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Y-yes."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Though, really, that should be Amane's job, you know?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was doing it because when Amane tried brewing tea, it usually turned out<p></p>
        <p></p>
        much too bitter.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Still, Shihoko looked somewhat aghast.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, I wanted to do it, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I suppose that's fine, since Amane never gets the water temperature right."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His mother was absolutely correct, but it made him a little irritated that she pointed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it out so blatantly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        However, he couldn't deny the truth, so he stoically kept his mouth shut as Shihoko<p></p>
        <p></p>
        turned to him and smiled.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come to think of it, Amane, you've finally started calling sweetie Mahiru by her first<p></p>
        <p></p>
        name, haven't you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At this sudden observation, both Amane and Mahiru froze.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They had grown so comfortable talking to each other that they hadn't noticed, but last<p></p>
        <p></p>
        time they had seen Amane's mother, the two of them had still been addressing each<p></p>
        <p></p>
        other quite formally.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…What's it matter?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I think it's great!" His mother beamed. "It's nice that you're getting more intimate."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Without pressing the issue any further, Shihoko just sat and beamed at them.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could feel his cheek begin to twitch. He almost wished she would just make<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fun of him. It would have been easier than dealing with his mother's wild assumptions<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and fabricated narratives.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shihoko dear, don't tease Amane so much," Amane's father interjected. "It's a bad<p></p>
        <p></p>
        habit of yours," he added.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, honey. You know I just can't help myself." Amane's mother capitulated to his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        father without much resistance, a fact for which their long-suffering son was acutely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        grateful. "But it's wonderful, isn't it? To see our son getting on so well with a cute girl?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm more concerned about whether you might get carried away again, Shihoko darling."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "When that happens, you'll step in for me, won't you, Shuuto darling?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "On some level, I wish you'd work on it if you're already aware it's an issue… but that's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        also part of what makes you the woman I fell in love with, so I suppose there's no<p></p>
        <p></p>
        helping it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ho-ho… what a sly fox you are."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even though he was glad Shihoko had eased up on him, Amane couldn't help but sigh<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as his parents drifted off into their own little world.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His father was fundamentally a sensible man, but he had the unfortunate habit of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        doting on his treasured wife, which sometimes made it a little awkward for anyone<p></p>
        <p></p>
        else stuck in the same room.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Fortunately, they only did this in front of family and didn't act so embarrassingly in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        public. On the other hand, this was supposed to be Amane's apartment, and he wished<p></p>
        <p></p>
        they would show a little more restraint. He was glad that his parents still had a strong<p></p>
        <p></p>
        relationship after so many years together, but they could have been more considerate<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about their public displays of affection.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Whenever they got like this, Amane didn't like to force himself in between them, so he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        simply sat down in the chair he had brought over from the dining room and sighed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        deeply again in resignation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru also took a seat in the chair he had set up next to his, and asked Amane quietly,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Your parents get along very well, don't they?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sure do. I mean, they're not like that outside, but that's definitely how they are at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        home."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I see," Mahiru answered with a peculiar smile, then looked over at Shihoko and Shuuto.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She didn't seem uncomfortable at all—just the opposite, in fact. Mahiru looked like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she was staring at something dazzling and priceless. Amane thought he saw a touch<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of envy in her gaze as she smiled so faintly that the word fleeting didn't do it justice.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Without thinking, Amane extended a hand toward hers—<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, Amane, what is it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He immediately withdrew his hand as the sound of Shihoko's voice pulled him back to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his senses.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't ask me. You and Dad went off into your own world. The two of us could barely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stand to look at you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, are you jealous?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Not a chance. I was just thinking that you should get a room. In the privacy of your<p></p>
        <p></p>
        own home, preferably."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His mother didn't seem to have noticed that he had been on the verge of grabbing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's hand. Mahiru also seemed not to have noticed and forced a smile at Amane's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        words.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He didn't understand why he had instinctually reached out toward her. For some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        reason… he had felt like he couldn't bear the thought of leaving Mahiru all alone.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She was already back to her usual self, so Amane felt slightly relieved and put on his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        usual surly expression so that no one would be any the wiser.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So are you satisfied now, having seen your son's face?" Amane demanded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm more satisfied seeing sweet Mahiru than you, Amane…" His mother leered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm only joking. We still haven't accomplished our real mission yet, you know."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Your real what now…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had assumed that they had come over to simply exchange New Year's greetings<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and meet Mahiru, but his mother seemed to have some other goal in mind.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You and Mahiru haven't been on your first shrine visit of the year yet, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "We were planning to go after the crowds die down."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I knew it! And you haven't been yet, either, right, Mahiru? I asked in my message."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Right." Mahiru nodded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I thought that would be the case, so we brought kimonos!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, his mother wanted to go on a shrine visit with Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shihoko was wearing a wide grin as Amane finally realized the reason why she had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        brought such a large bag with her. He sighed again. He'd lost count of how many times<p></p>
        <p></p>
        today.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shihoko loved cute things, and she loved playing dress-up, so she'd probably been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        waiting for a chance like this.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane also recalled that his mother had a large number of kimonos at home.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, she had brought some with her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I've always dreamed of putting a kimono on a daughter and going on a shrine visit<p></p>
        <p></p>
        together… Oh, I'm sure this one will suit you, Mahiru."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mom, you just want a dress-up doll."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's not true! But I really do want to dress up Mahiru. Look, this one would suit her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so well!" Shihoko was full of confidence, and her opinion was correct, insofar as there<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were hardly any clothes that wouldn't suit Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had seen her in everything from boyish outfits to fancy getups on top of her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        usual girly outfits that featured plenty of frills and lace. As far as he could remember,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        each and every style seemed to suit Mahiru just fine. Apparently, beautiful people<p></p>
        <p></p>
        didn't need to be choosy about what they wore. It was not hard to imagine that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        traditional Japanese clothes would really suit her as well.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was an only child, so his mother was obviously not going to pass up this chance<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to dress up the daughter of her dreams.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Well, if Mahiru says it's all right, how about you dress her up and go?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Why are you talking like you're not coming, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I can't; it'll be trouble if I go out with Mahiru and people from school see us together."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If it was only his parents and Mahiru, they would just look like any other family going<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on a shrine visit, so it wouldn't rouse any suspicions, but if Amane joined them, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        someone from their class spotted him at the shrine with Mahiru, well, he imagined<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that the start of the winter semester would turn into something out of a nightmare.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        No shrine visit was worth that risk.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So it'll be all right as long as no one finds out?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I suppose, but I'm pretty sure it'd be really… Uh, wait. I don't like where this is going,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mom…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Heh-heh! I came prepared for situations just like this!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What situations?!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had thought that she'd brought an awful lot of luggage for only kimonos and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        underclothes and accessories. Apparently, she had brought even more stuff so she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        could play dress-up with Amane as well.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Your father is also very excited, you know."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Dad…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "We don't get to go out together very often," Amane's father said, "and it is our family's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tradition, after all, so I'd like us to all go together."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When he put it that way, it was difficult to refuse.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's father cared a great deal about family traditions. He would feel bad for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        refusing to go along after both his parents made it clear how much they wanted it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But look—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's fine, dear. You just let your mother take care of it. I'll make you look like a stylish<p></p>
        <p></p>
        young man. I promise you won't even resemble the old Amane!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Isn't that basically the same as saying I'm not stylish now?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Of course, you've got good features because you take after your father, but your<p></p>
        <p></p>
        haircut and clothes are so unfashionable. I'd say you look gloomy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I didn't ask."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was painfully aware of his drab appearance, but he looked like this because he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        liked to, so he didn't appreciate the criticism.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You'd think that someone so handsome would have an easy time looking cool, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you're a troublesome case, Amane…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's none of your business."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's such a waste… right, Mahiru dear? Wouldn't you like to see Amane all tidied up?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As the conversation suddenly shifted to her, Mahiru became visibly flustered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wished that his mother wouldn't prod at Mahiru so aggressively, but she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        continued needling the poor girl.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Once Amane is all dressed up, I think you'll see him in a whole new light, too, Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He may not look it, but Amane's got a fairly handsome face, you know?
        <p></p>
        Personality wise, he's got some work to do, but he does resemble Shuuto, and he knows how to be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a gentleman, so if you train him well, I think he could turn out quite nice."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, um… I… suppose so…?" Mahiru stammered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And don't you want to go on the first shrine visit of the year together?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "W-well I… um… I do want to go, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, how could you double-cross me like that?" Amane whined.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He'd been counting on her to consider what might happen in the worst-case scenario<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and reject his parents' proposal.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru glanced at the beleaguered Amane. "…If Amane doesn't want to, it's fine," she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        said in a quiet, slightly discouraged voice, frowning.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane choked. She was trying to hide it, but he could tell that Mahiru was disappointed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It wasn't anything dramatic; just a subtle change in her expression. Looking at her long<p></p>
        <p></p>
        eyelashes fluttering over her downcast eyes, Amane felt a powerful knot of guilt<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tighten in his chest.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His mother shot him a look of condemnation, as if to say You made sweet Mahiru sad!<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and his father wore an expression that said It would be easier to fold here.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane groaned quietly and simply said, "…All right."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Mahiru made a face like that, there was nothing to do but give in.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Okay, you're all set."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shihoko had been tinkering wildly with Amane's hair and clothes, until he was quite<p></p>
        <p></p>
        exhausted by the time he was finally set free.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It had been pure agony for him, who wasn't much interested in clothes, but when he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        checked himself in the mirror, he could see that his suffering had been worth it. Staring<p></p>
        <p></p>
        back at him was a handsome young man, completely unlike the usual Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The outfit Shihoko had chosen for him was a dark-gray Chesterfield coat over a white<p></p>
        <p></p>
        turtleneck, paired with black slacks—clean and casual.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Since this was supposed to be an auspicious New Year's event, she had apparently<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thought it was critical that he dress up a little. Amane usually didn't like especially<p></p>
        <p></p>
        colorful clothing, so this subdued, monochrome arrangement pleased him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He checked his hairstyle, too, and saw that his mother's skill with a flat iron and some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        styling wax had really worked wonders with his long bangs. His eyes had emerged<p></p>
        <p></p>
        from their usual hiding spot behind his hair, and the impression he gave off was much<p></p>
        <p></p>
        brighter now that you could actually see his whole face. The extra volume in his hair<p></p>
        <p></p>
        plus the excellent styling made him look more dignified and refined as well.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The person in the mirror wasn't the Amane who got teased by his mother and Itsuki<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for being gloomy, but a bright young man who Amane had never seen before.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You can turn into such a good-looking young man with just a little work, so I wonder<p></p>
        <p></p>
        why you don't do it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Because I don't want to."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You can really be such a grouch sometimes. Your face is usually dour, so unless you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smile, you won't look good, you know?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Being called dour stung, but Amane couldn't argue with the facts.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, I'm going to go put the finishing touches on Mahiru, so you go wait in the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        living room."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had been busy in his room, so he didn't have any idea how Mahiru was getting<p></p>
