        on. She had gone back to her apartment to dress herself, presumably to quite a high<p></p>
        <p></p>
        standard.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He watched his mother leave the room, then looked himself over in the mirror again.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He hadn't gotten dressed up like this in a long time, so he didn't resemble himself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Well, I guess it's not bad."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was sure he'd still look shabby standing next to Mahiru, but this was a big<p></p>
        <p></p>
        improvement.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Playing with his bangs a little, now that they weren't hanging in front of his eyes,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane muttered under his breath that sprucing himself up like this from time to time<p></p>
        <p></p>
        probably wouldn't be a bad thing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After waiting in the living room with his father for the better part of an hour, Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        heard the front door open.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had heard that women's preparations could take quite a lot of time and effort, so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he hadn't been particularly unhappy with the wait itself, but he was still a bit worried<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about leaving Mahiru alone and whether his mother might have crossed any lines.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Finally, thought Amane as he stood up from the sofa and looked toward the entryway,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        just as Mahiru quietly arrived in the living room.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The moment he laid eyes on her, he was stunned.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru didn't normally wear traditional Japanese clothing, so he had never had the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chance to see her in it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had thought for sure that a kimono would look good on her, but—he hadn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expected this.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        According to his mother, it would be difficult to move through a crowd in a long-sleeved
        <p></p>
        kimono, so she had chosen something shorter. With its light-pink color and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        small, repeating pattern of plum blossoms, the kimono suited Mahiru so well that it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was hard to believe it didn't actually belong to her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru didn't normally wear much pink, but it gave her an air of refinement and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        femininity.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her light-colored hair had been left out in long bangs on the sides, and the rest had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been gathered into a bun and decorated with a kanzashi hair clip. Swaying across the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pure-white nape of her neck, the accessory accentuated the girlishness of the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ensemble and gave her a distinctly feminine allure.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The elegant outfit, coupled with makeup that had been judiciously applied to enhance<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her natural good looks, elevated Mahiru to the pinnacle of grace and beauty.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So?" Amane's mother beamed. "I think we made her look very cute. Sweet Mahiru is<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so lovely to begin with, and dolling her up really had quite the effect."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yes, it certainly suits her, dear," his father quickly agreed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had her eyes cast downward, looking rather embarrassed by all the praise.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even that movement had something alluring about it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Beauty can really be terrifying.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come on, Amane, say something."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I think it looks good."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was obviously no way he could possibly say what he really thought, especially<p></p>
        <p></p>
        not right there in front of his parents, so Amane kept his praise safely subdued.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His mother looked extremely dissatisfied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…That won't do at all!" she insisted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, be quiet." Amane turned away. He was not going to engage with his mother any<p></p>
        <p></p>
        further.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shihoko gave an exasperated sigh at her son's behavior, but perhaps because she knew<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him quite well, she seemed to agree to let it go.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Good grief. Anyway, Mahiru darling, what do you think? Amane looks like a whole<p></p>
        <p></p>
        new person, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Y-yes. This is completely different…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And to think even though he would be so popular if he put in the effort to look like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        this all the time, he doesn't ever bother. Really, he's only harming himself."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane thought this was none of her business, but his mother sighed heavily again, as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        if she truly regretted the loss of potential.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm so disappointed in Amane—he has the good fortune to take after his father, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        yet he doesn't even try to put it to good use. What a waste!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come now, Shihoko," his father said gently. "Amane's growing up in his own way."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If he's growing up, then shouldn't he want to be popular?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If I had to guess, I'd say Amane is the type who is perfectly fine spending time with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        just one other person rather than bothering with a crowd."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I guess."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's father had tried to stall Shihoko, but that only fueled her wildest delusions.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was true Amane preferred to hang out one-on-one rather than tag along in a big<p></p>
        <p></p>
        group… Apparently, that was something he had gotten from his father, and he really<p></p>
        <p></p>
        did think it was best, but if he said as much, especially now, it would sound like he was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        saying the person he preferred most was Mahiru…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His mother's radiant smile turned into a grimace, and she turned away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wondered why he had to put up with her unfair cynicism, but as a practical<p></p>
        <p></p>
        matter, he was well aware that other people looked at him the same way.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At the very least, Amane could say that Mahiru was a special case. That was the truth,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but—<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He snuck a glance at Mahiru, quickly, so she wouldn't notice, and sighed softly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I guess I do like her, in a sense, he thought. I mean, what's not to like about her?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        However, that was quite a different matter than declaring feelings of love.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mom, there is absolutely nothing going on, I'm telling you. So how about you stop it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with the crazy accusations and go get the car ready."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What an ungrateful child you are… really! Well, all right, I suppose. Shuuto, let's go<p></p>
        <p></p>
        prepare the car, shall we?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sounds like a plan."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had apparently succeeded in changing the subject, as both parents left to make<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ready for their departure.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was leaving it up to his parents to decide which shrine they were going to, and he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        watched their backs as they left his apartment to head for the parking lot.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I've got the essentials in my bag, so I don't need much getting ready. How about you,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Everything I need is in this handbag, so I'm ready, too."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Gotcha."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They were suddenly alone again, so with a slightly anxious feeling, Amane locked up<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the windows and unplugged nonessential appliances from the walls.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Once he had turned off the living room lights, he looked at Mahiru again.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As always, it was immediately apparent she was a beauty. He doubted whether there<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was another girl in the world who looked as good in a kimono.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He hadn't been comfortable praising her in front of his parents, but Amane was sure<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that anyone who saw her would agree that Mahiru was particularly beautiful in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        traditional Japanese dress.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is something the matter, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, no, I was just thinking it really suits you. You look like an old-fashioned beauty<p></p>
        <p></p>
        from a painting or something. The outfit's cute, and I think you're really lovely."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had learned from his father that when a girl was smartly dressed, compliments<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were in order, so he knew he should have praised her look the moment he saw her, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he had been too embarrassed to do it in front of his parents.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Once Amane had voiced his honest appraisal, Mahiru dramatically blinked several<p></p>
        <p></p>
        times, then blushed and pursed her lips tightly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Recalling the last time she had reacted like that, Amane smiled bitterly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, you don't like being complimented, right? Sorry."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Th-that's not it, but… Amane, you're fairly—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Fairly what?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…It's nothing."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She abruptly turned away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wondered what was going on with her, but she didn't look like she was going<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to elaborate, so Amane quietly finished closing up the apartment and accompanied<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru to the door.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She seemed to have given some thought to the fact that they'd be walking around,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        because she was wearing boots instead of the traditional sandals. Her choice of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        footwear blended Japanese and western elements in her outfit, and she looked all the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        more adorable for it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru somehow wiggled into her boots, as her hair accessory swung back and forth<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with a rustling sound, and Amane, who had gone out first to hold the door, found<p></p>
        <p></p>
        himself suddenly quite close to her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru caught him by surprise when she stood up on her tiptoes and gingerly leaned<p></p>
        <p></p>
        even closer to him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Thinking that maybe she wanted to tell him something, Amane shut the door and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        locked it, then bent over to lend her his ear. Mahiru cupped her palms around her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mouth and whispered into his ear.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Um… You look good, too, you know?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That was all she said before slipping past him and briskly heading for the elevator.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane promptly banged his head against his front door.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…That's not fair."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's heart was pounding like an alarm going off in his chest, his face was burning,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and his forehead hurt. Mahiru had set him ablaze in a single breath. This was her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        revenge.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His parents looked at him suspiciously as he hustled to catch up to them in the parking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        lot.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When they arrived at a famous shrine located in an area a little less than an hour away,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        there weren't as many people as they had seen on television, but the crowds still<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seemed practically endless.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, it's thinned out quite a bit, but I'd say there are still plenty here, eh?" Amane's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mother remarked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "There sure are…," Amane agreed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru darling, careful not to stray. We'll keep an eye on you, too, and we all have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smartphones, so I think finding one another would be easy enough. But even so, I want<p></p>
        <p></p>
        us all to visit the shrine together, of course."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Okay."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Dressed in a kimono, Mahiru had the hardest time moving out of all of them. The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        restrictive garment forced her to take small steps and walk slowly. At least she was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wearing boots instead of sandals.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They didn't necessarily have to push their way through the crowd, but it was tight<p></p>
        <p></p>
        enough that it was easy to run into people, so they had to proceed with caution.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, shall we get going?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shihoko was leading the way through the crowd, and she headed first for the ablution<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pavilion where they would purify their hands and mouths with water. As expected,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was already attracting attention from many people.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        More than a few people were dressed in kimonos, so Mahiru didn't stand out much for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wearing one… but that wasn't the issue.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She drew people's eyes even in her school uniform, when she wasn't dressed up at all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Now that she looked like an aristocratic beauty in traditional Japanese clothing, she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        obviously garnered a lot of attention. Even her motions as she cleaned her mouth were<p></p>
        <p></p>
        graceful. Practically everyone in the shrine was staring.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Is something the matter?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, nothing."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Though Amane was thinking it was all rather interesting, he didn't say as much, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he cleansed his hands and mouth just as his parents had, then followed after them as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        they walked on ahead.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was doing his best to match pace with Mahiru, but as expected for someone who<p></p>
        <p></p>
        didn't ordinarily wear Japanese clothes, the long hem was giving her some difficulty,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and the shrine was still quite crowded, so she was progressing much more slowly than<p></p>
        <p></p>
        usual.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru, are you all right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yes, this is… Aaah!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She was getting bumped around by the other shrine-goers, which kept knocking her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        off-balance and threatened to topple her outright, so Amane extended an arm to assist.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You don't seem to be all right."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Of course she was uncomfortable walking around in a strange and complicated getup.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Sorry."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Here, give me your hand."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane reached for one small hand that was peeking out of her kimono sleeve. Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looked up at him, and he nearly pulled his hand back, but she quickly pressed her palm<p></p>
        <p></p>
        into his, keeping her eyes on him the whole time. He stared right back at her, though<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he was not entirely sure why.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru squeezed Amane's hand tightly and looked away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He tilted his head questioningly, and they followed the flow of the crowd for a moment,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        until they were about to arrive in front of the offertory box, so Amane tucked whatever<p></p>
        <p></p>
        small doubts he had away in his heart and focused on the sensation of her hand in his.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You were praying for a really long time; what did you ask for?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Once they had finished their visit and moved a distance away from the file of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        worshippers, he posed this question to Mahiru, who had prayed at some length. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had looked like a model going through all the motions of a shrine visit. After ringing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the bell, she had pressed her hands together for nearly twice as long as Amane. He had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been captivated by how elegantly she had offered her prayers, but he also wondered<p></p>
        <p></p>
        what she had to pray for.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Good health."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "An incredibly safe choice."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was very typical of Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She didn't want for very much, so Amane had wondered what she might have asked<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for, but it was so predictable choice that her answer was kind of anticlimactic.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That, and—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…And to be able to keep spending peaceful days together, just like we have been."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Another very typical petition.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was just the sort of thing that Mahiru, who didn't much care for excitement or<p></p>
        <p></p>
        change, would pray for. It was very fitting, as she prized peace and quiet.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "We won't get much of that while my mom's around, though."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's something we can enjoy for what it is."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Is it, though…?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wasn't sure, but Mahiru seemed to be enjoying herself, so he didn't argue and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        just took Mahiru's hand with a gentle smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They hadn't yet entirely extracted themselves from the crowd, and Amane was sure to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        find himself in trouble if he let Mahiru trip and fall now. He could see his parents<p></p>
        <p></p>
        waiting a short distance away, having already finished their own visit to the shrine.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That was why Amane was holding her hand, he told himself. Mahiru's eyelashes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fluttered, and she kept her eyes cast downward, looking embarrassed, but she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        squeezed Amane's hand back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You two, over here!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His mother's voice was bright and clear, easy to distinguish among the crowd.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Following her words, the two of them headed over to Amane's parents. Shihoko's eyes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        went wide when she saw them, then she pressed a hand over her smiling mouth.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh my, my!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're just holding hands so naturally."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It wasn't until she spelled it out that he realized what a mistake it was to hold Mahiru's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hand in front of his mother. This was the kind of thing that couples did, wasn't it? He<p></p>
        <p></p>
        didn't appreciate Shihoko's suspicions and hated always being on the receiving end of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her smirking grins.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…It's obviously so we don't lose sight of each other. Plus, it's easy for her to trip,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wearing a kimono."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "He's right. It's difficult to walk in a kimono, and he's doing the right thing by escorting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her. I do the same thing for you, Shihoko dear," Amane's father agreed. In a single<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smooth motion, he grasped his wife's hand.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's life would be easier if he were able to take a girl's hand as smoothly as his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        father could, but he knew it was impossible given his personality, so he was secretly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        grateful that Mahiru had been frank about taking his hand instead.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Feeling relieved that his mother's attention was occupied, Amane tried to gently let go<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of Mahiru's hand, but she wouldn't relax her grip.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He could tell from the way she squeezed that she had no intention of separating, so he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        quietly asked her what was wrong, but there was no answer. Her delicate fingers<p></p>
        <p></p>
        simply held tightly to his.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru, Mahiru sweetie, we were thinking of going to buy some hot drinks. Would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you like sweet red bean soup—or sweet sake?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, I'll take red bean soup, please."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His mother's interruption spoiled any hope of asking Mahiru further questions or of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        getting his hand back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How about you, Amane dear?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…All right, I'll have sweet sake."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Coming right up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As long as Mahiru doesn't hate this, I guess it's fine, right?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane tried to calm the fluttering in his chest as he adjusted his hand in hers.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Before long, Shihoko returned from the concessions stand and handed everyone their<p></p>
        <p></p>
        drinks. At this point, it would have been incredibly awkward for them to continue<p></p>
        <p></p>
        holding hands, so Mahiru let go, and Amane got the chance to catch his breath.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His parents were smiling at each other gently as they enjoyed their sweet sake.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They weren't quite off in their own world, but they were getting flirty, so Amane had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        no desire to speak to them at the moment and instead focused on drinking his own<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sweet sake.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Sweet sake like this was said to be so nutritious it was like having an IV drip, and as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the rich sweetness of the fermented rice spread through him, he unintentionally let<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out a sigh that was a mix of astonishment and relief.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane didn't usually care much for sweets, though he did rather like red bean paste,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so he had also been tempted to choose the red bean soup. However, he had gone with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the sake because it felt more appropriate for New Year's, and he was confident that it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had been the right choice.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When he glanced over at Mahiru, he saw her sipping her sweet red bean soup from a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        paper cup with a calm expression. She made it look absolutely delicious, and suddenly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he regretted his decision.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I wonder if I can get her to give me a sip?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was gazing at her and wondering if he could get some if he asked, when Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        noticed him looking and tilted her head quizzically. Her hair decoration swayed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        rhythmically with her graceful movements.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is the sweet red bean soup any good?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's delicious," she said, nodding.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Could I try some?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru looked startled by his question. It was almost comical how quickly she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        straightened up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, s-sure you can, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She couldn't hide how flustered she was, glancing up at him timidly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If you don't want me to, it's fine…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's… it's not that I don't want you to, but… well—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "N-no, nothing, it's fine. Here. Could I have some of your sake, too?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "S-sure."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru quickly seized his cup. She seemed suddenly very agitated for some reason.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane accepted her cup of red bean soup.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In it was a thick liquid that was certainly bean-colored.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When he brought the cup to his lips, the unique fragrance of sweet red beans wafted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gently over him and filled his nose as a rich flavor spread over his tongue. Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        didn't have much of a sweet tooth, so even the slight sweetness of the bean soup<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seemed strong to him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was delicious and vividly brought to mind thoughts of how well sweet red bean<p></p>
        <p></p>
        paste paired with bitter green tea.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Since Mahiru seemed to have a thing for sweets, he thought this soup was probably<p></p>
        <p></p>
        just perfect for her tastes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When he glanced over at Mahiru, perhaps because she had sipped the sweet sake, her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cheeks were slightly flushed. She looked almost anxious.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You don't like it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's not it… Amane, you made such a big deal out of sharing a piece of cake. Why<p></p>
        <p></p>
        doesn't this bother you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Ah."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That was when he realized why Mahiru had reacted the way she did. Amane froze in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        place.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        We're not feeding each other, but I guess this is still an indirect kiss, huh?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His attention had been focused on the sweet red bean soup, and he had inadvertently<p></p>
        <p></p>
        suggested that they share an indirect kiss. He may not have realized it, but there could<p></p>
        <p></p>
        be no doubt that he had put Mahiru on the spot. That must have been why she had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        acted the way she had.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "S-sorry. That was really thoughtless. I'm sure you hated it…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Wh-why are you always like that, Amane? I was just… I was embarrassed, okay? That<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I— I'll be more careful in the future. Sorry."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Whatever she might have been feeling, it was a fact that he had put her on the spot.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane bowed his head slightly, and Mahiru waved her hand in front of her face<p></p>
        <p></p>
        frantically.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "R-really, I'm not worried about it!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Are you sure? Well, I'm sorry anyway. I shouldn't treat you the same way as my other<p></p>
        <p></p>
        friends."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki and Chitose were the type of people who didn't care about that stuff and would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        take sips of Amane's drinks and bites of his food and insist it was fine because they<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were friends.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki was the same sex as Amane, and Chitose was the opposite sex, but he had never<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looked at either of them with the slightest romantic interest, so it didn't really feel like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        an indirect kiss when they shared food. He just got irritated when they stole his snacks.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        But with Mahiru, it was obviously different. He was in the wrong for not realizing that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sooner.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Do Itsuki and Chitose usually do things like that?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Y-yeah, I mean, we're friends, after all…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is that so?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru nodded, wearing a complex expression that could have been either<p></p>
        <p></p>
        comprehension or consternation. Then she lowered her gaze back down to the sweet<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sake and raised the cup to her lips again.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I suppose, Amane, that you and I are friends, too, so it's fine."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Y-yeah… but you drank it all, didn't you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's cheeks flushed even though there was no alcohol in the drink. "Th-there<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wasn't much left!" She turned away sharply.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In retaliation, Amane gulped down what was left of Mahiru's sweet red bean soup.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He'd expected it to have gotten cold, but it was somehow still hot and seemed even<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sweeter than before.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru dear, you're such a good cook!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        By the time they made it back from the shrine visit, it was already evening. Mahiru had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        changed clothes and begun her usual dinner preparations, but… Amane's mother<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shihoko was also in the kitchen, ostensibly to observe Mahiru's culinary skills.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His parents had decided to spend the night. Their house was several hours away by<p></p>
        <p></p>
        car, and they were tired. It sounded like they had been intending to stay over from the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        outset. Amane wished that they'd asked the guy living there first, but his father<p></p>
        <p></p>
        technically owned the apartment, so he knew he had no right to complain.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Luckily, he had an extra futon set just in case he ever had anyone over, so he figured<p></p>
        <p></p>
        they could share it. They slept in the same bed at home, so it wouldn't be that different.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thank you very much," Mahiru said graciously.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Really, you're very good for a high school girl. When I was your age, there's no way I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        could have done all this."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Your cooking's no match for Mahiru's now, Mom."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Did you say something, dear?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Not a thing."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A low-pitched voice had come flying out of the kitchen at him, so Amane feigned<p></p>
        <p></p>
        innocence and huddled against the sofa. His father was relaxing on the couch next to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him and chided, "Now, Amane, don't pick on your mother."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        But she was always picking on him, so he felt like this was a fair turnabout.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could hear his mother chatting with Mahiru in a cheerful voice.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru calmly kept up with her, unfazed by her intense energy and attention. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seemed to be getting used to the high-strung woman.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Watching from afar, Amane gazed at the two of them preparing dinner and apparently<p></p>
        <p></p>
        getting along well, and he let out a quiet sigh of relief.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Your mother seems to have taken quite a liking to Miss Shiina, hasn't she?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's father was gazing at the two of them in the same way, and he looked pleased.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, she's beautiful and sweet and has a nice personality, so I'm not surprised that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mom likes her."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How about you, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Oh, I mean, I think she's a nice person, and I think she's cute."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I see."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It seemed like a casual question, but Amane's father wasn't the type of person to pry<p></p>
        <p></p>
        too much, so he had probably asked out of genuine curiosity. He didn't press Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on his answer any further.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm looking forward to trying this food that you enjoy every day, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I can vouch for the taste. If Mom doesn't meddle too much, that is."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You don't need to worry. Shihoko was the one who wanted to eat Miss Shiina's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cooking, so I'm sure the most she'll do is help out a little."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's good, if it's true."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His mother wasn't a bad cook, but most of her dishes featured big, bold flavors, in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        contrast to Mahiru's subtle seasonings. Delicate flavors were his father's specialty<p></p>
        <p></p>
        while his mother favored quantity and ease of preparation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Of course, that was important for a housewife who had a growing boy's appetite to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        satisfy, but Amane actually preferred the carefully calibrated flavors of the dishes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru made. He shuddered to think of anyone meddling with Mahiru's exquisite<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seasonings.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Thankfully, his mother seemed to be constraining herself to being Mahiru's assistant<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like his father said, so he breathed a sigh of relief and continued watching the two of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        them cook.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh yes, this is very good," Amane's father said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was no way that the four of them would have fit around Amane's two-person<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dining table, so he had pulled out the large folding desk that had been shut away in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the storage room to use for dinner.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thank you very much." Mahiru looked relieved at Shuuto's frank assessment, and she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        visibly relaxed a little.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, she had never let anyone other than Amane eat her home cooking, outside<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of home-ec class in school, of course, and had been somewhat nervous about it… but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        at last that stiffness melted away once she saw Shuuto's gentle smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's really delicious," Amane's mother added. "If she can cook like this, she won't have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        any trouble living alone—or getting married."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shihoko muttered quietly to herself while looking at Amane. He could feel his cheek<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about to twitch but forcibly maintained a neutral expression and sipped his miso soup.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The rich, dashi-infused flavor was now very familiar to him. He had really gotten used<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to the way Mahiru prepared her dishes and, after eating her cooking every day, had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        practically lost all desire to eat anything else.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane, what do you think?" his mother asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's delicious, of course. Thanks for always cooking, Mahiru."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had been planning to say as much anyway. But now that his mother had prompted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him, it probably sounded like he didn't really mean it. Amane had never forgotten to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tell Mahiru that her cooking was delicious every day when they ate together, but since<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his parents were here, he had been holding back. And that had obviously been the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wrong decision.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His gratitude was no different now, but for some reason, Mahiru was restless, fidgeting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        uncomfortably. "…Sure," she answered in a quiet voice. Her cheeks were flushed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slightly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was probably because his parents were there. There could be no doubt that Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was feeling bashful, even if only a little. She was used to hearing Amane's appraisals<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of her cooking, but now three people had complimented her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're awfully cute, Mahiru."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shihoko, don't tease."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's not what I meant! I was just thinking that she's a good, upstanding girl, which<p></p>
        <p></p>
        is so hard to find these days."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Th-that's… It's not really…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, I can agree with that. Mahiru's like, really pure, you could say."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane?!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was definitely a little naive. Her face had gone bright red once just from seeing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a guy—a not particularly attractive guy—with the front of his shirt open.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "My, my, did something happen between you two while we weren't looking?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nope."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nothing happened."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The denial practically leaped from Mahiru's mouth.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Being innocent or naive wasn't the worst thing in the world, but Mahiru seemed to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hate being called those things. Amane had no plans to say anything further.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I think that they should do just as they please, as long as Amane isn't hurting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Miss Shiina, that is," Amane's father said. "Just don't tease her too much, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I know that much."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Well, weren't you just teasing her?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, it was an accurate description—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane felt something strike his thigh below the table. Mahiru's face was bright red,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and she was glaring in his direction.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry, sorry," he said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A sullen expression crossed her handsome features. But that only made her look even<p></p>
        <p></p>
        more adorable, and Amane couldn't help but grin. He only hoped that Mahiru wouldn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stay mad at him for long.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You know, I can't help but feel a bit like we're looking in the mirror. What do you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        think, Shihoko darling?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I think that's just fine, Shuuto dear. Why, even our Amane is wearing an<p></p>
        <p></p>
        uncharacteristically gentle expression."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What are you guys talking about over there?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Not a thing, dear!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could have sworn that he heard some low, conspiratorial whispers from across<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the table, but his parents maintained expressions of perfect innocence.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry you had to make enough for my parents, too."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After they had finished dinner and chatted pleasantly for another couple of hours, it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was finally time to break up the party.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Of course, since Amane's parents would be sleeping in his living room, Mahiru was the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        only one going home.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had sent his parents to bathe, so he was the only one who stepped outside to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        see Mahiru off.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was no need for him to do so, but he wanted the chance to apologize for his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mother and father, just in case.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, it's all right. This was fun."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It was?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was glad that she didn't appear upset.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If anything, she seemed like she had enjoyed herself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Besides—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I got a small taste of happiness, so—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's thin voice was almost like a sigh. She smiled but also looked very lonely all<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of a sudden. It was a fleeting smile, one that seemed like it could be carried away by<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the breeze. Amane was starting to piece together a picture of her situation at home, so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he thought he recognized the faint look of yearning in her eyes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Somehow, he couldn't leave it alone, and Amane put his palm on her head and stroked<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her hair.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru looked up at Amane in surprise, but she didn't seem to hate it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Wh-what are you doing?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nothing."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's not nothing… My hair's all messed up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're getting in the bath anyway, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I am, but—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Did you hate it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I—I didn't hate it, but… you could at least say something first."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Here we go."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's saying something after."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        So it's okay to touch you as long as I tell you first? Amane thought, but he knew better<p></p>
        <p></p>
        than to say it out loud.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru let out a small sigh.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Geez… I'm fine with it, but it's really not appropriate to rub a girl's head so casually."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But I don't do it to anyone else…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane understood that the only time it was okay to touch a person of the opposite<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sex was when you had a close relationship. He wasn't the kind of guy who would go<p></p>
        <p></p>
        around casually rubbing up against girls or anything. The closest he came to that was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smacking Chitose whenever she made a terrible joke.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had thought that maybe he and Mahiru had gotten close enough, so he had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tentatively touched her, hoping she wouldn't hate it, but the thought wouldn't have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        even occurred to him if it was anyone else.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had fallen quiet, but she hadn't shaken off his hand.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm sure you can see it," she said, "but you're the spitting image of your father,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane. It's obvious to me, even though I've only known him a short while."<p></p>
