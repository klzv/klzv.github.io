        <hr class="half">
        <p></p>…I really love this girl… 
        <p></p>Of course, this wasn't a surprise, but Amane could feel his
        <p></p>chest grow hot just from the affection she was directing his
        <p></p>way. He felt overwhelmed with love.
        <p></p>If they had been at home, he would have stroked her hair
        <p></p>and never let her go, but since they were in a public space,
        <p></p>he knew he had to restrain himself.
        <p></p>And so after hugging her for a moment, he whispered, "…
        <p></p>Once we get home, I'll show you how much I love you," and 8
        <p></p>then he let her go. Even though Mahiru was soaked through
        <p></p>with water, her face was as red as a boiled octopus.
        <p></p>"…That's all I've ever wanted," he heard her murmur.
        <p></p>Ultimately, it was Amane who ended up sinking. Holding
        <p></p>back a groan, he closed his eyes and tried to think about
        <p></p>something else.
        <p></p>Seeing Amane like that, Mahiru smiled with great
        <p></p>satisfaction, her cheeks still red, and whispered, "I want to
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>show you my love, too." 6
        <p></p>Amane glared at her, wondering if she wasn't already
        <p></p>doing so, with the way she was acting, and she smiled at him
        <p></p>again.
        <p></p>"I want a chance to be in control, too. Recently, you've
        <p></p>completely outwitted me."
        <p></p>"…No way, you came onto me so aggressively before we 2
        <p></p>were dating. It's still my turn."
        <p></p>"We're skipping over too many of my turns. I want to get
        <p></p>the chance to embarrass you, too."
        <p></p>"So that was your goal all along? …Argh."
        <p></p>Amane knew that Mahiru would have loved to embarrass
        <p></p>him whenever the opportunity presented itself, so he
        <p></p>steadied himself, ready to turn the tables on her.
        <p></p>Mahiru often toyed with him, exposing his pathetic side,
        <p></p>so in an attempt to gain the advantage for once, he made a
        <p></p>show of brushing back some of the hair on the side of her
        <p></p>head and planted a gentle kiss on her cheek.
        <p></p>She seemed to have confidence to spare, but Amane
        <p></p>somehow swallowed the shame that welled up inside him
        <p></p>and peered down at his adorable girlfriend, who was frozen
        <p></p>in place with a bright-red face.
        <p></p>"…Still love me?"
        <p></p>"N-not cute…"
        <p></p>"Well, I've never been much of a charmer. Here, let's go
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>take a break, shall we? I'll go buy us some drinks."
        <p></p>When he ruffled her soaking-wet hair, Mahiru seemed to
        <p></p>unfreeze. She mumbled sulkily, "I'll have an orange juice,"
        <p></p>and then she head-butted him.
        <p></p>It was obviously an attempt to hide her embarrassment,
        <p></p>so Amane laughed quietly and patted her head again.
        <p></p>"So this is what happens when I take my eyes off you?"
        <p></p>When Amane returned from buying drinks, Mahiru was
        <p></p>being hassled by two guys.
        <p></p>This is why I didn't want her out of my sight. This is my
        <p></p>fault, but—
        <p></p>Even though it was a weekday, there was still a long line at
        <p></p>the food court, so it had taken him some time, and sure
        <p></p>enough, two guys had come up to talk to Mahiru.
        <p></p>They were in public, so obviously the guys were less likely
        <p></p>to force her to go with them or anything, but as her 2
        <p></p>boyfriend, Amane was not amused. He didn't even want
        <p></p>random people to talk to her.
        <p></p>Mahiru herself was not even attempting to hide her
        <p></p>annoyance. Apparently strange men hitting on her didn't get
        <p></p>an angelic smile. She had zipped the front of the rash guard
        <p></p>all the way up and wasn't smiling, giving them no openings.
        <p></p>Amane sighed softly.
        <p></p>…They can't even tell how much they're bothering her, so
        <p></p>I doubt they're going to be able to pick up any girls, but…
        <p></p>To begin with, they should have been able to tell that a girl
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>sitting alone, wearing a men's rash guard, who looked like
        <p></p>she was waiting for someone, might already have a partner.
        <p></p>If they hadn't been able to guess, that didn't speak well for
        <p></p>their ability to pick up girls. And if they were able to but
        <p></p>decided to try to pick her up anyway, then they were real
        <p></p>jerks.
        <p></p>Amane was probably thinking such harsh thoughts
        <p></p>because he was annoyed that it was his girlfriend they were 1
        <p></p>hitting on.
        <p></p>Mahiru was sitting politely on the bench and probably
        <p></p>hadn't been able to escape from the men because she didn't
        <p></p>want to leave that spot until Amane came back. Deciding
        <p></p>that he would apologize to her later for making her wait, he
        <p></p>hurried over.
        <p></p>"Sorry for the wait."
        <p></p>The moment he spoke, holding their drinks in both hands,
        <p></p>Mahiru's face lit up. It was obvious that they had been
        <p></p>bothering her.
        <p></p>Mahiru's expression made her look like a completely
        <p></p>different person, and the guys gaped at her as if they had
        <p></p>been caught off guard. They turned to look at Amane.
        <p></p>The two exuded a subtle sense of superiority as they sized
        <p></p>him up, probably because he hadn't dressed up that day—
        <p></p>after all, he couldn't use styling wax when going to the pool,
        <p></p>so he'd only brushed and combed his hair, and it didn't look
        <p></p>as good.
        <p></p>"Sorry, but she's with me, so I'd appreciate it if you would
        <p></p>leave us alone."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane was used to people looking down on him, so he
        <p></p>wasn't bothered by their stares and smiled at them stiffly.
        <p></p>The guys' smirks turned even nastier.
        <p></p>"She's with you? Seriously? What a bad match!"
        <p></p>"A sad sack like you, with a girl like this…? Unbelievable." 2
        <p></p>Sorry for being a sad sack! 5
        <p></p>Amane knew he was plain-looking; he wasn't going to
        <p></p>argue that point. But as to whether he was a good or bad
        <p></p>match for Mahiru, well, he figured that these guys had to be
        <p></p>even less worthy of her. There was no way that the kind of
        <p></p>gaudy guys who walked around making passes at girls would
        <p></p>ever appeal to someone as elegant, beautiful, and ephemeral
        <p></p>as Mahiru.
        <p></p>The whole situation was a headache, and when Amane
        <p></p>was puzzling over how to argue with them without making
        <p></p>them angry, Mahiru suddenly chuckled quietly, "Heh-heh."
        <p></p>He looked at Mahiru, who had laughed out of nowhere,
        <p></p>and she was elegantly holding her hand over her mouth,
        <p></p>covering her smile.
        <p></p>"They're right," she said. "If I had to say whether you were
        <p></p>sunny or gloomy, you're a gloomy one."
        <p></p>"Don't laugh…"
        <p></p>"I know that my boyfriend isn't very cheerful. He's a quiet,
        <p></p>calm person."
        <p></p>Amane watched her attentively, unsure of what Mahiru
        <p></p>was trying to say, as she looked directly at the other guys for
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>the first time.
        <p></p>There was no kindness in her eyes. They seemed cold.
        <p></p>…I bet she's angry.
        <p></p>Mahiru hated it when people made fun of Amane. So he
        <p></p>expected her to show the guys how she felt. She seemed to
        <p></p>despise them.
        <p></p>"And even if he is gloomy, what's wrong with that?" 1
        <p></p>Mahiru's words didn't sound particularly angry.
        <p></p>But in a tone that said they didn't really understand the
        <p></p>problem, the would-be pickup artists responded with a
        <p></p>dumbfounded, "Huh?"
        <p></p>"I love him, whether he's sunny or gloomy, it doesn't
        <p></p>matter. I fell for the whole package—his personality, looks,
        <p></p>and attitude. Whether he seems like a good match is
        <p></p>irrelevant. My love for him isn't such a flimsy thing that I
        <p></p>would ever worry about such questions."
        <p></p>Mahiru made this definitive assertion, then smiled
        <p></p>sweetly at Amane.
        <p></p>He felt his chest grow hot as it was full of love and 1
        <p></p>affection, a smile she never would have shown the other
        <p></p>guys. Amane had never imagined anyone would tell him they
        <p></p>loved him in such a bold way, and while it was a little
        <p></p>embarrassing, the feelings of happiness came to him first.
        <p></p>"I hope that you boys meet wonderful girls someday who
        <p></p>think of you in the same way." 3
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru beamed, but it wasn't the sticky-sweet smile like
        <p></p>gooey honey and chocolate mixed together that she always
        <p></p>used toward Amane. Mahiru finished them off with the
        <p></p>perfect angelic smile that she used in public, and the guys
        <p></p>stared at her, flabbergasted. Their faces were red, like they'd
        <p></p>been scalded by Mahiru's radiant smile. Amane briefly
        <p></p>thought that if she had shown them her real face, the one
        <p></p>that she only showed him, they would have been reduced to
        <p></p>ash.
        <p></p>"Ah, well, um…"
        <p></p>Stammering, one of the guys tried to reach a hand out
        <p></p>toward Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Hey, guys, over there."
        <p></p>Amane casually brushed the outstretched hand away and
        <p></p>pointed past them.
        <p></p>The guys turned to look where Amane was pointing and
        <p></p>saw that there was a man in a lookout tower who was
        <p></p>watching them.
        <p></p>The pool management took safety very seriously, so there
        <p></p>were lookout towers all over the place. The people posted
        <p></p>there were to caution patrons against roughhousing near the
        <p></p>water's edge and to keep anybody from drowning, but of
        <p></p>course they were also monitoring whether there were any
        <p></p>suspicious characters lurking about.
        <p></p>Once the two guys realized that the employee was looking
        <p></p>at them, they ran off in a hurry with embarrassed
        <p></p>expressions. Amane didn't feel bad for laughing at them for
        <p></p>being cowards, despite having had the courage to chat up a
        <p></p>girl out of their league who looked like she was already there
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>with a guy.
        <p></p>It was finally just the two of them, so Amane sat down
        <p></p>beside Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Sorry for taking so long."
        <p></p>He figured the first thing he needed to do was apologize.
        <p></p>After all, Mahiru had been placed in an uncomfortable
        <p></p>situation because he had left her alone.
        <p></p>"No, it was busy, wasn't it? Plus, that happens all the time
        <p></p>when I'm by myself."
        <p></p>"…I'm sure that's true, but it's my fault you were left
        <p></p>alone. I bet you were scared."
        <p></p>"They seemed to understand what I was saying, so I
        <p></p>wasn't afraid."
        <p></p>I doubt they were listening to you; I think they just left
        <p></p>because other people started staring.
        <p></p>The exchange probably would have gone on a little longer
        <p></p>if the pool employee hadn't been there. Amane would have
        <p></p>gotten fed up with it halfway through and tried to take
        <p></p>Mahiru's hand and leave, but whether the other guys would
        <p></p>have let them go was a different matter. 2
        <p></p>Amane handed Mahiru the orange juice she had requested
        <p></p>and drank some of his own soda through a straw.
        <p></p>"…You weren't scared?" he asked.
        <p></p>"No, more like upset that they ruined my good mood."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Sorry. Cheer up, okay?"
        <p></p>"It wasn't your fault, but…all right, okay, let me have a sip
        <p></p>of your drink, and it's a deal." Mahiru pointed to the soda
        <p></p>Amane was drinking and smiled impishly.
        <p></p>"I can't say no to you." He smiled wryly and handed her
        <p></p>his cup.
        <p></p>He could tell that she was acting deliberately playful so he
        <p></p>wouldn't feel too guilty, and he recognized the thoughtful
        <p></p>understanding behind her words.
        <p></p>Without saying anything more about what had just
        <p></p>happened, Mahiru took the soda from Amane and sipped
        <p></p>it…frowning with determination. Her eyes even filled with
        <p></p>tears.
        <p></p>It was a strongly carbonated beverage, but not enough to
        <p></p>cause such an intense reaction. Amane hadn't been bothered
        <p></p>by it, but that didn't seem to be the case for Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Uh, did it taste weird?"
        <p></p>"…No, I just rarely have carbonated drinks… They really
        <p></p>irritate the throat, don't they?"
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes were watering from the strong sensation.
        <p></p>Come to think of it, Mahiru only drank water, tea, coffee,
        <p></p>and sometimes fruit juice. That was it; he had never seen her
        <p></p>drinking a carbonated beverage before.
        <p></p>Mahiru wasn't that sensitive to spicy foods, but she didn't
        <p></p>seem to care for this kind of bubbly sensation.
        <p></p>"I'm surprised you would want a sip of something like
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>this; you never drink soda… So why did you want to try it?"
        <p></p>Seems like she could have anticipated this would happen.
        <p></p>He took his drink back from Mahiru and patted her head.
        <p></p>She looked up at him, eyes still watery from the fizziness.
        <p></p>"…Because I wanted to enjoy the flavor with you, Amane," 3
        <p></p>she mumbled quietly.
        <p></p>Amane nearly dropped the soda, narrowly avoiding a 1
        <p></p>disaster.
        <p></p>…My girlfriend is utterly adorable. 1
        <p></p>Amane wondered if "utterly" might sound disparaging,
        <p></p>but he meant it as high praise. Also, he was in agony.
        <p></p>Even at the best of times, he found it hard to deal with
        <p></p>how cute her appearance and mannerisms were, and when
        <p></p>she said that she wanted to share the same drink, he had to
        <p></p>stifle a groan.
        <p></p>Mahiru was too cute to even look at. Amane turned away,
        <p></p>just holding on to Mahiru's hand, and she leaned against
        <p></p>him, hooking her arm in his.
        <p></p>"…Me too. I want a sip of your orange juice later." 3
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, sure." Mahiru laughed faintly.
        <p></p>Without looking at her, he put his elbow up on the bench's
        <p></p>armrest and faced the opposite direction.
        <p></p>That was probably why he didn't notice them getting
        <p></p>closer.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Hey, you over there, the cute little lady and the sad sack
        <p></p>little boy, you wanna play with us?" 1
        <p></p>Someone called out to the two of them in a familiar,
        <p></p>easygoing tone. Amane recognized it, but he hadn't been
        <p></p>expecting to hear it.
        <p></p>When Amane looked toward the voice, he saw exactly the
        <p></p>faces he predicted:
        <p></p>A handsome, if shallow-looking, male and a boyish but 1
        <p></p>beautiful girl. Both faces he saw frequently at school.
        <p></p>Amane shot them a suspicious look without really
        <p></p>meaning to, but he didn't feel bad about it.
        <p></p>"Why are you here, Itsuki?"
        <p></p>"I'm not stalking you, promise. It's a coincidence,
        <p></p>seriously," Itsuki earnestly insisted. "You know I'm not that
        <p></p>nosy." He waved his hand dismissively.
        <p></p>Amane decided that their friends probably hadn't been
        <p></p>following them. For one thing, if they had been watching,
        <p></p>Itsuki and Chitose would surely have come to Mahiru's
        <p></p>rescue when she was getting hit on.
        <p></p>He figured that, in terms of timing, they had probably
        <p></p>spotted Mahiru after he'd rejoined her at the bench. It was
        <p></p>also clear from Chitose's expression that this was just a
        <p></p>coincidence.
        <p></p>"I mean, we heard that you were going to the pool
        <p></p>sometime this week, but of course I never expected to bump
        <p></p>into you in such a big place, even if we showed up on the
        <p></p>same day. Sorry for intruding on your lovey-dovey time."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Hey—"
        <p></p>Amane wasn't going to complain, since they had run into
        <p></p>each other by chance, but he cast a sharp glance at Chitose,
        <p></p>who had a big grin when she teased him.
        <p></p>Which is to say, he ended up glaring directly at her, since
        <p></p>Chitose was also in her bathing suit, and it would have been
        <p></p>rude to look at her body too much.
        <p></p>Chitose was wearing an orange top and swim shorts.
        <p></p>When she noticed Amane staring at her, she smirked again
        <p></p>and shouted, "Oh no, a pervert!" and wriggled around, even
        <p></p>though it was obvious from the direction of his gaze that he
        <p></p>wasn't looking at her body.
        <p></p>Letting out a huge sigh at Chitose's ridiculousness, Amane
        <p></p>appealed to Itsuki with an imploring look, but Itsuki said,
        <p></p>"It's summer, so she's got too much energy." He didn't seem 1
        <p></p>inclined to try to stop her.
        <p></p>Feeling exasperated, Amane turned to Mahiru and saw
        <p></p>that she had unzipped the front of the rash guard, which was
        <p></p>previously zipped up to hide herself from the wannabe
        <p></p>pickup artists. Even though it was a rash guard, she must
        <p></p>have been hot with the fastener closed all the way up to her
        <p></p>neck.
        <p></p>She had unfastened it down to her chest and was fanning
        <p></p>a little air through the shirt.
        <p></p>Chitose blinked at her, "Hmm? Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Yes?"
        <p></p>"…You wore that bikini?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"This one?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, I mean, you got the other black string— Mmph!"
        <p></p>Chitose's voice was muffled midway through her sentence
        <p></p>by Mahiru forcibly covering up her mouth. 3
        <p></p>Mahiru had risen halfway to her feet to reach Chitose. She
        <p></p>must have realized that Amane was staring at her, because
        <p></p>she froze.
        <p></p>"…It's nothing," Mahiru said, shaking her head. Her
        <p></p>cheeks were red.
        <p></p>"There was another swimsuit."
        <p></p>"No, ah, that one, well… I'm embarrassed to wear that one
        <p></p>in public, so…"
        <p></p>"You were about to spill out of it, huh? I thought it would
        <p></p>be cute for you to wear when you and Amane were alone—
        <p></p>Mmph!"
        <p></p>"Chitose, you need to shut up now."
        <p></p>"O-okay!"
        <p></p>Mahiru covered Chitose's mouth again. Chitose seemed
        <p></p>absolutely remorseless.
        <p></p>Amane was surprised to hear Mahiru had purchased a
        <p></p>swimsuit that she would be hesitant to wear in public, but
        <p></p>once she said that it was for when they were alone together,
        <p></p>his heart seemed like it would go crazy at the boldness of it
        <p></p>all.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Is it really that risqué?"
        <p></p>"Not really. Mahiru has good taste; it's just that it doesn't
        <p></p>cover much."
        <p></p>"Chitose…"
        <p></p>"If I say any more, I think she's really going to get pissed
        <p></p>at me, so please understand you'll just have to see it for
        <p></p>yourself, Amane."
        <p></p>"I-I'm not showing!"
        <p></p>Mahiru rejected the idea outright, her face as red as a ripe
        <p></p>apple. Amane didn't feel guilty about being a little 1
        <p></p>disappointed.
        <p></p>Of course, if Mahiru was opposed to it, he wouldn't tell
        <p></p>her he wanted to see it no matter what, but still, it would be
        <p></p>a lie if he said that he didn't want to see his girlfriend like
        <p></p>that.
        <p></p>From the way Chitose was talking, the other bathing suit
        <p></p>wasn't just revealing, it was a bold expression of Mahiru's
        <p></p>fine style.
        <p></p>At the moment, Amane was having a very hard time
        <p></p>looking straight at her, but assuming that the other one
        <p></p>revealed even more skin, Mahiru's refusal was probably his
        <p></p>saving grace.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>But of course, as a young man, he would have liked to see
        <p></p>it.
        <p></p>Maybe he looked a little disappointed, because Chitose
        <p></p>smirked, and Mahiru repeatedly glanced at him with
        <p></p>uncertainty.
        <p></p>"You won't show him?" Chitose asked.
        <p></p>"…That's not up for discussion right now," Mahiru feebly
        <p></p>responded. Then, as if to escape from Chitose's and Amane's
        <p></p>gazes, she put up the hood on the rash guard and hung her
        <p></p>head.
        <p></p>Even if Amane couldn't see her face, he could imagine that
        <p></p>it was burning red, enough to make it look like she had
        <p></p>gotten a sunburn.
        <p></p>"…Chitose, don't tease her too badly. And, Mahiru, you
        <p></p>don't need to worry about what I think."
        <p></p>"But she's such a cutie!"
        <p></p>"Why say something so obvious?"
        <p></p>"Oh, this boy's a natural…" 1
        <p></p>Mahiru being cute was an indisputable fact, but when he
        <p></p>agreed with her, Chitose looked at Amane with faint
        <p></p>amazement in her eyes.
        <p></p>Before they started dating, Amane already knew from the
        <p></p>beginning that Mahiru was cute, so it wasn't that surprising
        <p></p>of a thing to say. But his friends seemed to be bewildered to
        <p></p>hear him say it, and their eyes went wide.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Well, if you didn't wind up infatuated in the end,
        <p></p>Amane… You used to say you would never get a girlfriend
        <p></p>and never fall in love, but look at you now…"
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>"You know, the feeling of being in love will change a
        <p></p>person!"
        <p></p>"Will you two quit making fun of me? First of all, Mahiru 7
        <p></p>being cute is a well-known fact, and anyway it's normal to 1
        <p></p>think that your girlfriend is attractive. Itsuki, you're 2
        <p></p>constantly bragging about how cute Chitose is."
        <p></p>Itsuki had been going on and on about his girlfriend ever
        <p></p>since Amane had known him. Compared to that, Amane
        <p></p>hadn't said much at all.
        <p></p>When Amane turned the tables and looked fed up with the
        <p></p>two of them, insisting that it wasn't such a strange thing for
        <p></p>him to feel that way about Mahiru, they shrugged defeatedly.
        <p></p>Amane glared at them, feeling slightly irritated by their
        <p></p>attitude, but Itsuki just smiled wryly.
        <p></p>"Ah, but I think we'd better leave it there for now."
        <p></p>"What do you mean?"
        <p></p>"Mahiru looks like she's having a hard time."
        <p></p>At Itsuki's mention of Mahiru, Amane looked over and
        <p></p>saw she was holding the hood down over her head and
        <p></p>trembling, probably feeling extremely self-conscious.
        <p></p>He knew she felt shy about being complimented too much
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>in front of other people. She looked up at him, her eyes filled
        <p></p>with tears of mortification.
        <p></p>"…That's a good and bad thing about you, Amane," she
        <p></p>mumbled, hiding deep within the hood.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't do anything but wait for Mahiru to pull
        <p></p>herself together.
        <p></p>Once Mahiru recovered from her embarrassment, the four
        <p></p>of them hung out together, which was great because it made
        <p></p>it much harder for any other guys to approach Mahiru.
        <p></p>As long as the four of them moved as a group, no one
        <p></p>would be left alone, and Amane was paying close attention
        <p></p>to make sure it didn't happen again.
        <p></p>Moreover, since Itsuki was obviously outgoing and
        <p></p>handsome, the Platonic ideal of a cheerful guy, and the type
        <p></p>who had a friendly aura about him, any men who might have
        <p></p>been aiming to pick up one of the girls probably thought
        <p></p>better of it after one look at him.
        <p></p>However, since Chitose, Mahiru, and Itsuki were all
        <p></p>extremely attractive, Amane couldn't help but feel like all
        <p></p>eyes were on them.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, Mahiru, take this!"
        <p></p>"Kyah! …Geez, come on, Chitose!"
        <p></p>Without saying anything, Mahiru had pushed the group
        <p></p>toward playing in the shallow pool.
        <p></p>Mahiru and Chitose were happily splashing each other,
        <p></p>while Amane sat on the edge of the pool and watched them.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>It was charming, watching two girls who were such good
        <p></p>friends cheerfully playing around.
        <p></p>Also, they were both exceptionally beautiful in different
        <p></p>ways, so watching them was a feast for the eyes.
        <p></p>"Man, it's so nice to see the girls getting along like that."
        <p></p>Itsuki was sitting beside Amane, watching them with a
        <p></p>grin.
        <p></p>"You sound like a creepy old man," Amane replied.
        <p></p>"How rude! You're one to talk, ogling them while they
        <p></p>play."
        <p></p>"I'm not that bad."
        <p></p>"But I bet you were thinking about how nice it was to
        <p></p>watch, you taciturn guy."
        <p></p>"I could say the same about you."
        <p></p>"At least I'm honest about it," Itsuki quipped, gazing idly
        <p></p>at Mahiru, who was giggling as she splashed Chitose with
        <p></p>water.
        <p></p>"So why were you watching her with that faraway look in
        <p></p>your eyes?" Itsuki asked, wiping the foolish grin from his
        <p></p>face. He leaned forward a little bit and peered at Amane.
        <p></p>"Well, how do I put this? Mahiru seems to have gotten
        <p></p>even cuter than before."
        <p></p>"Listen to you, going on about your girlfriend, too."
        <p></p>"I'm not bragging; it's just—she smiles a lot now. She
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>didn't used to smile this way at all."
        <p></p>"We never saw her back then, but…do you mean she was
        <p></p>cold?"
        <p></p>"Yeah. She was always cool and had a sharp tongue. It was
        <p></p>because she didn't trust anyone… I was thinking it's nice to
        <p></p>see her this way now."
        <p></p>Compared to when they first met, Mahiru smiled much
        <p></p>more openly now.
        <p></p>She had a carefree smile and honesty to her that seemed
        <p></p>unrecognizable compared to the distant and sharp-tongued
        <p></p>Mahiru of the past.
        <p></p>Amane felt proud that Mahiru had changed because of
        <p></p>him, but it was also thanks to Chitose. Since they were both
        <p></p>girls, they could talk about things together and understand
        <p></p>each other.
        <p></p>Whenever he saw the two of them having fun together, as
        <p></p>they were just then, he felt really happy.
        <p></p>"I agree; I've also been thinking that Mahiru has changed
        <p></p>a lot. She used to be like some kind of statue, and hard to
        <p></p>approach, but now all I can see is a supercute girl who loves
        <p></p>Amane."
        <p></p>"Who loves me…? Listen—"
        <p></p>"I mean, it's easy to tell, with that much pure affection
        <p></p>directed your way. Even on a normal day, it's obvious that
        <p></p>she treats you special."
        <p></p>"…By the way, I want to ask, from what you could see, has
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru been interested in me for a really long time?"
        <p></p>"If anything, she was brimming over with love, wondering
        <p></p>what was taking you so long."
        <p></p>"Seriously?"
        <p></p>He'd had a vague inkling that she liked him since before
        <p></p>they started dating, but apparently Itsuki had seen it even
        <p></p>before Amane had considered the possibility.
        <p></p>"I think that Mahiru probably started to change around
        <p></p>the time she started to trust you and like you," Itsuki said.
        <p></p>"I wonder…?"
        <p></p>"And having Chi around maybe helped, too. She's
        <p></p>excitable and friendly, for better or worse, so she pulled
        <p></p>Mahiru out of her shell."
        <p></p>"…I'm begging you to get your girlfriend under control."
        <p></p>"It's fine, it's fine. Chi never treads where she really can't
        <p></p>go. Besides, look, they're smiling so much."
        <p></p>When Amane looked over to where Itsuki was pointing
        <p></p>again, Chitose was hanging onto Mahiru, who looked
        <p></p>embarrassed yet accepting of her own shyness.
        <p></p>He could tell from the look in her eyes and her soft
        <p></p>expression that Mahiru trusted Chitose as well. It was good
        <p></p>that she was finding more friends to depend on.
        <p></p>But he wanted to be person she relied on the most.
        <p></p>Itsuki patted Amane on the back to tell him not to worry,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>and Amane responded with a wry smile.
        <p></p>"Hey, hey, you melancholy young men there standing by
        <p></p>the poolside, come over here and play with us!" Chitose
        <p></p>waved at them as she clung to Mahiru.
        <p></p>Mahiru waved her hand reservedly, too, looking like she
        <p></p>wanted Amane to join them.
        <p></p>"When you get invited by a couple of cute girls, there's no
        <p></p>way you don't answer their calls." Itsuki plunged into the
        <p></p>pool with a grin and headed toward the girls. Smiling,
        <p></p>Amane watched him go, and he, too, took off toward Mahiru
        <p></p>and the others.
        <p></p>"Whew, we really played a lot!"
        <p></p>After enjoying themselves for several hours, they were
        <p></p>naturally a little tired, despite being high school students,
        <p></p>and the four teenagers sat down on a bench to rest.
        <p></p>They had borrowed a ball to play volleyball, and at
        <p></p>Chitose's insistence, Mahiru had tried going down a small
        <p></p>waterslide, which had been an exciting experience for her.
        <p></p>Sitting beside Amane, Mahiru looked refreshed but must
        <p></p>have been fairly exhausted, because she was leaning lightly
        <p></p>against him.
        <p></p>"That was fun, huh? It's been a long time since I played
        <p></p>like that," she said.
        <p></p>"Mm, me too," Amane agreed. "It's been a while since I
        <p></p>moved around that much."
        <p></p>"Well, you didn't participate any more than you had to at
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Sports Day, eh, Amane? I bet swimming was good exercise,"
        <p></p>Itsuki remarked.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't exactly unathletic, but sports still weren't
        <p></p>his strong suit, and he rarely got such a total workout. Even
        <p></p>during gym, though he took the class seriously, he never
        <p></p>worked his whole body into a good sweat.
        <p></p>"Partway, you went for a serious swim, didn't you,
        <p></p>Amane?"
        <p></p>"Well, a pool is a place for swimming, so…I think it's nice
        <p></p>to swim from time to time."
        <p></p>"Mahiru was watching you while you swam, you know?"
        <p></p>Chitose added.
        <p></p>"Ah, s-sorry, Mahiru."
        <p></p>Mahiru had been playing happily with Chitose, so Amane
        <p></p>had gone off to enjoy some light swimming, but he realized
        <p></p>he might have made her wait around for him.
        <p></p>But Mahiru shook her head.
        <p></p>"Y-you don't need to apologize, but…it must be nice."
        <p></p>After a little thought, Amane figured out what she meant.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't know how to swim, so she must have been
        <p></p>jealous of Amane, who could do so without any issues.
        <p></p>But he definitely wouldn't out her in front of Chitose and
        <p></p>Itsuki, so he just smiled softly and stroked her hair. If they
        <p></p>had another opportunity, it would probably be good to
        <p></p>practice swimming.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Let's go to the pool together again sometime," Amane
        <p></p>suggested.
        <p></p>"O-okay."
        <p></p>"Huh, what's that?" Chitose interrupted. "You say you
        <p></p>want to see Mahiru's black bikini?"
        <p></p>"You idiot, I definitely don't want to suggest she wear that
        <p></p>in public."
        <p></p>"But you want to appreciate it when you're alone?"
        <p></p>Chitose prodded.
        <p></p>"That's…different, since I'm her boyfriend, right?"
        <p></p>Thinking about Mahiru wearing a black bikini in front of
        <p></p>everyone made Amane uncomfortable. Even though she
        <p></p>wore his rash guard, he would have liked it if she had also
        <p></p>put on swimming shorts.
        <p></p>"Come on, Mahiru, you're not gonna show him?"
        <p></p>"I said we'll talk about it later."
        <p></p>Mahiru turned away uncooperatively. Amane smiled
        <p></p>slightly and patted her head gently again.
        <p></p>The group left the water park together and went to a
        <p></p>diner.
        <p></p>It was six o'clock, which was usually a little early for
        <p></p>dinner, but they had been swimming, playing, and using up
        <p></p>so much energy that they were hungry and figured it was the
        <p></p>perfect time to eat.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru had never had the chance to go to a diner before
        <p></p>and was a little nervous. She looked cute fidgeting, and
        <p></p>Amane laughed in spite of himself. She slapped him from an
        <p></p>angle that Chitose and Itsuki couldn't see, and he reined it
        <p></p>in.
        <p></p>"That reminds me—you're going to Amane's parents'
        <p></p>house over the summer break, right, Mahiru?" Chitose asked
        <p></p>as she cut into her hamburger steak.
        <p></p>Mahiru had probably told her she was going with Amane
        <p></p>to his family home so they could make plans together. Now,
        <p></p>of course, Chitose was smirking at him.
        <p></p>"Oh yeah, that—you're going there to introduce yourself,
        <p></p>right?" Itsuki asked.
        <p></p>"Unfortunately, Mahiru has already met my parents."
        <p></p>"Oh, that's right… Well, at this point, it's more like a wife
        <p></p>accompanying her husband for his homecoming, huh?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah, say whatever you like."
        <p></p>The two of them weren't even close to being married—or 9
        <p></p>even engaged. So Amane's first thought was to question
        <p></p>what Itsuki was saying. But it was unusual for high schoolers
        <p></p>in a relationship to go for such a long visit with each other's
        <p></p>parents, so there was at least something to his friend's
        <p></p>observation.
        <p></p>Amane quickly let the subject drop and took a bite of the
        <p></p>rolled omelet from the Japanese set menu. Chitose didn't
        <p></p>crack a joke, but instead she looked at him with
        <p></p>disappointment.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Ignoring her, he continued to eat, but somehow the eggs
        <p></p>were unsatisfactory. They had a bland, flat taste, unlike
        <p></p>Mahiru's omelets, and though he didn't complain, they left
        <p></p>him feeling unsatisfied.
        <p></p>Convinced that Mahiru's cooking was the best after all,
        <p></p>Amane glanced over at her and saw she looked slightly
        <p></p>embarrassed.
        <p></p>Apparently the talk of her being his wife made her shy.
        <p></p>"So you're going to Amane's house, huh…? His mom must
        <p></p>be thrilled," Itsuki remarked.
        <p></p>"You're acquainted with Amane's mother, Itsuki?"
        <p></p>"No, but I've heard about her… And from Amane's stories,
        <p></p>I've got a good picture of what she's like."
        <p></p>"My mom is a lot… Every time, it's like she's never met a
        <p></p>stranger."
        <p></p>It seemed like Itsuki had immediately been able to tell,
        <p></p>just by hearing about her, that Amane's mother had a lot in
        <p></p>common with Chitose. If the two of them met, they would
        <p></p>probably feel a sense of kinship.
        <p></p>"Huh, what's that?"
        <p></p>"Mm, just talking about how cute you are, Chi."
        <p></p>Itsuki casually dodged the question with a compliment,
        <p></p>and Chitose looked delighted.
        <p></p>"Oh, you!" she fawned. "Ah, and by the way, Amane, let
        <p></p>me know as soon as you've decided the dates for your trip
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>home. I want to hang out with Mahiru before you go."
        <p></p>"Sure thing. We'll probably go in August, so you can have
        <p></p>at it until then… Just don't forget to do your homework."
        <p></p>"Why do you sound like my mom?"
        <p></p>"I believe last year you made a big fuss about not being
        <p></p>done with your homework, so…"
        <p></p>Chitose was the type to procrastinate and then panic, 7
        <p></p>trying to get everything done before the end of the break.
        <p></p>On the other hand, Amane was the type to get it done
        <p></p>early then review a little every day, while Itsuki liked to work
        <p></p>slowly but steadily, so both of them had gotten stuck helping
        <p></p>Chitose with her work before.
        <p></p>This year Amane had already finished his assignments,
        <p></p>and Mahiru had as well, so they had been reviewing
        <p></p>together.
        <p></p>"But I don't wanna do it… Ah! Maybe this year I can get a
        <p></p>sweet angel to teach me?"
        <p></p>"I don't mind teaching you, but the next time you call me
        <p></p>an angel, I'm rescinding the offer."
        <p></p>"Ah, so strict! But I love stern Mahiru, too."
        <p></p>Thinking how charming it was to see Mahiru sharing
        <p></p>friendly banter with Chitose, Amane took another bite of his
        <p></p>food before it got cold.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, tomorrow I'd like to eat omelets."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>She was sitting beside him, and when he told her this in a
        <p></p>quiet voice, Mahiru's gaze shifted to the tray in front of
        <p></p>Amane.
        <p></p>"You're eating one right now, aren't you?"
        <p></p>"This one's no good. Somehow the flavor is lacking. Yours
        <p></p>are the best."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, you're hopeless. All right, I'll wake you up
        <p></p>tomorrow with breakfast."
        <p></p>"Mm."
        <p></p>During summer vacation, Amane stopped getting up
        <p></p>early, so he would be grateful for Mahiru if she did.
        <p></p>It would probably be bad for his heart to see her face first
        <p></p>thing, but there could be no doubt that it would be an
        <p></p>extraordinary way to start the day.
        <p></p>Amane was in a good mood, and as he looked forward to
        <p></p>tomorrow's breakfast, Itsuki stared at him in astonishment.
        <p></p>"You're basically living together…" 4
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>Only half living together, but he didn't say that out loud
        <p></p>and quietly sipped his slightly cooled miso soup.

        <p></p>Chapter 65: Homecoming, and Revealing the Relationship
        <p></p>"Did you lock all your doors and windows?"
        <p></p>"You watched me do it, didn't you?"
        <p></p>In the hallway in front of their apartments, Mahiru
        <p></p>reminded Amane as if she was his teacher or something, and
        <p></p>he answered with a small, wry smile.
        <p></p>Normally she wouldn't go out of her way to say something
        <p></p>like that, but she seemed to be worried, since their places
        <p></p>would be vacant for a while.
        <p></p>They were leaving that day to go back to Amane's family
        <p></p>home for about two weeks, and Mahiru was making sure
        <p></p>that nothing would happen while they were away.
        <p></p>"I did see you do it, but I'm asking just in case."
        <p></p>"Okay, okay. My turn—you didn't forget anything, did
        <p></p>you?"
        <p></p>"I didn't. We already sent everything we needed ahead of
        <p></p>time, and I checked my handbag again early this morning.
        <p></p>Everything is locked up tight, and I took out the garbage
        <p></p>from your place, and then I went over the contents of the
        <p></p>fridge, so you can rest easy."
        <p></p>"Thanks for going to all that trouble."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Naturally, there was no way they could carry everything
        <p></p>they needed for two weeks with them, so she had employed a
        <p></p>parcel service so nothing would go overlooked. On top of
        <p></p>that, Mahiru had taken care of everything at Amane's
        <p></p>apartment. He was no match for her.
        <p></p>Feeling grateful that she paid attention to such details,
        <p></p>Amane took Mahiru's bag from her and replaced it with his
        <p></p>hand.
        <p></p>After blinking several times, Mahiru said quietly and
        <p></p>bashfully, "That's one thing I like about you, Amane," and
        <p></p>squeezed his hand.
        <p></p>Amane's family home was located a little more than an
        <p></p>hour's distance away by bullet train from where he and
        <p></p>Mahiru lived in the city.
        <p></p>The two of them sat down in their reserved seats and
        <p></p>amused themselves by chatting and enjoying the scenery,
        <p></p>and in no time the train was pulling into Amane's
        <p></p>hometown.
        <p></p>It had been about a year since he had seen that station,
        <p></p>but it felt longer, and an inexpressible wave of nostalgia
        <p></p>came over him as he pulled Mahiru along by the hand to the
        <p></p>rendezvous spot.
        <p></p>"So this is your hometown."
        <p></p>"Mm-hmm. Well, that's not exactly right, since you can't
        <p></p>get to my house without changing trains or going a little
        <p></p>farther by car."
        <p></p>The bullet train only stopped at major stations, so they'd
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>had to get off here, but it would actually take a little more
        <p></p>time to get to where they were going.
        <p></p>This time, his mother had been available, so she had
        <p></p>offered to come meet them, and they had taken her up on it.
        <p></p>Her offer was probably motivated by the desire to see
        <p></p>Mahiru as soon as possible.
        <p></p>Walking toward the large pillar near the ticket gates that
        <p></p>was often used as a meetup spot, Amane spotted his mother,
        <p></p>even at a distance.
        <p></p>Naturally, Amane felt awkward about holding hands in
        <p></p>front of his mother, so he let go of Mahiru's hand. He sensed
        <p></p>a slight air of dejection coming from her, so he patted her
        <p></p>back lightly.
        <p></p>Forgive me just this once, since we haven't told her we're
        <p></p>dating yet.
        <p></p>It had become routine for them to hold hands, so he was
        <p></p>likely to take her hand without thinking about it, which he
        <p></p>would need to be more careful of while they were visiting.
        <p></p>Even Mahiru, who was a little reluctant to let go, seemed
        <p></p>to understand once she spotted Shihoko and regained her
        <p></p>usual expression.
        <p></p>Once Amane's mother saw the two of them, she put on a
        <p></p>charming, cheerful smile as they approached.
        <p></p>"So nice to see you again."
        <p></p>"Welcome, welcome, Mahiru dear! I'm so glad that you
        <p></p>came!"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane smiled wryly, thinking it was just like his mother
        <p></p>to greet Mahiru first.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed a little overwhelmed by Shihoko's energy,
        <p></p>but she gracefully bowed with a smile. "Thank you very
        <p></p>much for inviting me. And thank you for allowing me to join
        <p></p>you during your precious family time…"
        <p></p>"Never mind all that; we wanted to see you, Mahiru dear!
        <p></p>Actually, we wanted to see you over spring break, too, but it
        <p></p>didn't work out… Oh, Amane, what's wrong?"
        <p></p>"You're not going to greet your son?"
        <p></p>"Oh dear. Welcome home, Amane. Thank you for bringing
        <p></p>Mahiru."
        <p></p>"Yeah, sure."
        <p></p>He knew his mother was only teasing him, so he wasn't
        <p></p>particularly upset by it. When she noticed how brusque he
        <p></p>was, she pressed him further. "Oh, quit sulking, dear. Of
        <p></p>course I'm happy you've come back to visit, Amane!"
        <p></p>He couldn't help but be irritated by the way she smirked
        <p></p>at him.
        <p></p>Brushing off his mother's hand with a huff, Amane looked
        <p></p>around. He was surprised his father hadn't come to meet
        <p></p>them as well. Amane was sure he also had the day off from
        <p></p>work and had thought that both of them were coming.
        <p></p>"Where's Dad?"
        <p></p>"Your father's at home now fixing lunch."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Got it."
        <p></p>That made sense once she said it.
        <p></p>His father liked cooking and enjoyed hosting guests, so he
        <p></p>was getting everything ready at home.
        <p></p>"We're in luck, Mahiru; Dad's cooking is great," he told
        <p></p>her, swallowing his opinion that it wasn't as good as
        <p></p>Mahiru's, though.
        <p></p>Mahiru giggled softly. "So I've heard. I'm looking forward
        <p></p>to it."
        <p></p>"Oh-hoh-hoh. Please, come enjoy the tastes of our
        <p></p>homemade food."
        <p></p>"Look who's talking; it's not like you're the one doing the
        <p></p>cooking… Well, Dad is better at it anyway, so that's fine."
        <p></p>"Really, that was uncalled for."
        <p></p>Shihoko puffed out her cheeks in an immature expression.
        <p></p>But it was a fact that Shuuto was the better cook.
        <p></p>Amane's mother made the meals on weekdays while his
        <p></p>father cooked on the weekends, so even though Shihoko had
        <p></p>more chances to practice, his father's cooking always tasted
        <p></p>much better. That wasn't to say that Shihoko was an
        <p></p>especially bad cook, just that when it came to the issue of
        <p></p>seasoning, Shuuto's food was tastier. Of course, Amane was
        <p></p>grateful to them both for cooking.
        <p></p>"Well, that's fine; Amane being uncooperative is nothing
        <p></p>new. More importantly, should we head home? If we leave
        <p></p>now, I think we'll get there just in time for lunch. The car's
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>this way; come on."
        <p></p>Shihoko beckoned them toward the exit, saying the train
        <p></p>station was no place to be having a long conversation.
        <p></p>Amane looked at Mahiru for a moment.
        <p></p>"Ready to go?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>Mahiru gave a little nod, and he squeezed her wrist gently.
        <p></p>Naturally, he couldn't entwine his fingers with hers, but
        <p></p>by holding her wrist, he could play it off as making sure she
        <p></p>didn't get lost.
        <p></p>Mahiru opened her eyes wide, then leaned in a little bit
        <p></p>closer to him, wearing a happy but slightly bashful smile,
        <p></p>and Amane started walking slowly behind his mother, also
        <p></p>feeling a little shy.
        <p></p>They rode in the car for thirty minutes, bringing Amane
        <p></p>and Mahiru's travel time to about two hours, before they
        <p></p>arrived at the Fujimiya household.
        <p></p>A fairly large, detached house stood before their eyes. It
        <p></p>was a spacious home with a den, a big kitchen, and spare
        <p></p>rooms, and it must have been bigger than Mahiru was
        <p></p>expecting, because her eyes widened.
        <p></p>"It's huge!"
        <p></p>"Oh, thank you. We built it to have extra space. We really
        <p></p>wanted a daughter, too, so we included extra rooms, but we
        <p></p>can't get everything we want in life, can we? …You can come
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>live with us if you like!"
        <p></p>"Ah, um, I—"
        <p></p>"Mom, don't tease Mahiru; she doesn't know how to
        <p></p>answer."
        <p></p>"My, my."
        <p></p>His mother smiled brightly, but it seemed like she was
        <p></p>grinning at Mahiru's reaction.
        <p></p>Mahiru cast her eyes down in embarrassment, which he
        <p></p>knew would only feed his mother's happy delusions. As for
        <p></p>Amane's feelings on the matter, he hoped they would one
        <p></p>day be more than just fantasies, but of course he couldn't tell
        <p></p>his mother that.
        <p></p>"Come on, it's hot out here; let's hurry up and get inside."
        <p></p>"Yes, yes, you're no fun."
        <p></p>"What's that supposed to mean…?"
        <p></p>Amane herded his mother toward the house. He could tell
        <p></p>that it was hopeless. She was grinning with delight as she
        <p></p>unlocked the front door.
        <p></p>They heard footsteps from the interior. Amane's father
        <p></p>had noticed their arrival.
        <p></p>"Welcome home."
        <p></p>When they stepped inside the house, as expected, Shuuto
        <p></p>was waiting for them.
        <p></p>"I'm home, Shuuto. And I brought Mahiru!"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"It's nice to see you again, Shiina."
        <p></p>"It's been a while; I'm glad to see you're doing well."
        <p></p>It had been about half a year since Mahiru had last met
        <p></p>Amane's father, and as expected, she seemed nervous. His
        <p></p>mother acted frank, friendly, and too forward with Mahiru,
        <p></p>so they were probably on more familiar terms, but he figured
        <p></p>Mahiru still felt distant with his father.
        <p></p>Amane's father noticed Mahiru's slightly stiff demeanor,
        <p></p>and he put on an amiable smile. "Oh, you don't have to be
        <p></p>formal around an old man like me," he said.
        <p></p>"Oh no, I wasn't…"
        <p></p>"The problem is that you don't look like an old man, Dad."
        <p></p>"Oh, what a nice thing to say!"
        <p></p>It was true, Amane's father looked much younger than his
        <p></p>actual age. He had what they called a baby face. Nobody
        <p></p>could have ever guessed he was in his late thirties the first
        <p></p>time they met him.
        <p></p>"You're looking good yourself, Amane."
        <p></p>"Have I changed that much in just six months?"
        <p></p>"Mm-hmm. You look more manly—or like you've gained
        <p></p>some confidence. And you're filling out well."
        <p></p>Since he was traveling with Mahiru that day, Amane had
        <p></p>dressed up. But his father must have meant that Amane had
        <p></p>never been very confident in the past, and now that he was,
        <p></p>it made a big impression.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane felt slightly embarrassed that his dad could see
        <p></p>through him like that. He pressed his lips together, and his
        <p></p>father chuckled quietly.
        <p></p>"Well, Shihoko dear, can I leave it up to you to show them
        <p></p>around? I still have some refreshments to prepare."
        <p></p>"Sure! Come on in, kids. The house isn't much, but make
        <p></p>yourself at home, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"No, not at all… Thank you for your hospitality."
        <p></p>Mahiru bowed sincerely and took off her shoes before
        <p></p>stepping up into the house. Amane also removed his and
        <p></p>wore house slippers.
        <p></p>He didn't need a tour of his own childhood home, but
        <p></p>Amane intended to go along and stand guard so his mother
        <p></p>wouldn't tell Mahiru things he'd prefer she not know.
        <p></p>Shihoko watched Shuuto go back into the dining room,
        <p></p>then beckoned the two of them toward the stairs. "This
        <p></p>way!"
        <p></p>Most of the bedrooms and the guest room were on the
        <p></p>second floor, so it seemed like she was going to show them
        <p></p>that first.
        <p></p>Amane had planned to go to his own room and take a
        <p></p>peek inside the bag he had shipped ahead, but he thought
        <p></p>about it for a second and remembered where the guest room
        <p></p>was. An uneasy expression crossed his face.
        <p></p>…When I looked last year, there was only one other room
        <p></p>that hadn't been turned into storage space.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>That room, with a balcony that connected to his, had
        <p></p>apparently been built to use when his parents had another
        <p></p>child. In the end, the family hadn't been blessed with
        <p></p>another one, so it had gone unused, but the interior had
        <p></p>been finished and set up so people could stay there.
        <p></p>They rarely visited anymore, but when Amane's cousins
        <p></p>had come to spend long holidays with his family, that was
        <p></p>the space they had used.
        <p></p>Not that he and Mahiru were going to do anything, but his
        <p></p>stomach hurt a little as he wondered whether it was okay for
        <p></p>members of the opposite sex to stay in rooms that were so
        <p></p>directly connected.
        <p></p>"All right, Mahiru sweetie, you can use this room."
        <p></p>Just as Amane had suspected, his mother led them into
        <p></p>the room next to his, and he let out a soft sigh.
        <p></p>"Thank you so much for preparing a room for me."
        <p></p>"Don't mention it. The second-floor bathroom is over
        <p></p>there, and the room next to you is Amane's. Sorry, but the
        <p></p>balcony is connected."
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked in surprise when she heard that, then
        <p></p>averted her eyes awkwardly.
        <p></p>"I'll make sure to lock my side of the balcony, and you can
        <p></p>lock yours, too."
        <p></p>"I-I'm not worried about that."
        <p></p>"Just…please do it."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Oh-hoh, how precious." His mother laughed. "Well, I'm
        <p></p>going to help with lunch, so you two check your bags, okay?
        <p></p>We've already carried yours up to your room, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"Thank you so much."
        <p></p>"No problem. All right, see you in a bit."
        <p></p>Amane's mother smiled and went downstairs. He watched
        <p></p>until he couldn't see her back anymore, then let out a huge
        <p></p>sigh.
        <p></p>"Sorry, I think this was the only available room."
        <p></p>"N-no, it's fine!"
        <p></p>"It's fine because we're together, but if we weren't, it
        <p></p>would be awful, right? But I don't think my mom knows
        <p></p>about us… Geez."
        <p></p>"It's really okay. Besides, um… If the veranda connects,
        <p></p>we can look at the stars together," Mahiru said quietly with a
        <p></p>bashful look.
        <p></p>Amane smiled once he realized she wasn't worried about
        <p></p>him visiting her in bed, and when she mentioned spending
        <p></p>time together at night, happiness gradually welled up inside
        <p></p>him.
        <p></p>"…Well, we can meet on the balcony later if we get a
        <p></p>chance. Go ahead and get settled."
        <p></p>"Okay."
        <p></p>He wasn't sure whether Mahiru could tell that he was
        <p></p>trying to hide his embarrassment, but she giggled happily
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>and went into her assigned room.
        <p></p>It hit Amane again that they were going to spend two
        <p></p>weeks together in the same space, and he covered his face
        <p></p>with his hands as he stepped into his own room.
        <p></p>Lunch was like a welcome reception for Mahiru, and
        <p></p>Amane's father treated them to some of his home cooking.
        <p></p>Shuuto was the type of person who, like Mahiru, could
        <p></p>make all sorts of food, and apparently on Shihoko's request,
        <p></p>the day's main dish was paella.
        <p></p>Of course, there wasn't just paella; the table was also set
        <p></p>with bisque and salads loaded with seafood.
        <p></p>Naturally, everything was delicious, and Mahiru was
        <p></p>genuinely delighted. It seemed Shuuto had impressed her
