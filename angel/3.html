        suppose it's a bit of a different story if you're collecting them, but from the way you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        keep them piled up everywhere, I doubt that's the case. If you do want to hold on to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some part of one, tear out the page and put it in a scrapbook, then dispose of the rest.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Tie up any magazines you're getting rid of and put them out for collection."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru set about the task of cleaning right away, directing Amane to put his discarded<p></p>
        <p></p>
        clothing into the laundry basket as she gathered up every last magazine. She told him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to speak now if there were any that Amane wanted to keep, but there weren't any in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        particular that he needed, so he simply shook his head. Having received the answer<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she required, Mahiru skillfully tied up the bundle using some plastic cord that she had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apparently brought with her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "When you're finished gathering the clothes, please go through the other assorted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        clutter and decide whether to throw anything out. All these different things on the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        floor: same as before, sort them into what you need to keep and what you don't. Then<p></p>
        <p></p>
        put the latter in the trash. Got it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Uh-huh," Amane answered meekly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If you have a problem with taking orders, you'd better tell me now."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, I don't, but… I was just thinking about how quick you're doing all of this."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If I don't, we'll run out of time. It's total chaos in here, after all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're right."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even though it was the weekend, time was limited. If they were going to run the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        vacuum, it would have to be during the day, considering that the noise would be a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nuisance to the neighbors. Since Mahiru knew that it would take a lot of effort to get<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the place to a state where they could vacuum, she was working to tidy up as quickly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as possible.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        One part of Amane felt bad for letting her do so much. On the other hand, under<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's direction, more and more of the floor began to appear for the first time in a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        long while.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Professor Shiina…," Amane muttered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If you're going to ask for guidance from me like I'm a teacher, first learn by imitating.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I'm not going to sort through your personal effects, so please be diligent and keep only<p></p>
        <p></p>
        what you really need," Mahiru instructed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yes, sir."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Please don't address me as a man."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The angel nonchalantly returned Amane's jabs as she skillfully cleared up more of the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        clutter with a serious expression the whole time.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had a bad habit of hoarding useless junk, and he was both grateful for Mahiru's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        decisiveness and envious of it. Here she was, in a stranger's apartment, picking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        through the mess without hesitation. She really was the spitting image of an angel.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was so efficient that she could have easily cleaned up the whole place by<p></p>
        <p></p>
        herself had she wanted to. However, likely because she was in such a hurry, she got<p></p>
        <p></p>
        careless about watching her footing. There was no doubt that it was Amane's fault for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        leaving it on the floor, but Mahiru slipped on a piece of discarded clothing and lost her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        balance.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The instant a small "Ah!" escaped Mahiru's mouth, Amane dived across the room,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        aiming for the spot where he thought Mahiru would most likely fall.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A light, sweet fragrance mixed with the musty smell of the dust that had been kicked<p></p>
        <p></p>
        up in the panic.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane landed on his backside, leaving his rear end to suffer a dull sting, but it was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tolerable. He groaned just a bit as he felt the weight of Mahiru pressing down on him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She must be happy that I caught her right away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Fujimiya?" Mahiru looked up at him. She didn't seem angry, but she didn't seem<p></p>
        <p></p>
        particularly happy about the situation, either. Mostly, she just sounded surprised. "I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        can accept the blame for falling, but this is exactly why you must tidy up, because<p></p>
        <p></p>
        otherwise things like this are bound to happen."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm really sorry, honestly… You're not hurt, are you?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm fine. Thanks for going out of your way to catch me. I'm sorry, too."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, it's all my fault…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wouldn't have been able to bear it if Mahiru had gotten hurt while helping him,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        especially considering she was already sharing meals with him. That would've been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        absolutely unforgivable; he wouldn't have even been able to look her in the eye.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If he needed to, he was considering kneeling and asking for forgiveness, but Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        didn't seem too upset over her tumble.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "We're cleaning up so that things like this don't happen anymore, understand?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah. I'm really very sorry."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's fine; you don't need to apologize. I'm helping you because I feel like it, after all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru looked just a little bit flustered as she gazed up at Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane suddenly realized how close they were and was aware of her pressing against<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him. For a boy who basically never interacted with girls on a regular basis, this was a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        heart-pounding situation. Even though neither of them had any romantic feelings for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the other, something felt very wrong about it somehow.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru didn't seem to be conscious of the situation, so Amane gently grabbed her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shoulder and pushed her off of him; then he stood up before the awkwardness could<p></p>
        <p></p>
        show on his face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Should we… keep cleaning?" he managed after a moment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yes, that's a good idea," Mahiru replied. Fortunately for Amane, she appeared to be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        oblivious to his trembling as she grabbed the hand Amane extended and rose to her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        feet.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru seemed unaware of how closely she'd been pressed up against him, because<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she just maintained her usual expression. Amane figured that a girl like Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        must've been used to the attention of a lot of boys. Surely a little contact like that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wouldn't be enough to unnerve her like it did him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Smiling wryly at Mahiru's demeanor, Amane decided it would be wrong to leave<p></p>
        <p></p>
        everything up to her and returned to cleaning with newfound resolve. Even though<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the task was wholly unfamiliar, he did his best to struggle through.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You are full of surprises."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was too focused on his work to notice the quiet words that escaped Mahiru's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        lips, nor did he see that her ears, hidden by her straw-colored hair, had turned slightly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        red.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Whew, now, this is clean."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In the end, it had taken the pair the entire day to clean Amane's apartment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Several hours were spent tidying up the clutter on his floor, and then, between<p></p>
        <p></p>
        washing the clothes, dusting the shelves and light fixtures, scrubbing the windows,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and vacuuming, the entire day had flown by before they knew it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The sun had been visible when Mahiru came over, but it had long since set by now,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        proof of just how long she and Amane had been working.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It had certainly been no small task, but those efforts were not without results. Amane's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apartment was so clean that he barely recognized it. There was no unnecessary clutter,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and he could see the floor! Once-dirty windowpanes and frames didn't have a single<p></p>
        <p></p>
        speck of dirt on them. The lights, too, shone brighter now that they had been dusted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The place was finally clean. Without all the junk crowding every surface, it actually<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looked to be quite a comfortable space.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "To think that it took us a whole day," Mahiru observed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Guess that's what it takes when it's such a mess…," Amane answered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But it was your mess."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "R-right you are."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane verbally prostrated himself before his angelic savior, who had taken mercy on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him. Mahiru, who had wasted one of her precious weekend days helping him, finished<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tying up a garbage bag with a beleaguered look. She didn't seem upset, but a hint of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fatigue showed on her face, though it was mixed with a sense of accomplishment. That<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was only natural, since she had been working all day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After everything that had transpired, Amane would have been ashamed to simply let<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru go make dinner. It'd be unforgivable to expect her to do any more work,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        whether she shared a portion of her cooking with him today or not.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Now that it's evening, I don't feel like going shopping, so I'm going to order a pizza or<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something. Please let me treat you today. After all, you've been giving me all kinds of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        food and stuff," Amane offered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, but—," Mahiru started, but she was quickly cut off.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If you don't want to eat with me, I'll order one for you, and you can take it home."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        This gesture was more about showing gratitude than trying to get Mahiru to eat with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him, so if she wanted to eat alone, Amane didn't mind.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…That's not what I meant. It's just… I was surprised, because I've never ordered<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pizza."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh, you've never ordered pizza?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, I live alone, but I've never ordered pizza… I've made it myself, though."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's amazing that you would even think to make it," Amane exclaimed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Normally, if someone decided they wanted pizza, the three options were to buy a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ready-made one at the store, get it delivered, or go eat it in a restaurant. He was sure<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that there were very few people who would think to go through the long, laborious<p></p>
        <p></p>
        process of making one from scratch.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, there's nothing strange about ordering pizza for delivery," Amane asserted. "I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        do it all the time myself: order delivery or go to a family restaurant solo… you know,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like most people."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I've actually never been to one of those, either," Mahiru admitted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Now, that is rare. I go alone pretty often, and my parents go to restaurants whenever<p></p>
        <p></p>
        they don't feel like cooking. I guess your parents aren't the type to eat out often, huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…In our house, the help made the meals."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "The help? Damn, you must be really rich."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Finding out that Mahiru was fabulously wealthy explained a lot. It certainly cleared up<p></p>
        <p></p>
        why Mahiru's mannerisms were so graceful and refined—and why her clothes and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        possessions were always top quality. Even the girl's gait seemed to speak of an affluent<p></p>
        <p></p>
        upbringing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At Amane's words, Mahiru broke into a thin smile. "You're right; I think I am<p></p>
        <p></p>
        comparatively well-off."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Quickly, Amane began to regret what he'd said, realizing that Mahiru's smile was not<p></p>
        <p></p>
        one of delight or pride but rather a display of self-mockery. It seemed that her family<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was an area of discussion that was better left alone, and Amane didn't plan to pry any<p></p>
        <p></p>
        further.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Everybody has a thing or two they'd rather not talk about. It's only polite to respect that,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        especially with people you don't know very well.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, then this will be an interesting experience, won't it? Here, order what you like."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Dropping the topic of Mahiru's parents, Amane showed her a menu for a pizza place<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane occasionally ordered from. Out of all the places that delivered, it was the best.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Their pizza was no match for one cooked in an authentic wood-fired oven, of course,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but they did offer a wide variety of toppings. Their choices ranged from the standard<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fare to stuff more suited to little kids, so Amane figured that there was sure to be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something that would appeal to Mahiru's tastes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru accepted both the change of subject and the pizza menu. She immediately<p></p>
        <p></p>
        began poring over the list of options, her luminous brown eyes drawn to the many<p></p>
        <p></p>
        colorful photos of different pizzas. Her eyes weren't usually very expressive, but now<p></p>
        <p></p>
        they shimmered vividly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She must really be looking forward to this, Amane thought.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru seemed a bit nervous, but after considering it for a little while, she pointed out<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a party pizza with four types of toppings and said hesitantly, "All right, this looks good."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She turned an expectant gaze to Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With a slight smile, Amane nodded, picked up his phone, and dialed the number<p></p>
        <p></p>
        printed on the menu. Mahiru's eyes sparkled with anticipation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        An hour later, their pizza arrived. Mahiru dug in without hesitation. The pizza was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        divided into sections to allow the different flavors to be sampled on their own, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she'd hesitated a little over which one to try first but finally decided to start with a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        piece covered with a hearty helping of bacon and sausage.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was not surprised when Mahiru nibbled at her slice with small, delicate bites.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He supposed her refined upbringing had taught her to eat everything with poise and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        grace, even delivery pizza.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Watching Mahiru gave Amane a warm feeling inside, like he was watching a small, cute<p></p>
        <p></p>
        animal. She was strangely adorable as her eyes closed and her expression relaxed a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        little while she chewed on the stretchy cheese. Usually, the girl appeared so mature; in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        this moment, however, she finally looked her age.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane quelled an intense urge to pat Mahiru's head as she enjoyed the pizza with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        little, mincing bites.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…What?" she asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nothing, you just look like you're enjoying it," Amane replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Please don't stare at me so much."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The frown she cast at Amane was anything but cute, however.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Geez, you've really got no charm."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, that suits me fine. If I were to act like I always do at school, you'd say I was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        making you uncomfortable."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, I guess that's true. I'm more familiar with this version of you than the school<p></p>
        <p></p>
        version."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At school, Amane barely ever even saw Mahiru, and they had certainly never spoken<p></p>
        <p></p>
        there. He only occasionally caught a glimpse of her, and she always wore that same,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        impenetrable smile that she showed to everyone.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Here, he got to see beyond that layer. This has to be the real Mahiru, Amane thought.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At school, she always adopted her fake, public persona.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "As far as I'm concerned," he continued, "I never get tired of this version."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "The version with no charm?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't hold a grudge… You know, how do I put this…? I can never tell what you're<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thinking when you're at school."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mostly about my schedule and my classes, I suppose."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So even you can be clueless once in a while, huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had meant to say that Mahiru always looked like she had some secret on her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mind, but Mahiru apparently took his words at face value. She looked at him with a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        subtle protest in her eyes, as though she had meant something else entirely.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I, uh, didn't mean it like that," Amane quickly added. "It's just… You don't show what<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you're thinking. All I meant was that it's easier to be around someone who's honest<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about their feelings, even if they're a little rude, than someone who you can never<p></p>
        <p></p>
        read."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Do you think how I behave at school is bad?" Mahiru asked directly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I can't really hate on it, since it's probably the secret to your success. I just<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wonder if you ever get tired of it," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Not really. I've been acting like that since I was little."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hard-core, huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If she'd been keeping up this act since childhood, spending her whole life trying to be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the perfect young woman everyone expected her to be, Amane could understand how<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it would definitely be difficult for her to set that persona aside.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had been able to infer a little bit about Mahiru's home life, but he knew that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        there was no way he could ask her more about it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, isn't it nice to have a place where you can relax? And now you've even got a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        buddy to chill with."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Honestly, I don't find you relaxing at all. You make my stomach turn in knots," Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stated coldly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm… sorry?" Amane apologized, a little dumbstruck.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru gave an exaggerated shrug and let out a strange little laugh.<p></p>
        <p></p>

        6 A Visit from a Friend<p></p>
        After the day-long cleanup, Amane felt like the wall between Mahiru and him had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        become ever-so-slightly thinner, but that didn't necessarily mean they had become<p></p>
        <p></p>
        much closer.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They still had absolutely zero contact at school; they would make small talk sometimes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        when he went to get his portion of dinner from her, but that was all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Just the other day, Mahiru had scolded Amane, telling him that he had to keep his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apartment tidy. Her words were definitely stern, but they also made it clear that she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        actually did care about him, at least a bit.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Since Amane was receiving frequent reminders and tips on cleaning, his apartment<p></p>
        <p></p>
        remained as nice as it had been when he and Mahiru had finished tidying up the place.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Wow, it really is clean." That was the first thing Itsuki said when he came over on a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        day off. He muttered in an astonished voice when he saw the drastic transformation<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the living room had undergone.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I never thought your place could look this good. It was so dirty. I remember I helped<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you pick up stuff once before, but it was a wreck the very next day."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Give it a rest," Amane shot back at his friend.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, but seriously, think about it. What's the longest number of days you've gone<p></p>
        <p></p>
        without dropping something on your floor?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "This is easily a new record. I've kept it going for two weeks."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Two weeks?! That's it? That's nothing to be proud of, you know?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane scowled a little. He was now keenly aware that normally, people did not leave<p></p>
        <p></p>
        their things lying around on the floor. Still, he knew that Itsuki was only speaking from<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a place of kindness and common sense, so Amane couldn't say much. After all, Itsuki<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had helped him out, too, long before Mahiru ever had, so Amane knew he shouldn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        act like a jerk.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki smiled cheerfully at Amane's sullen silence. "Hey, I guess if your apartment's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        this clean, I could even bring Chi over."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No way; why should I have to watch you two flirting in my own home?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No need to be shy, buddy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't turn my place into your hangout!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Why should I have to watch my friend and his girlfriend getting all lovey-dovey?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wished Itsuki could understand his position and appreciate what kind of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        torture it was like to have to watch a sickeningly sweet couple flirting all the time. He<p></p>
        <p></p>
        knew that Itsuki was just joking about bringing Chi over, but even so, Amane didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        find it very amusing that he constantly had front-row seats to their cloying relationship.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Relax, it was just a joke. Anyway, now that you've finally got the place clean, don't go<p></p>
        <p></p>
        messing it up again, you hear?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I've got it under control," Amane assured.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Someone like you… Well, whatever. Just make sure you get in the habit of putting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        things away after you take them out."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Are you my mom…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Now, Amane, dearie, you have to be diligent about cleaning your room!" Itsuki mocked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's so creepy; you sound so much like my mom, it's scary!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane felt a shiver rocket down his back when Itsuki scolded him in a forced falsetto.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was sure Itsuki had never even met his mother, but still, the impression had hit a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nerve. Itsuki's impersonation of a lady wasn't particularly soothing, either. Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stuck out his tongue at him, and Itsuki cackled with amusement.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is that what your mom's like, Amane? Because mine is really cold toward me…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Actually, I'm jealous. My mom bugs me whenever she gets the chance."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "She sounds like a mom who really cares about her son."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I think she's just overly attached…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, I'm sure she has to look after you because you're such a slob."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, shut up. I mean it, you know, that my mom is too clingy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Perhaps because Amane was an only child, his mother was always fussing over him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She didn't exactly spoil him, but she did poke her nose around in his business and read<p></p>
        <p></p>
        too much into things. Amane certainly didn't hate her, but she made him uncomfortable<p></p>
        <p></p>
        at times.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His mother had given him all sorts of instructions when he'd left home to live on his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        own and attend high school, and sometimes she would show up to check on him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        without warning. The pop-ins could be pretty awful.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, doesn't that just show how much she treasures you, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And her love is a heavy burden."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, I give up. You're the kind of guy who never appreciates what he's got till it's gone."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You talk like you've got it all figured out, but don't you have your own problems<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dealing with that kind of meddling?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ha-ha! It's Chi, man; what else can I do?" Itsuki had all sorts of issues when it came<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to his father and his girlfriend, so his lecture really didn't have much weight behind it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even so, Amane knew there was some truth to what his friend was saying, so he didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        argue any further.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki sighed quietly, as if to tell Amane to let him worry about his own problems. His<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expression remained cheerful and carefree, however. "I'll mess up anybody who<p></p>
        <p></p>
        interferes with me and Chi!" Itsuki said, declaring something a little unsettling.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Anyway, I'll figure out something for my dad situation, so it's all good. For the time<p></p>
        <p></p>
        being, how 'bout you sort your life out, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki laughed loudly, and Amane responded by making a sour face. "I know that; you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        don't have to tell me." He smiled secretly to himself, however, thinking how he'd heard<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that before from another person recently.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki had come to visit Amane's apartment in order to see how he was living. Well,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        actually, he'd mostly come to hang out and mess around, so their discussion about the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        state of the room quickly wrapped up, and before long, they were playing a video<p></p>
        <p></p>
        game. Their initial intention had been to study for a test the next week, but that notion<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had been quickly discarded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Careful with the health packs; we're gonna run out," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "We'll think of something; it'll be fine," Itsuki answered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Not at this level it won't…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Amane pondered how best to deal with his less cautious co-op player, the sound of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the doorbell rang through the room and immediately gave rise to a different worry.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm? A visitor?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki looked up, too, after pausing the game. He knew that Amane had never really<p></p>
        <p></p>
        told anyone else where he lived, and that he didn't have any friends who might visit<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him at home, besides Itsuki himself. More importantly, any regular visitor would have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been stopped at the lobby downstairs anyway, so a page should have come through<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the intercom.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't really know, but it must be a neighbor, right? Distributing a community notice<p></p>
        <p></p>
        or something," Amane fibbed, knowing quite well who it likely was.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, gotcha," Itsuki answered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'll just be a minute."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane did his best to dispel Itsuki's suspicions and hurried toward the front door,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        struggling to hide the twitch in his face that might give him away. He was lucky that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru hadn't called out to him after ringing the buzzer.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He opened the door quickly, not bothering to check who it was, and slipped through<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the small opening to get outside where he couldn't be seen. Amane made sure to close<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the door behind himself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Just as he'd suspected, it was Mahiru standing there, blinking in surprise at Amane,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        who must have appeared to have been acting very unusual.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Immediately, he pressed an index finger to his lips and shushed Mahiru. "…Please<p></p>
        <p></p>
        speak softly. Itsuki is here."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Itsuki?" she asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "My friend. He came over to play games."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, okay."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru nodded in understanding of Amane's secretive behavior, then passed him a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        food container as she did every day without bothering to question him any further.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Inside was a type of stew called oden, the perfect dish for the season now that the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        weather had gotten cold. Mahiru had probably been preparing it since morning. Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        accepted it with gratitude and let out a soft sigh as he looked at Mahiru. There was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        really no reason she ought to be doing this every day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Look, I really appreciate what you do, but… I don't have a lot of time. Sorry," Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apologized.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I wasn't waiting to be thanked or anything… I'm glad, you know, that we cleaned up<p></p>
        <p></p>
        enough that you can invite friends over," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I guess I should kneel down and thank you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No way; don't do that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru looked at him with astonishment in her eyes. Perhaps she thought getting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane to do something like that would make her akin to a tyrant. Amane smiled wryly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There had been a bit of earnestness in his statement, because he truly was indebted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to her. She'd done so much for him that he really ought to be on his knees. Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        couldn't reconcile continuing to accept all the food for free, so he decided that he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wanted to discuss paying her for the meals at some later date.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, if your friend is here, I suppose you can't talk for too long. Excuse me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You're always helping me out. I'll make sure to keep this secret from Itsuki."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Please do."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, even if I told him everything, he probably won't believe me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I suppose not."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's honest confirmation raised some complex feelings for Amane, but he knew<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she was right. If he was in Itsuki's shoes and someone told him that Mahiru Shiina had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been making meals for him daily, he definitely wouldn't believe them. Anyone would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dismiss such a claim as a fantasy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That was how out of reach this angel was.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Normally, it would be impossible to imagine Mahiru treating even a handsome,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        superior man to her home cooking, let alone a mediocre and slovenly guy like Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Hell would sooner freeze over.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Can I ask you one thing?" Amane called.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What is it?" Mahiru stopped before entering her apartment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What good does it do you to keep sharing your meals with me?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Typically, people didn't give away food for free—they expected something in return.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane probably wouldn't have thought about doing the same for Mahiru if their<p></p>
        <p></p>
        positions had been reversed. Even though he didn't believe for a moment that there<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was even the slightest possibility that she had feelings for him, he couldn't help but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wonder.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At Amane's question, Mahiru gaze wandered upward as if she was giving it a bit of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thought herself, then, without any change to her expression, answered, "My own
        <p></p>
        self-satisfaction. There's nothing more to it. It's just as easy for me to cook for two people<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as it is for one, and I guess I simply like treating people."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So it's because you like to cook?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, there's that, too. I think it's also because I can give you food without you getting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        any weird ideas, and you'll genuinely tell me that my cooking's tasty without any<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ulterior motives. Plus, it's satisfying for me because I was concerned after seeing your<p></p>
        <p></p>
        eating habits."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Is that how it is?" Amane pressed, just the slightest bit disappointed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's how it is. So don't worry about it. Just think of it as… a sudden bout of good<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fortune."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yes, ma'am."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru didn't seem like she was going to give him any more of an answer than that,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and after bowing courteously, she said "Pardon me" and returned to her own apartment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I guess that's how it goes," Amane mumbled to himself. "I still don't think it's right for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her to give it to me for free, though." He opened the door back into his own place.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Who was it?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "My neighbor. She gave me some of her dinner. I'm gonna put it in the fridge, so don't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        restart the game without me," Amane replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, sorry, I already beat the boss."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You gotta be kidding me."<p></p>
        <p></p>

        7 The Angel’s Injury and a Show of Gratitude<p></p>
        Every day on his way home, Amane passed the park where he and Mahiru had properly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        met for the first time.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The building where Amane lived was less of a family-use apartment complex and more<p></p>
        <p></p>
        aimed at single people and couples, so there were few children around, and the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        surrounding apartment buildings were much the same.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Tucked away and out of sight, the little park close to Amane's building was often<p></p>
        <p></p>
        deserted. It was in that little park devoid of children, Amane saw Mahiru for the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        second time.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What are you doing in a place like this?" he asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Nothing." Mahiru was sitting on a bench with straight posture and didn't budge at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        all even after she recognized Amane and looked him over.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In contrast to the first time the two had met there, this time they were already<p></p>
        <p></p>
        acquainted and were on speaking terms. That had made it easier for Amane to call to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru, but the girl's voice had still been stiff when she answered. It didn't seem like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was on guard, as she had been during their first encounter. This was something<p></p>
        <p></p>
        different. Amane could tell that Mahiru was being careful not to let something show<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on her face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come on, if it was nothing, you wouldn't be sitting here making that face. Did<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something happen?" Amane inquired.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Not really…" Mahiru looked, as she had before when she was on the swing in the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        rainstorm, like she was lost and didn't know what to do. Seeing her like that worried<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane, but Mahiru didn't seem keen to speak on the matter.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Though he was bound by their tacit promise not to interact outside their apartments,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane hadn't been able to help calling out to Mahiru when he'd seen her all alone in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the park again. Mahiru, for her part, probably did not much want to talk to him; her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expression was stiff and blank.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane thought it was fine if the girl wasn't feeling up to talking, when he noticed that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        there were a number of white hairs stuck to her blazer. "You have some hair stuck to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        your uniform; were you playing with a dog or a cat?" he asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I wasn't playing. I just helped a cat that was stranded up a tree get back down," Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What a total cliche … Ah, I get it now."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Wait right there. Don't you dare move."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had finally realized just why Mahiru was sitting there alone on the bench. He<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sighed and dashed off. He was certain that Mahiru would do as he had asked and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would not go anywhere. Actually, it would have been more appropriate to say that she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        couldn't go anywhere.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Muttering to himself about how Mahiru chose the strangest times to act tough, Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bought a compress and medical tape from the neighborhood drugstore, along with a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cup of ice normally used for iced coffee from a convenience store. When Amane at last<p></p>
        <p></p>
        returned to the park, he found Mahiru sitting on the bench, just as he'd expected. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hadn't so much as shifted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shiina, take off your tights."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He gave a direct order, and she answered in an extremely cold voice.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, I know it's kind of sudden… Look, I'll put my blazer over you and turn around,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so take the tights off. We need to ice the injury and put a compress on it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As expected, Mahiru was none too happy at being ordered to take off her tights, so by<p></p>
        <p></p>
        way of explanation, Amane waved the bag full of medical supplies.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's face understandably tightened. "…How did you know?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You had one of your loafers off, and that ankle seemed slightly swollen. Plus, you didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        try to stand up. It really is a total cliche to sprain your ankle while rescuing a cat."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, be quiet."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, yeah. Now, take off your tights and give me your foot."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was something anyone would have known just from looking, but Mahiru was making<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a sour face, perhaps because she hadn't expected him to notice that she was hurt.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Obediently, Mahiru accepted Amane's blazer and put it over her knees, so it seemed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like she was going to listen to what he was saying.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane turned his back to Mahiru, put the ice from the cup he had bought at the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        convenience store into a plastic bag, and poured water over it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After he tied the top shut so it wouldn't spill out, he wrapped it loosely in a hand towel<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that he kept in his backpack, making an impromptu ice pack. Then he turned around<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slowly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had done as he had asked and removed her tights, exposing her bare legs. They<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were slender and smooth—and looked soft even as she tensed up. The unnatural<p></p>
        <p></p>
        swelling around her ankle was evident.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, it's not that badly swollen, but it could get worse if you move it too much. First<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of all, this is going to be cold, but let's ice it for a bit. Once the pain goes away a little,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I'll put a compress on, so take it easy," Amane explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Thank you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "From now on, just ask for my help. It's not like you'll owe me or anything."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If anything, it's the opposite—I want to pay you back in some small way for everything<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you've done for me, so I'd appreciate if you would let me solve one or two problems for you.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru sported her usual expression. Still, she didn't argue with Amane and quietly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        let him ice her ankle while her leg was propped up on the bench.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Has the pain gotten any better?" Amane asked after a moment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Yeah, a bit," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, I'm putting the compress on, so… don't get mad at me for being a perv or a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        groper or something, okay?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I wouldn't say something so rude to the person helping me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Good to hear."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Stressing that he had absolutely no untoward thoughts, Amane squatted down next to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's leg and stuck a compress on her swollen, red ankle.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Amane initially asked about the level of pain, it sounded like the sort of thing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        where Mahiru could still stand and walk, but moving risked agitating the sprain<p></p>
        <p></p>
        further, so she was better off sitting here quietly. As long as she stayed off it, it would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        probably remain a minor injury.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had just finished sticking on the compress and was securing it with medical<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tape when he noticed Mahiru staring intently down at him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're surprisingly skillful with that," she commented.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I can do first aid. Still can't cook, though." Amane shrugged, acting a little silly,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and Mahiru let out a small laugh. He was glad to see her taut expression relax some,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        even if it was only a tiny bit. Reassured by Mahiru's slightly softened attitude, Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pulled the pants of his gym uniform from his backpack.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Here," he said, handing them to Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What?" she asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't make that face at me; I don't like it. Anyway, your legs are exposed, right? And<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it's not like you can put your tights back on with the compress stuck to you. Relax, I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        haven't worn them."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It would be bad to let her put her tights back on over her swollen ankle, especially now<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that it had medical tape wrapped around it. Since it looked so painful, Amane figured<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru could wear his gym pants, both as protection from the cold and to stop anyone<p></p>
        <p></p>
        from seeing her underwear.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to understand that he was just trying to be considerate, and so she<p></p>
