        <p></p>to…to coax me into anything, but…"
        <p></p>Mahiru was mumbling in a tearful voice, with an
        <p></p>expression that was shy and apologetic.
        <p></p>Unable to bear it any longer, Amane buried his face in her
        <p></p>collar.
        <p></p>"…I can't take this anymore."
        <p></p>His quiet whisper seemed to have reached Mahiru's ears,
        <p></p>since she was trembling uneasily. He didn't want her to
        <p></p>misunderstand, so he peered into her teary eyes and
        <p></p>continued.
        <p></p>"Here's the thing, Mahiru. When you say stuff like that,
        <p></p>it's hard for me to resist. But if we go forward, I'm never
        <p></p>going to want to go back."
        <p></p>Hoping that hearing his plea would do her some good,
        <p></p>Amane squeezed her in a tight embrace as he mumbled his
        <p></p>objections.
        <p></p>"I think you ought to value yourself a little more, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"I—I do, but we're in love, so I want you to do as you
        <p></p>please."
        <p></p>"Please stop with the suggestive statements. You shouldn't
        <p></p>test a man's restraint."
        <p></p>"Test…?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…If you understand how much I love you, like you say,
        <p></p>then you're being a terrible temptress."
        <p></p>Amane did consider she might be stirring him up on
        <p></p>purpose, knowing he absolutely wouldn't make a move, but
        <p></p>he concluded there was no way that innocent Mahiru would
        <p></p>do such a shrewd thing. In other words, she was seducing 7
        <p></p>him without even knowing she was doing it. That was the
        <p></p>scariest thing about it.
        <p></p>Maybe because she sensed Amane's face pucker as he
        <p></p>tried to resist temptation, Mahiru's cheeks flushed slightly
        <p></p>as she looked up at him with a sweet gaze.
        <p></p>"…I trust you; you know?"
        <p></p>"I feel like my trust is being held hostage."
        <p></p>"Th-that wasn't my intention, though. I see that you're
        <p></p>conflicted, and somehow…that makes me happy. Wait, I—I
        <p></p>don't mean that I'm enjoying this or anything, okay? But the
        <p></p>idea that you treasure me so much, well, I can really tell, and
        <p></p>it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy—and so loved…"
        <p></p>In spite of himself, Amane looked at Mahiru after she
        <p></p>whispered these heartfelt words and received a fleeting,
        <p></p>bashful look in return.
        <p></p>"In the past, I learned all sorts of things from the
        <p></p>housekeeper, Miss Koyuki, so I know that people like you are
        <p></p>incredibly rare, Amane. People who listen to the feelings of 1
        <p></p>others and respect them. I know that you respect me—and
        <p></p>that you treasure me. That's exactly why you gave me the
        <p></p>right to choose earlier."
        <p></p>It was precisely because he treasured her that he didn't
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>want to do anything that would clash with Mahiru's feelings
        <p></p>—this sentiment of Amane's had indeed been conveyed to
        <p></p>her, and it was with that understanding that Mahiru was
        <p></p>begging him to act on his desires.
        <p></p>Amane was speechless as Mahiru looked up at him
        <p></p>timidly once again.
        <p></p>"From the bottom of my heart, I'm so glad I fell in love
        <p></p>with a guy like you."
        <p></p>Seeing Mahiru wearing a smile packed full of joy,
        <p></p>happiness, and love, Amane reached his limit—he pressed
        <p></p>his lips against her tender, soft, pale cheek. 8
        <p></p>Her cheek was incomparably smooth compared to his
        <p></p>own skin, and he gave her the tenderest of light kisses,
        <p></p>putting all his love into it. Starting from the spot he had
        <p></p>kissed, her pale skin flushed pink.
        <p></p>"All right, there… I kissed your cheek; was that okay?" 1
        <p></p>He had followed through, but now he was worried that it
        <p></p>would have been better to warn her before he did…
        <p></p>Although, it was already too late for that.
        <p></p>An amused, happy smile blossomed across Mahiru's face.
        <p></p>"…I feel like that's not something you need to ask after
        <p></p>you've already gotten permission."
        <p></p>"I couldn't help it… I just—my self-control was at its limit,
        <p></p>you could say. Sorry for indulging myself."
        <p></p>"You really are a conscientious person. Of all the things
        <p></p>you could do to me, the only ones I would hate are… Well, I
        <p></p>wouldn't like being tickled or having my cheeks pinched, but
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>really, there's nothing else, okay?" 2
        <p></p>Then Mahiru gently brought her lips to Amane's cheek in
        <p></p>retaliation. After kissing him, she moved them close to his
        <p></p>ear as he sat there, frozen.
        <p></p>"Listen, I'm never going to object to getting a kiss from
        <p></p>my boyfriend."
        <p></p>Oh my god…!
        <p></p>Agonizing over what a bad boyfriend he had been, to be
        <p></p>blind to that obvious fact, Amane planted another gentle kiss
        <p></p>on Mahiru's porcelain cheek.
        <p></p>He forced himself to get ahold of the desires that were
        <p></p>swirling around inside of him, and he embraced Mahiru's
        <p></p>small body again, simply appreciating how lovable his
        <p></p>girlfriend was.
        <p></p>"So stop me if I get crazy, please. This is already a lot…"
        <p></p>"Crazy?"
        <p></p>"I feel like I might lose control, you know? I've got no
        <p></p>willpower to spare. I know that's pretty pathetic, but…"
        <p></p>"…And if you did go wild, what would happen?"
        <p></p>"I'd probably make you cry."
        <p></p>He wasn't going to force her into anything, and he
        <p></p>obviously didn't want to make her cry, but Amane felt like
        <p></p>there was something inside him that he couldn't control. 4
        <p></p>Embracing her, and feeling her soft body against his, filled
        <p></p>him with urges that were hard to resist. The very fact that he
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>had endured it thus far was practically a miracle.
        <p></p>He suspected Mahiru might not stop him if he kept going,
        <p></p>but it was precisely because of how much he cared for her
        <p></p>and wanted to treasure her that he couldn't allow himself to
        <p></p>take things any further.
        <p></p>Instead, in order to rein in his hopeless urges, he loosened
        <p></p>his hold on her just a little.
        <p></p>Amane caught a whiff of her sweet scent, which somehow
        <p></p>seemed even stronger than it had been before, as he slowly
        <p></p>pressed his lips against her neck.
        <p></p>His touch was light on her slender neck, which was so
        <p></p>pale that the blood vessels showed through, and her slim
        <p></p>body shivered. But she didn't seem to dislike it. She just
        <p></p>twisted a little bit as if it tickled.
        <p></p>Slowly, he slid his mouth down, and when he reached the
        <p></p>base of her neck, Amane filled his nose with her scent and
        <p></p>bit down gently.
        <p></p>Of course, he didn't bite hard enough to leave behind 2
        <p></p>tooth impressions. Though it was a light nibble, Mahiru
        <p></p>made a high-pitched noise. But she didn't try to escape from
        <p></p>his arms. She gripped Amane's shirt tightly and let him do as
        <p></p>he pleased.
        <p></p>Her irresistible sweetness threatened to overwhelm him
        <p></p>again, but he kept ahold of himself, and finally, in a spot that
        <p></p>he figured would be covered by her school uniform, he
        <p></p>gently sucked on her skin. 3
        <p></p>Staring at the single dot of rosy color on her otherwise
        <p></p>pale white skin, Amane felt guilt, affection, excitement, and
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>a faint sense of dominance and conquest. When he was
        <p></p>done, he was left with the keen feeling that he was a
        <p></p>despicable man.
        <p></p>He slowly looked up and saw Mahiru staring at him with
        <p></p>teary eyes and a bright-red face. There wasn't the slightest
        <p></p>bit of hatred in her gaze, but her expression was filled with
        <p></p>embarrassment.
        <p></p>Amane immediately knew that he had overdone it, and he
        <p></p>hung his head. "Um… I'm really sorry about that. That 1
        <p></p>wasn't right."
        <p></p>Mahiru opened her tightly pursed lips and, without
        <p></p>hesitation, bit down suddenly on the base of his neck near
        <p></p>his shoulders, just above the collar of his T-shirt.
        <p></p>He could almost hear the adorable sound effects as she
        <p></p>chomped down, then kept nibbling as she tried and failed to
        <p></p>suck at his skin with her mouth. From the way she was
        <p></p>moving, it was more like she was trying to eat him. 7
        <p></p>After a moment, Mahiru pulled her mouth away. She
        <p></p>made a face as if she didn't understand why she had failed to
        <p></p>leave even the faintest impression on Amane's skin. She
        <p></p>must have felt his eyes on her and looked up at him with an
        <p></p>expression that was somewhat sulky and childish, yet also
        <p></p>daring.
        <p></p>"…Fair's fair."
        <p></p>The tone of her voice challenged him to complain. Along
        <p></p>with the fact that she hadn't even been able to leave a mark,
        <p></p>it was so adorable Amane thought he might die. 1
        <p></p>Though he was filled with a desire to hug her tightly and
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>carry her right off to bed, Amane somehow managed to hold
        <p></p>back. "You dummy," he groaned as he buried his face in the
        <p></p>base of her neck again, careful not to start sucking on a new 4
        <p></p>spot. 1

        <p></p>Chapter 62: The Start of Summer Vacation
        <p></p>"Hyah-ha! Our summer vacation is finally heeere!"
        <p></p>"Why are you going wild?"
        <p></p>It was late July. With the closing ceremony finished and
        <p></p>the end of homeroom, the students were finally free. They
        <p></p>excitedly set about discussing their summer plans.
        <p></p>Itsuki had been wound up ever since the moment they
        <p></p>were dismissed, while Amane looked on, sweltering in the
        <p></p>heat.
        <p></p>"Why? Isn't it obvious? Today marks the end of those
        <p></p>hellish classes. Heaven… Paradise has come at last…!"
        <p></p>"Just because you don't like studying doesn't mean that
        <p></p>everybody else hates it."
        <p></p>"Zip it, brainiac. And anyway, you'll have more time to
        <p></p>make out with Mahiru, you know?"
        <p></p>"Make out… Listen, man, it's not like we're on each other
        <p></p>twenty-four seven."
        <p></p>Rather, they spent most of their time doing their own
        <p></p>thing, not even talking to one another.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>When they were spending time together in the same
        <p></p>space, someone was either studying or doing their chores;
        <p></p>they weren't just flirting. 1
        <p></p>Mahiru, of course, had her schoolwork, and in addition,
        <p></p>she exercised for her health and beauty—and took care of 2
        <p></p>her appearance. While she did that, Amane would go
        <p></p>running or do his weight training, so the assumption that
        <p></p>they were always joined at the hip was completely wrong.
        <p></p>"…If I'm being honest, it seems you've got a mental block
        <p></p>against flirting, so you do it unconsciously," Itsuki said.
        <p></p>"How so?"
        <p></p>"I bet you make eye contact and smile from time to time,
        <p></p>and lean against each other, and hold hands…"
        <p></p>Amane couldn't deny that.
        <p></p>He and Mahiru didn't embrace all that often, but smaller
        <p></p>forms of physical affection were a part of their daily routine.
        <p></p>It was hard to know whether that was considered flirting,
        <p></p>exactly, so Amane hadn't counted that, but apparently it did.
        <p></p>"Look here. You two are so flirtatious, I get hot just 4
        <p></p>looking at you. Right, Yuuta?"
        <p></p>"Ah-ha-ha, that's right. How can I put it? I get
        <p></p>embarrassed just watching you guys."
        <p></p>"You too, Kadowaki?"
        <p></p>"But you know, thanks to the PDA, very few people are
        <p></p>going to try to bother you, so I wouldn't say it's all bad."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Sure enough, there had been less harassment and fewer
        <p></p>complaints than Amane had assumed were in store for him,
        <p></p>and at least in their grade, none of the other boys seemed
        <p></p>like they were going to try to make a move to win over
        <p></p>Mahiru.
        <p></p>A big part of that was probably due to the way she acted,
        <p></p>how Mahiru didn't even try to hide the fact that she loved
        <p></p>Amane. She didn't so much as look at any other boys, so they
        <p></p>seemed to have mostly given up on her.
        <p></p>Even so, Amane had prepared himself for criticism and
        <p></p>bullying, but instead, many of his classmates seemed almost
        <p></p>protective. Frankly, Amane couldn't figure out why.
        <p></p>"You know, I bet the real reason that nobody's come after
        <p></p>you is 'cause they're scared of Mahiru." 4
        <p></p>"Scared?"
        <p></p>"You bet; she's keeping them in check, you know? I mean,
        <p></p>nobody's got the guts to try anything, after the way she acted
        <p></p>on Sports Day. If anyone tried to come after you, Amane,
        <p></p>she'd definitely flip out."
        <p></p>"Flip out… I can't even imagine it."
        <p></p>"Me either, but I bet she would be totally pissed. We all
        <p></p>know that she does well in her studies and sports and that
        <p></p>she's got a pretty face and a hot body. And on top of that, the
        <p></p>teachers all think she's great, so she would be a scary person
        <p></p>to make your enemy. Plus, you know it would be extra
        <p></p>terrifying if a person who is usually so nice got mad at you." 5
        <p></p>Amane quietly agreed with his friend's assessment.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>She is probably the type of person who you shouldn't 1
        <p></p>anger.
        <p></p>He had already said so, but he could hardly even imagine
        <p></p>Mahiru becoming furious.
        <p></p>But he did know that it would be a bad idea to tick her off.
        <p></p>Mahiru always wore a calm smile and wouldn't get angry
        <p></p>at any little thing, but Amane had a feeling that when she
        <p></p>crossed her boiling point, she was liable to knock her
        <p></p>opponent out with a sound argument and a smile. Thinking 3
        <p></p>back to what happened on Sports Day, it was a definite
        <p></p>possibility.
        <p></p>Amane knew better than to infuriate Mahiru, and anyway
        <p></p>he was pretty sure she would get sad before she got angry if
        <p></p>he did something wrong. He resolved to do his best never to
        <p></p>upset her.
        <p></p>"…Are you boys planning to make me mad?"
        <p></p>As Amane was making this vow to himself, Mahiru and
        <p></p>Chitose approached the boys.
        <p></p>"Oh, Shiina! No, not me—we were talking about whether
        <p></p>you would get mad if Amane did something."
        <p></p>"You should know the answer to that already… Of course I
        <p></p>wouldn't lose my temper. We would talk it out calmly, faceto-face, until he understood my feelings."
        <p></p>Her broad smile sent Itsuki trembling terribly.
        <p></p>Mahiru was telling the truth. She was most likely to
        <p></p>explain her feelings at length and get the other party to
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>understand her. Using a smile and a sound argument as her
        <p></p>weapons, she would corner the other person and compel
        <p></p>them to agree with her. She was really someone you
        <p></p>wouldn't want to make enemies with.
        <p></p>"Amane, don't you dare make Mahiru angry!" Chitose
        <p></p>scolded.
        <p></p>"Hey now, I'm not even doing anything!" Amane replied.
        <p></p>"…Actually, Mahiru, what would make you angry?"
        <p></p>"…An affair, maybe?" she answered.
        <p></p>"Do you think I'd cheat?"
        <p></p>"I don't think that at all! It's a ridiculous notion, given
        <p></p>your nature. You're the type of guy who is endlessly devoted
        <p></p>to the people you cherish."
        <p></p>"…Thank you."
        <p></p>"Although, that kind of devotion can wear you out. I think
        <p></p>you stopped at kissing my cheek because you ran out of 1
        <p></p>steam."
        <p></p>"…Mahiru."
        <p></p>"N-no, wait. I didn't mean to complain…and I did get
        <p></p>questions about that mark."
        <p></p>"Great, let's forget it."
        <p></p>If she was going to elaborate on how the mark came to be,
        <p></p>Amane would rather just not bring up the subject.
        <p></p>"Ah, is that—?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Itsuki."
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah, you two, my dear friends, are so painfully
        <p></p>shy. We do that much on a regular basis, right, Chi?" Itsuki
        <p></p>called out to Chitose. The two of them quickly started
        <p></p>pawing at each other.
        <p></p>Amane grumbled internally, We're not up to that level like
        <p></p>you two are!
        <p></p>Of course, the couple who had been dating for two years
        <p></p>had reached certain milestones that Amane and Mahiru
        <p></p>hadn't gotten to yet. He had heard about those kinds of
        <p></p>things from Itsuki before, so he wasn't exactly surprised, but
        <p></p>for some reason or other, he did feel somewhat
        <p></p>embarrassed.
        <p></p>Mahiru must have heard some stuff from Chitose, too,
        <p></p>because her face flushed red instantly, so he knew she was
        <p></p>probably imagining the same things as him.
        <p></p>...All that is probably a ways off, though.
        <p></p>They hadn't even kissed on the lips yet, so joining their
        <p></p>bodies together was a dream beyond a dream. He didn't 3
        <p></p>want to rush to it, either. It was better for them to approach
        <p></p>each other slowly, at their own pace.
        <p></p>When Amane made eye contact with Mahiru, her face got
        <p></p>even redder, and she looked down, so he averted his eyes
        <p></p>from his intensely embarrassed girlfriend.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, when is a good time for us to go visit my
        <p></p>parents?" Amane asked. After the closing ceremony at
        <p></p>school, Mahiru had gone home before coming over.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>He knew that he really should have already decided on the
        <p></p>dates, but he had been in a happy daze since they started
        <p></p>dating. They had also been busy with all sorts of things, so
        <p></p>he hadn't found the chance to talk to her about it, either. His
        <p></p>mother had said that any time was all right, so if Mahiru's
        <p></p>schedule was open, he figured he would go home in August
        <p></p>like he did every year during the Obon holidays.
        <p></p>In response to Amane's question, Mahiru blinked sharply
        <p></p>several times.
        <p></p>"…Ah, or maybe you don't like the idea of coming home
        <p></p>with me?" Amane stammered.
        <p></p>"N-no, I just remembered that we had talked about me
        <p></p>visiting… Um, any time is good for me." Mahiru anxiously
        <p></p>waved her hand in front of her face and insisted she wasn't
        <p></p>opposed to the idea.
        <p></p>Amane smiled meekly and moved on to his next question.
        <p></p>"Gotcha. I wonder how long we should stay? Last year I went
        <p></p>back for about two weeks, the week before and after Obon."
        <p></p>At the moment, he didn't have any standing invitations
        <p></p>from Itsuki or Yuuta and his friends around the time of
        <p></p>Obon, and most people generally spent that time with their
        <p></p>families anyway, so that was probably the best time to go.
        <p></p>They wouldn't have school, either, so that also made it a
        <p></p>good time to travel.
        <p></p>Last year, Amane had stayed a little over two weeks
        <p></p>because he enjoyed not having to do any housework while he
        <p></p>was there, but this year, Mahiru would be with him, so he
        <p></p>needed to take her plans into account. He figured one to two
        <p></p>weeks would be enough time to relax.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"I don't really have any plans, so… Chitose and I haven't
        <p></p>decided when we're going to hang out yet, so you can choose
        <p></p>when you want to take me along with you."
        <p></p>"Okay then, about two weeks should be good. That's a
        <p></p>pretty long time; are you sure it's all right?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>Mahiru said she didn't have any particular plans, so they
        <p></p>settled on the number of days that Amane had proposed.
        <p></p>As a girl, Mahiru apparently needed to bring lots of
        <p></p>clothes, so she suggested sending their luggage ahead of
        <p></p>time, and Amane messaged his mother to let her know to
        <p></p>expect it.
        <p></p>He didn't anticipate an immediate reply, since his mother
        <p></p>was probably at work, but he was sure she would happily
        <p></p>agree and try to get them to extend their stay. Amane's
        <p></p>mother loved anything cute, and she was extremely smitten
        <p></p>with Mahiru.
        <p></p>"I tell you, I bet my mom's going to be thrilled."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, I bet you're right."
        <p></p>"…You'd better prepare yourself, though."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"My mother is gonna want to spend time with you."
        <p></p>Amane was certain his mother was going to make a pest of
        <p></p>herself. She had always wanted a daughter, and she was
        <p></p>liable to conduct herself as if fortune had granted her one at
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>last—and dote on Mahiru the whole time they were there.
        <p></p>"I appreciate her company, though…"
        <p></p>"Well, that's good, but…the thing is…"
        <p></p>"What?"
        <p></p>"…I wonder whether we should tell my parents that we've
        <p></p>started dating?"
        <p></p>When Amane hesitantly mumbled this question, Mahiru
        <p></p>stiffened.
        <p></p>Amane hadn't told his parents yet, and apparently neither
        <p></p>had Mahiru. If they went to his house together, his mother
        <p></p>would be able to tell from the way they acted, and she would
        <p></p>probably tease them. He was conflicted over whether it
        <p></p>would be better to try to mitigate the damage by saying
        <p></p>something in advance.
        <p></p>But the scary thing about his mother was that Amane had
        <p></p>no idea whether telling her beforehand would make it any
        <p></p>easier—or if it would conversely make it worse.
        <p></p>"…Wh-what should we do? It would be embarrassing to
        <p></p>make a formal announcement."
        <p></p>"I know. But she's definitely going to pry."
        <p></p>"Well, since I'm making their precious son a part my life, I
        <p></p>think I should address them personally."
        <p></p>"I'm the one who's going to make you a part of my family, 5
        <p></p>though…"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane said it almost as if he considered it a settled
        <p></p>matter, but the moment Mahiru heard it, her face turned
        <p></p>bright red, and she hugged a cushion tight. 2
        <p></p>"…You know I appreciate that you can say stuff like that
        <p></p>without hesitation, but saying it too easily is a bad thing."
        <p></p>"Which is it?"
        <p></p>"Well, as long as you only say it to me, it's a good thing."
        <p></p>"Do you think I would say that about anyone other than
        <p></p>you…?"
        <p></p>Amane wondered what Mahiru was worried about. She
        <p></p>must have known full well that he didn't even look at other
        <p></p>girls.
        <p></p>"…That, too, is another good quality of yours. And I think
        <p></p>it must be the result of your father's upbringing."
        <p></p>"Why my father?"
        <p></p>Amane was confused by Mahiru's sudden mention of him.
        <p></p>She leaned against Amane, still holding the cushion, so for
        <p></p>the moment, he just stroked her hair.
        <p></p>He did it lovingly, not to try to appease her, but out of
        <p></p>pure affection, and Mahiru let him do it, casting her eyes
        <p></p>down bashfully. She looked like she was enjoying it, so
        <p></p>Amane figured she didn't mind.
        <p></p>"…I bet you're going to be a lot like your father in the
        <p></p>future, Amane."
        <p></p>"Really? I don't have as much of a baby face as he does,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>though."
        <p></p>"Not in the looks department, but on the inside."
        <p></p>"I'm not confident that I'll turn out as calm and
        <p></p>composed, either."
        <p></p>"…That's not what I meant…dummy."
        <p></p>Mahiru whispered that last word so quietly it just barely
        <p></p>reached Amane's ears, and she leaned against his arm, so
        <p></p>when he deliberately shifted his body back, she fell and
        <p></p>plunked down into his lap.
        <p></p>He watched the caramel color disappear and reappear
        <p></p>several times behind her blinking eyes, then he smiled and
        <p></p>cupped his hand around her cheeks.
        <p></p>"I can't be as gentlemanly as him, but I'd like to spoil you
        <p></p>in my own way."
        <p></p>"…See, this is what I was talking about."
        <p></p>"My dad indulges my mom way more than I indulge you."
        <p></p>"…He does. I think I would drown in it."
        <p></p>Still resting her head in his lap, Mahiru placed her own
        <p></p>hand on top of Amane's, as if to cover it, and closed her eyes
        <p></p>with a peaceful expression.
        <p></p>A smile appeared on Mahiru's lips as she leaned up and
        <p></p>pressed her cheek against him.
        <p></p>"…Maybe you could drown me a little more?" 1
        <p></p>"As much as you like… Although, we'd be in trouble if you
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>did at the pool next week."
        <p></p>"…Dummy."
        <p></p>This time, she delivered the adorable insult in a peevish
        <p></p>voice, loud enough for him to hear clearly, and Amane
        <p></p>laughed out loud and stroked Mahiru's cheek again.

        <p></p>Chapter 63: If Anything, You’re Cute
        <p></p>Today, they visited the pool, and Amane was getting 1
        <p></p>changed in the locker room, feeling vaguely nervous.
        <p></p>He and Mahiru were at a water park on the outskirts of
        <p></p>the city, and they had split up to get changed, but…Mahiru
        <p></p>had been the subject of many stares from other guys before
        <p></p>they even entered the facility, and it wasn't hard to imagine
        <p></p>that they would all be mesmerized by her in her swimsuit.
        <p></p>In a situation like this, Chitose could have been a good
        <p></p>distraction if she were there, but today, it was just the two of
        <p></p>them. Mahiru had made puppy-dog eyes and said she
        <p></p>wanted to go alone together, and there was no way he could
        <p></p>turn her down.
        <p></p>Resolving that he would have to protect her somehow
        <p></p>from the groping hands of other guys, Amane changed into
        <p></p>his swimsuit, pulled on his rash guard, and left the locker
        <p></p>room.
        <p></p>He arrived at the agreed-upon meeting place and waited
        <p></p>for Mahiru to show up, but she was taking a long time.
        <p></p>He wasn't going to complain; it was something he had, in
        <p></p>fact, anticipated. He figured it probably took girls longer to
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>prepare than guys, and that their locker room might be more
        <p></p>crowded.
        <p></p>Appreciating again how tough it must be to be a girl,
        <p></p>Amane leaned back against the sturdy lamppost they had
        <p></p>chosen as their meeting spot.
        <p></p>Even though it was summer vacation, it was a weekday, so
        <p></p>while there were relatively fewer people than there might
        <p></p>have been, the place was still pretty packed.
        <p></p>As Amane was standing there absently watching people of
        <p></p>all ages, men and women, pass by in their swimsuits, he
        <p></p>caught sight of familiar flaxen hair in the gaps between the
        <p></p>crowd.
        <p></p>"Amane."
        <p></p>As expected, his own darling girlfriend was headed his
        <p></p>way.
        <p></p>But as soon as he saw her, he wondered whether it might
        <p></p>have been a mistake to bring her to the pool. The eyes of
        <p></p>many other patrons were following her as she approached
        <p></p>him.
        <p></p>Normally, he wasn't so conscious of it, but Mahiru was
        <p></p>truly extraordinarily beautiful. She was equal to any model
        <p></p>in a magazine—in fact, he thought Mahiru was even prettier.
        <p></p>So as expected, she was going to attract a lot of attention
        <p></p>in her bathing suit.
        <p></p>"Sorry to keep you waiting; the locker room was
        <p></p>crowded."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Uh-huh."
        <p></p>They were right by the water, so Mahiru hurried over,
        <p></p>without running, and stood before Amane, who was smiling
        <p></p>faintly.
        <p></p>Now that she was standing right in front of him in her
        <p></p>swimsuit, Amane really wasn't sure where to look. 3
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed like the type whose skin would turn red
        <p></p>and painful if she got too much sun, and she was much more
        <p></p>careful about sun exposure than most people, so she was
        <p></p>strikingly pale. There wasn't a single blemish on her milkwhite skin, which had never known a sunburn.
        Standing
        <p></p>there under the summer sun in her swimsuit, she was
        <p></p>dazzling—in a single word, magnificent.
        <p></p>Amane had always known that Mahiru was slender, but
        <p></p>she really was fit. Though she was slim, she didn't look too
        <p></p>skinny, and her figure retained an unmistakably feminine
        <p></p>softness. She wasn't just thin, she had curves in all the right
        <p></p>places, like the soft, full line of her bust beneath her frilly
        <p></p>white bikini top.
        <p></p>Amane had always assumed Mahiru chose clothing that
        <p></p>minimized her bust, but he'd never realized the extent of it.
        <p></p>Yet they weren't so big that they looked unnatural or
        <p></p>mismatched with her small stature. They were the ideal size,
        <p></p>well-balanced and just right to fit in his hands. 19
        <p></p>He was shocked that modest Mahiru had picked a bikini,
        <p></p>but there was nothing lewd about her choice. The large frills
        <p></p>at the top hid her cleavage, and on Mahiru, the outfit looked 4
        <p></p>elegant and clean.
        <p></p>Seeing Mahiru in her bathing suit made his head spin.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane had never looked at anything racier than the pinups
        <p></p>in the backs of magazines. Seeing his girlfriend in one was
        <p></p>dazzling.
        <p></p>"…How is it?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had come close enough to touch, and she asked
        <p></p>for his opinion with her hand on her chest, as if she was
        <p></p>feeling a little embarrassed. 1
        <p></p>Because Amane was a little taller, he found himself
        <p></p>staring down at the shadow of her bust beneath the frills,
        <p></p>gulping.
        <p></p>"Amane?"
        <p></p>When he didn't answer, Mahiru inquisitively touched his
        <p></p>arm, and finally he unfroze.
        <p></p>"…D-does it suit me?" she asked.
        <p></p>There was no question about that. In fact, it suited her too
        <p></p>well, and he didn't know how to look at her.
        <p></p>"Absolutely. It looks great on you. I wish we were alone; 7
        <p></p>it's very cute."
        <p></p>"Th-thank you."
        <p></p>Amane shared his thoughts, knowing that he was
        <p></p>supposed to compliment girls on their clothes and that he
        <p></p>wouldn't be much of a man if he couldn't offer one or two
        <p></p>when his adorable girlfriend had done her very best to pick
        <p></p>out a swimsuit. Mahiru exhaled in relief.
        <p></p>But it was easy to tell from the way she was blushing that
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru must have also felt embarrassed from being exposed
        <p></p>more than usual.
        <p></p>Amane thought that if she was so self-conscious, she
        <p></p>ought to have picked a suit with a little more coverage, like
        <p></p>maybe a one-piece. But he figured that her choice had been
        <p></p>influenced by Chitose, who was probably mostly to blame.
        <p></p>Even so…
        <p></p>Glancing around, there were a surprising number of men
        <p></p>staring at Mahiru in her swimsuit.
        <p></p>Even men who were with other women were looking at 4
        <p></p>her, completely engrossed, and some of them were even
        <p></p>getting slapped by women whom he assumed were their
        <p></p>girlfriends.
        <p></p>That was proof that just by standing there, Mahiru had
        <p></p>become the angel of the waterside. But as her boyfriend,
        <p></p>Amane wasn't having much fun. It was uncomfortable seeing
        <p></p>people ogle his girlfriend in her swimsuit.
        <p></p>"Of course, it looks great on you, but—"
        <p></p>"But?"
        <p></p>"…It's no good."
        <p></p>Amane took off his hooded rash guard and draped it over
        <p></p>Mahiru's shoulders.
        <p></p>Since she was so petite, the hem hung down to her thighs,
        <p></p>so he figured it was sufficient protection from wandering
        <p></p>eyes.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Of course, the beauty of her slender legs would probably
        <p></p>still draw attention, but he couldn't cover everything, so
        <p></p>there was nothing to be done.
        <p></p>"Put that on."
        <p></p>"But…what about you?"
        <p></p>"…What if I told you that I don't really want other guys to
        <p></p>look at you?"
        <p></p>That was how he really felt. He completely understood
        <p></p>why Mahiru attracted so many eyes, since he also
        <p></p>appreciated her ample feminine figure, but the truth was
        <p></p>that he didn't like it.
        <p></p>When he whispered his feelings into her ear, Mahiru's
        <p></p>cheeks turned so red it looked like she was sunburned, and
        <p></p>she answered quietly, "O-okay…"
        <p></p>He quickly zipped up the front of the rash guard and
        <p></p>heard disappointed sighs from all around them. Relieved
        <p></p>that he had protected his girlfriend from the wicked,
        <p></p>wandering eyes of other men, Amane rolled up one of the
        <p></p>loose sleeves until he could grasp Mahiru's hand.
        <p></p>"Come on, let's go."
        <p></p>"Okay."
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded weakly and squeezed his hand back, and
        <p></p>Amane started walking slowly.
        <p></p>Since they were by the water, he had intended to take her
        <p></p>hand when they were strolling in any case, to keep her from
        <p></p>slipping, but now it also served as a major deterrent to other
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>guys.
        <p></p>Walking by Mahiru's side as imposingly as he could,
        <p></p>Amane was headed for the shallow pool, when Mahiru
        <p></p>looked up at him and whispered, "…Amane?"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"…If we were alone, would you have looked at me in my
        <p></p>swimsuit for a long time?"
        <p></p>"If we were alone, I would have gotten my fill of looking,
        <p></p>and I probably would have found the courage to touch you, 4
        <p></p>too." Deliberately exaggerating to make fun of himself,
        <p></p>Amane added, "Though, of course, all that staring and
        <p></p>touching would be risky, so I'd have to try hard to restrain
        <p></p>myself."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked worried for some reason.
        <p></p>After seeming to worry about it for a full ten seconds,
        <p></p>Mahiru, still holding his hand, closed the distance between
        <p></p>them even more. To be more precise, she glued herself to his
        <p></p>arm. The soft feeling that reached him through the rash 1
        <p></p>guard made it Amane's turn to blush.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, you bumped into me."
        <p></p>"…In this case, I think it's more accurate to say that I'm
        <p></p>touching you." 4
        <p></p>"The angel part of you isn't doing her job."
        <p></p>"When girls are with someone they like, they can become 1
        <p></p>angels or devils."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Apparently, Mahiru was a devil today. 1
        <p></p>Despite that, she was shaking terribly with
        <p></p>embarrassment and her face was bright red. But she didn't
        <p></p>seem inclined to let go of him and purposely pressed her
        <p></p>chest into Amane's arm, right above his elbow, so that he
        <p></p>could scarcely bend the limb without burying it right
        <p></p>between her breasts.
        <p></p>"…I don't really mind you staying close, but you should
        <p></p>know that I'm enjoying it." 5
        <p></p>"Th-that's a wild thing for you to say, but…I don't mind."
        <p></p>"…You dummy."
        <p></p>Amane hadn't expected her to approve. He groaned in
        <p></p>spite of himself and, contrary to his word, tried desperately
        <p></p>to distract himself from the soft sensation pressing against
        <p></p>his arm by mentally reciting the digits of pi that he had been 9
        <p></p>forced to memorize years earlier.
        <p></p>Hand in hand with Mahiru, who still drew plenty of looks,
        <p></p>Amane arrived at a comparatively shallow pool and,
        <p></p>swinging the small waterproof bag that he had in hand,
        <p></p>looked at Mahiru by his side.
        <p></p>"So what's the plan?"
        <p></p>"The plan?"
        <p></p>"I mean, the pools in this water park aren't really meant
        <p></p>for swimming lessons. Besides, you wouldn't know what to
        <p></p>do if I suddenly suggested you start swimming, would you?"
        <p></p>"That's true, but…"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane was a fairly good swimmer, so he was fully capable
        <p></p>of teaching her, but they weren't at a pool with separate
        <p></p>lanes that they could use for swimming class, so they were
        <p></p>sure to run into other people.
        <p></p>The pools in the park were mostly meant for people to
        <p></p>play in the water rather than do any serious swimming.
        <p></p>Those who really wanted to would surely take lessons.
        <p></p>"If you want to learn, that's fine, but as far as I'm
        <p></p>concerned… Well, since we came all the way here, I just want
        <p></p>to have a good time with you."
        <p></p>"Th-that's—um, me too. I'm happy just being here with
        <p></p>you, Amane." Mahiru turned her eyes up at him and pressed
        <p></p>herself close again. He was beginning to appreciate how
        <p></p>charming she could be while acting devilish.
        <p></p>To recover his composure, Amane patted his adorable
        <p></p>girlfriend on the head.
        <p></p>"All right, let's hang out and relax together. Besides, if we
        <p></p>were going to properly swim, you would have to take off that
        <p></p>rash guard."
        <p></p>Mahiru's slim yet voluptuous body was hidden by
        <p></p>Amane's rash guard, but the shirt would get in the way if
        <p></p>they started swimming, and she would probably need to
        <p></p>remove it.
        <p></p>If Mahiru did that, all the guys around them would
        <p></p>probably look at her, and Amane wouldn't be able to take his
        <p></p>eyes off her, either.
        <p></p>As her boyfriend, he felt like he didn't have to feel guilty
        <p></p>about checking her out in a swimsuit, but he worried that
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>staring at her beauty for too long would give him a heart
        <p></p>attack. The area under her bikini top was especially
        <p></p>dangerous to look at.
        <p></p>"…Do you plan to keep me hidden forever?"
        <p></p>"No… Well, it seems wrong to show you off…"
        <p></p>"…Don't you want to look?"
        <p></p>"I mean, I do, but I have zero doubt that I'd die."
        <p></p>"Why would you die…?"
        <p></p>Mahiru sounded exasperated. Amane figured there was
        <p></p>no way that she could understand how he felt. As a man, he
        <p></p>wanted to look at her, of course, but he didn't know if he
        <p></p>could take it. The stress would kill him, socially and 3
        <p></p>spiritually.
        <p></p>"…Well, you almost died when you saw my naked chest,
        <p></p>didn't you?"
        <p></p>"Th-that's um—"
        <p></p>"By the way, it seemed like you were going to have trouble
        <p></p>looking at other guys' chests, but you appear to be handling
        <p></p>it okay today, huh?"
        <p></p>Given Mahiru's naïveté, Amane had been certain she
        <p></p>would feel awkward seeing other men in their bathing suits,
        <p></p>but so far, though she had been blushing at Amane's words
        <p></p>and actions, she didn't seem outwardly embarrassed by any
        <p></p>of them.
        <p></p>When he made that observation, Mahiru drew her
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>shoulders together bashfully.
        <p></p>"Um. I'm not interested in anyone but you, Amane… I'm
        <p></p>not looking."
        <p></p>"…Ah—"
        <p></p>"A-actually, my heart was pounding again today when I
        <p></p>saw you in your swimsuit, you know? Compared to before,
        <p></p>you're really…lean—and more fit. S-sexy is what I mean." 2
        <p></p>Mahiru glanced up briefly at Amane, then her eyes darted
        <p></p>around nervously.
        <p></p>The first time Mahiru had seen Amane's body must have
        <p></p>been when she was nursing him through that cold a long
        <p></p>time back. Certainly, compared to back then, everything
        <p></p>about him had changed, from the way he led his life to his
        <p></p>perception of himself. Back then, he had never even
        <p></p>considered trying to change his string bean body.
        <p></p>…I guess the results have been pretty good?
        <p></p>He knew he couldn't compare to anyone who seriously
        <p></p>went to the gym for bodybuilding, but Amane liked to think
        <p></p>that, for a high school student, he had done pretty well so
        <p></p>far.
        <p></p>"I mean, Amane, you're attracting attention, too, you
        <p></p>know? You're not too skinny, and you look really good—firm
        <p></p>but flexible."
        <p></p>"Thanks for saying so… It feels a little funny when you
        <p></p>compliment me, but it's kind of nice."
        <p></p>"Wh-what do you mean?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Like, to think that you were looking so closely, when you
        <p></p>always acted innocent before…"
        <p></p>"A-are you making fun of me? I mean, I want to get a good
        <p></p>look at the person I love."
        <p></p>As she said that, Mahiru looked directly at Amane's chest,
        <p></p>but her eyes immediately started darting around, which was
        <p></p>more like her.
        <p></p>She seemed to notice his little smile. Her cheeks flushed
        <p></p>again, and she opened her eyes wide.
        <p></p>"Y-you can't talk anyway, Amane! Your heart's pounding!"
        <p></p>Mahiru desperately slapped her hand down on Amane's
        <p></p>chest to feel his heartbeat, and there was no way he could
        <p></p>really hide it, so he nodded obediently.
        <p></p>Amane thought that any guy whose heart didn't pound the
        <p></p>first time they saw their girlfriend in a bikini wasn't a man at
        <p></p>all, so this was an entirely normal reaction. In fact, he would
        <p></p>have appreciated a little recognition for his self-control.
        <p></p>"…It would be crazy to think that my heart wouldn't be
        <p></p>pounding at the sight of the girl I love in her swimsuit,
        <p></p>right?"
        <p></p>"Th-that's true, but in that case, surely it's all right for
        <p></p>mine to be beating this fast, too?"
        <p></p>"Sure. I'm happy to know that."
        <p></p>That alone was evidence that she thought of him as her
        <p></p>boyfriend, which made Amane embarrassed and glad. But he
        <p></p>also felt like he was going to melt and wished she would tone
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>it down.
        <p></p>To Amane, who had calmly reassured her, Mahiru kept
        <p></p>moving her mouth like she wanted to say something to him.
        <p></p>But then she seemed to give up and pressed her lips tightly
        <p></p>shut as she flattened herself against his arm. She seemed to
        <p></p>realize that words weren't going to do the trick and tried to
        <p></p>win against Amane with brute force, so he pressed his lips
        <p></p>together, too, but this time he let her do as she pleased
        <p></p>without showing her the agitation she was hoping for.
        <p></p>"You didn't catch me off guard, so it won't work this
        <p></p>time."
        <p></p>"…He says, as his heart pounds even harder than before." 1
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>Amane turned away, betrayed by his own heartbeat, and
        <p></p>Mahiru let out a cheerful laugh and rested her cheek against
        <p></p>his shoulder.

        <p></p>Chapter 64: Poolside Playboys Are Expected
        <p></p>Eventually, a thoroughly shaken Amane was able to
        <p></p>regain his composure, and he set foot into the pool with
        <p></p>Mahiru by his side.
        <p></p>For Amane, who was already at adult height, the water
        <p></p>came up to about his hips, but for Mahiru it reached her
        <p></p>solar plexus, which didn't make it seem particularly shallow.
        <p></p>She looked up at Amane with a slightly worried expression.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru, you're not gonna drown; you'll be fine."
        <p></p>"Amane, people can die by drowning in as little as thirty
        <p></p>centimeters of water."
        <p></p>"Okay, listen… I won't let that happen, but if by some
        <p></p>chance you do, I'll give you CPR."
        <p></p>In order to encourage her, he spoke cheerfully, but
        <p></p>Mahiru kept clinging to Amane's arm and looked up at him
        <p></p>again. In her eyes, he saw a little bit of sulking and a shade
        <p></p>of expectation.
        <p></p>"…You won't keep me from drowning?"
        <p></p>Without meaning to, his gaze locked on Mahiru after she
        <p></p>murmured this with a tone of slight disappointment.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>The small bulge formed by her pouting lips looked 1
        <p></p>dissatisfied and…kind of pleading, but he figured that was
        <p></p>his imagination.
        <p></p>Looking at her light-pink lips, which hadn't lost any of
        <p></p>their luster even though she wasn't wearing lip balm, Amane
        <p></p>gulped audibly. But there was no way he could cast away all
        <p></p>reason and kiss her then and there, so he shifted his gaze to
        <p></p>the side.
        <p></p>"…I-I'd like for us to wait a little bit longer, so…um, we
        <p></p>can't, not here."
        <p></p>"I—I never said that I want you to do it here. But, well…
        <p></p>I'm starting to wonder if you don't want to, Amane."
        <p></p>"Of course I don't not w-want to!! I always want to!"
        <p></p>Surely there wasn't a guy in the world who didn't want to
        <p></p>kiss the girl he liked. Even Amane, who was not a
        <p></p>particularly romantic person, still wanted to touch Mahiru a
        <p></p>lot and kiss her as much as he pleased.
        <p></p>He knew they had to work up to it step by step, and he
        <p></p>was confident that she would pull away if he was always 4
        <p></p>forcing his desires on her, so he had been holding back, but
        <p></p>it was unthinkable that he didn't want to.
        <p></p>At Amane's strong assertion, Mahiru once again flushed
        <p></p>red, pressed her forehead against his arm, and hid her face.
        <p></p>The fact that she was red all the way to her ears made
        <p></p>Amane think that he had said something wrong, and he
        <p></p>began to blush as well.
        <p></p>"…Y-you've got the wrong idea—"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Do I?"
        <p></p>"Well, it's not wrong exactly, but, um… If we do that, I'll
        <p></p>have a hard time today, so please just wait a little longer."
        <p></p>Amane had often been ridiculed by Itsuki for being a late
        <p></p>bloomer and a wuss, and at this point, he couldn't deny it. 1
        <p></p>From Mahiru's perspective, she was probably getting
        <p></p>really impatient with Amane. He was treasuring her too
        <p></p>much and moving at a slow pace, and she had been waiting
        <p></p>for him the whole time.
        <p></p>…I guess Mahiru wants to go further?
        <p></p>She must want to do more things that lovers do? 1
        <p></p>He looked down at Mahiru to confirm his thoughts, and
        <p></p>she had her eyes turned up at him with half of her flushed
        <p></p>face still hidden.
        <p></p>"…You do what you like, Amane. But Chitose said that
        <p></p>making yourself hold back too long isn't good… Don't overdo
        <p></p>it…"
        <p></p>"Ugh, Chitoseee—"
        <p></p>"A-after all, Chitose has been in a relationship longer than
        <p></p>either of us, so…"
        <p></p>"She's definitely been a bad influence on you, don't you
        <p></p>see?! L-listen, Mahiru, we can go at whatever pace feels right 1
        <p></p>for us. I'm not trying to go unreasonably fast, and, um…if we
        <p></p>rush too much, I think you'll end up floundering, too."
        <p></p>He believed she also wanted to move things forward, but
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>he was worried that if they hurried things, Mahiru would
        <p></p>feel like she was under too much pressure, so Amane
        <p></p>thought a slow pace was best. 1
        <p></p>Amane wanted to proceed slowly for his own sake, too,
        <p></p>since he didn't know what he might do if he let himself get
        <p></p>carried away.
        <p></p>When he appealed to her with earnest eyes, Mahiru
        <p></p>looked down, making an embarrassed face, and pressed her
        <p></p>forehead against his arm once more.
        <p></p>"O-okay. Um… Sh-should we go swimming?"
        <p></p>"Y-yeah, we should…"
        <p></p>"…This is my first time coming to a place like this, so
        <p></p>please tell me about everything."
        <p></p>She added quietly that she had rarely gone places with
        <p></p>other people, so Amane took her hand, and they walked to
        <p></p>the middle of the shallow pool.
        <p></p>He guessed that her family had probably never taken her
        <p></p>to any kind of amusement park before, and he felt sad for
        <p></p>her. He decided they should go experience one of those
        <p></p>together sometime.
        <p></p>"So over summer break, how about we check off all of
        <p></p>your 'firsts,' Mahiru?" 4
        <p></p>"…P-putting it that way is embarrassing, but…okay."
        <p></p>Mahiru flushed red but smiled happily. Amane beamed
        <p></p>back at her and pulled her along by the hand to a spot that 2
        <p></p>seemed to have slightly fewer people.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru had been anxious about potential drownings, but
        <p></p>perhaps because she was with Amane, she didn't seem
        <p></p>worried as long as they were just playing in the water.
        <p></p>When Amane rented an inner tube and handed it to
        <p></p>Mahiru, she grumbled about it with a slightly peeved
        <p></p>expression. "I feel like I'm being treated like a child…" Yet
        <p></p>maybe because it gave her a sense of safety, she put the ring
        <p></p>around her body.
        <p></p>While holding on to the tube, Mahiru relaxed and floated 2
        <p></p>on top of the water, gazing up at Amane with a placid look.
        <p></p>Amane was standing by the side watching her, just in
        <p></p>case, but the way things were going, he figured she wouldn't
        <p></p>have any trouble enjoying herself.
        <p></p>"This feels great, doesn't it?" Mahiru smiled, bobbing
        <p></p>around in her ring by Amane's side.
        <p></p>"Sure does," Amane leaned against the edge of the inner
        <p></p>tube and nodded.
        <p></p>Amane liked swimming but had never particularly cared
        <p></p>for playing around in the shallow pools. But being able to
        <p></p>spend a relaxing time with Mahiru was not a bad thing. If
        <p></p>they had been with Chitose and Itsuki, the two of them
        <p></p>would have wanted to play with a beach ball or go down the
        <p></p>waterslides or something.
        <p></p>That kind of stuff wasn't bad, either, but Amane liked
        <p></p>having some relaxing alone time with Mahiru.
        <p></p>"With the ring, you won't drown, and you can enjoy the
        <p></p>water as much as you like."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…But it's awfully humiliating, using one at this age."
        <p></p>"Even adult women use them all the time. Look, there are
        <p></p>people sitting in inner tubes over there, too."
        <p></p>Amane pointed to where some women in swimsuits were
        <p></p>floating with their backsides down in the holes of their rings.
        <p></p>Rather than using them as swimming aids, most of the
        <p></p>adults were chilling in similar positions.
        <p></p>Mahiru, who had stuck her body through the ring, looked
        <p></p>in the direction Amane was indicating, then excitedly stood
        <p></p>back up for a second and sat down into the ring.
        <p></p>Floating there with her body fully supported by the inner
        <p></p>tube, Mahiru blinked several times, then smiled, looking
        <p></p>mighty pleased with herself. She seemed to like it. 3
        <p></p>Her bare, milk-white legs, sticking out of the bottom of
        <p></p>Amane's rash guard, kicked and splashed in the water.
        <p></p>Her legs were slender yet amply soft, and Amane got
        <p></p>splashed in the face while he was captivated by their beauty.
        <p></p>Mahiru was giggling, wearing a happy, carefree smile.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't tell whether she had known where he was
        <p></p>looking, or whether she had done that on purpose, but…for
        <p></p>the time being, he splashed her lightly to get back at her, and
        <p></p>Mahiru's smile widened.
        <p></p>"Now you've done it, hey!"
        <p></p>She had probably been trying to snap him out of his
        <p></p>trance.

        <p></p>Mahiru launched another water attack against him, and
        <p></p>Amane smiled a little and struck back.
        <p></p>But since Mahiru was rather immobile in the inner tube,
        <p></p>she made for an easy target.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>With the palm of his hand, Amane gently splashed some
        <p></p>water onto Mahiru's chest, and she did the same back at
        <p></p>him. She must have also been holding back as this attack
        <p></p>only reached his chest.
        <p></p>Amane was fully soaked. The water still felt cool on his
        <p></p>skin. He smiled with his whole face and splashed Mahiru
        <p></p>some more.
        <p></p>He was going easy on her because Mahiru seemed liable
        <p></p>to flip over if he overdid it, but she was cheerfully kicking the
        <p></p>water in a stroking motion, splashing away.
        <p></p>Each time she kicked, she was thrown a little off-balance.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, hey—"
        <p></p>It would have been awful if she tipped over with the inner
        <p></p>tube, so Amane leaned against the ring to stabilize her, and
        <p></p>Mahiru clung tightly to him.
        <p></p>She was still frightened of falling into the water.
        <p></p>"If you thrash around too much, you're going to fall over."
        <p></p>"Uh…sorry."
        <p></p>"I'm right here, so it's fine, but…"
        <p></p>"…If I wasn't with you, I wouldn't have been playing
        <p></p>around so much," she whispered quietly.
        <p></p>Against his better judgment, Amane stared at Mahiru.
        <p></p>She wrapped her arms around his back, buried her face in
        <p></p>his chest, and continued, "…But I am with you, and I'm
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>having so much fun… The whole world is sparkling…
        <p></p>Besides, I knew you would help me if I needed it."
        <p></p>"…I, um, I don't know what to say when you tell me cute
        <p></p>things like that."
        <p></p>Amane's face automatically turned red at her whispered
        <p></p>words of love.
        <p></p>It made him want to groan.
        <p></p>How can she be so cute in every way?!
