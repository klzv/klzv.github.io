        "…It's more than enough."<p></p>
        "Well then… Someday, when I'm feeling down again, you can be there for me, and that<p></p>
        will make us even." Her tone of voice was playful, and it was clear she had no intention<p></p>
        of giving up.<p></p>
        Amane surrendered at last and leaned into Mahiru. But this time, he put his arm<p></p>
        around her back and made sure to lean against her shoulder, instead of her chest. It<p></p>
        was the best he could do.<p></p>
        Mahiru smiled at Amane's choice, then tightly embraced him and accepted his full<p></p>
        weight.<p></p>
        "This isn't right…"<p></p>
        Several dozen minutes had passed, though it felt like much longer for Amane. When<p></p>
        he raised his head and pulled away from her, his voice was cold and had an edge. He<p></p>
        wasn't angry at Mahiru, though. He was ashamed of himself, for taking advantage of<p></p>
        her kindness.<p></p>
        But Mahiru just smiled and showed no sign of concern. "Well, I do hate to see you<p></p>
        feeling sad, so… next time I'll try to spoil you even sooner."<p></p>
        "…That's not exactly what I meant…"<p></p>
        Amane caught himself glancing down at her chest again. He quickly averted his eyes.<p></p>
        She was being so kind to him, and he didn't want to be vulgar. He'd managed to keep<p></p>
        himself in check this time, but next time, he thought, he might not be able to save<p></p>
        himself so easily.<p></p>
        Mahiru trusted Amane. She wouldn't have embraced him if she wasn't comfortable<p></p>
        with him. But he was still somewhat surprised that she was being so insistent.<p></p>
        And although her tenderness had eased the pain of his old wounds, that only left him<p></p>
        free to focus on the new aching in his heart.<p></p>
        "Why do you always turn away from me?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        "I don't know what to do with myself when you spoil me like that. I mean, I am a guy,<p></p>
        after all."<p></p>
        "I know that…"<p></p>
        "It's not clear that you do. Like, seriously."<p></p>
        She should be more careful, he thought. What if he had taken advantage of her and<p></p>
        rubbed his face wherever he pleased? What would she have done then? He wanted her<p></p>
        to understand that there were some lines she shouldn't let even him cross.<p></p>
        He wasn't confident he would be able to control himself the next time he was faced<p></p>
        with the temptation of being given the go-ahead to bury his face in the chest of the girl<p></p>
        he loved. Amane sighed. Mahiru was too trusting and would probably forgive him for<p></p>
        almost anything.<p></p>
        Mahiru's eyes narrowed. She looked absolutely hurt.<p></p>
        "…Amane, I don't understand you at all."<p></p>
        "What about me?"<p></p>
        "Everything, all of it. You dummy."<p></p>
        Mahiru stood up from the sofa in an angry huff. Even her insults sounded adorable.<p></p>
        Leaving Amane to ponder her anger, she turned away and headed for the kitchen.<p></p>
        He watched her leave in a daze. She looked so small and unsteady, but just a moment<p></p>
        ago, she'd been supporting him.<p></p>
        "Amane, you're such an airhead sometimes." She kept on rebuking him in a quiet, angry<p></p>
        voice that she apparently didn't think he could hear, so Amane just watched her go<p></p>
        with a shrug and a smile—<p></p>
        "Even though I wouldn't do that for anyone but you."<p></p>
        And then his ears picked up another quiet grumble.<p></p>
        His breath caught in his throat.<p></p>
        For a second, his brain refused to process her words. It was so shocking to him.<p></p>
        He forced himself to take a shallow breath.<p></p>
        And then the intense surge of emotion swirling in his chest practically forced Amane<p></p>
        to his feet. He found himself reaching out toward her.<p></p>
        "…Hey, Mahiru?"<p></p>
        "What is… it?"<p></p>
        Before she could turn around, Amane had wrapped Mahiru up in his arms, embracing 3<p></p>
        her tightly as though he were shielding her from the world. Mahiru's slender frame<p></p>
        began to tremble, and her voice wavered, but she didn't push him away or seem upset.<p></p>
        He could tell she was shaking with surprise.<p></p>
        Amane wrapped his arms around her delicate body. Just a moment ago, she had been<p></p>
        supporting him. Now he put his chin on top of her head so she couldn't turn around.<p></p>
        "…You didn't mind hugging from the front, but now that it's from behind, you're<p></p>
        spooked," Amane teased.<p></p>
        "Anyone would be surprised by being hugged so suddenly!"<p></p>
        "You're the one who said I could lean on you. Though I held back because I knew this<p></p>
        would happen… It's bad for my heart."<p></p>
        Amane hadn't meant for this to happen. He was going to let Mahiru go off and pout, but<p></p>
        when he'd heard what she'd said, he felt a sudden surge of emotion, embarrassment,<p></p>
        and elation all at once, and reason left him—and his body had sought out Mahiru of<p></p>
        its own accord.<p></p>
        Gently, yet tightly, like he didn't want to let her slip away, he held on to Mahiru, who<p></p>
        felt like she might shatter if he squeezed too hard.<p></p>
        Mahiru tried to wriggle her way around to face him, but Amane whispered into her<p></p>
        ear, "Don't turn around."<p></p>
        She hung her head. Her face was bright red, and he heard her mutter, "…You dummy."<p></p>
        …I am a dummy; you're absolutely right.<p></p>
        He couldn't deny it. Here he was, taking advantage of her kindness in a vulnerable<p></p>
        moment… He was certainly a bad person.<p></p>
        But Mahiru hadn't pulled away from his touch, and he was grateful for that at least. He<p></p>
        enjoyed her warmth as he pressed his face into her hair, just as she had done to him<p></p>
        earlier, when she was trying to get him to accept her generosity. The difference<p></p>
        between then and now, Amane thought, was that he knew how she would respond.<p></p>
        "Now do you understand how I was feeling before?" he asked.<p></p>
        "I—I do, but—"<p></p>
        The shrillness in her voice told him she was upset. Her ears were red, and even though<p></p>
        he couldn't actually tell from this angle, Amane had no doubt that her face had also<p></p>
        turned the same intense color.<p></p>
        Even Amane understood he had done something bad. He'd only done this because he<p></p>
        had been sure she wouldn't turn him down.<p></p>
        "…Um, so look. You really don't need to worry so much about me," he said. "It's not like<p></p>
        I'm dying from some terrible condition or something. And besides, I can be pretty<p></p>
        shameless, so if you spoil me too much, I'll end up taking advantage of your kindness."<p></p>
        Mahiru listened quietly to Amane's words, then let out a sigh. "…If you find it satisfying,<p></p>
        if it helps heal you, then I'm not going to refuse a hug."<p></p>
        She reached up with one hand and gently touched him on the arm. She didn't brush<p></p>
        him away or smack him; she simply placed her hand gently on his arm, as if to draw<p></p>
        him closer. Amane warned himself not to get too carried away, but he still pressed his<p></p>
        face into Mahiru's hair again.<p></p>
        "I'm a crafty guy, you know. I knew you would accept the burden, so I started relying<p></p>
        on you."<p></p>
        "What are you talking about? I've always known you're trouble."<p></p>
        Amane knew his recent actions had stemmed from his own cowardice, but he wasn't<p></p>
        quite sure what she meant by trouble.<p></p>
        "…I feel like there's something you want to say to me…"<p></p>
        "Yes, if you have any self-awareness at all, then it's time to shape up and fly right. My<p></p>
        heart really can't take any more of this." 1<p></p>
        "I really don't have a clue what you're talking about," Amane protested.<p></p>
        "Mm-hmm," Mahiru hummed, then slapped Amane on the arm. It didn't hurt, and he<p></p>
        laughed quietly at her playful attack.<p></p>
        "I'm sorry for being so much trouble."<p></p>
        "…Well, if you're going to be trouble anyway, you might as well go all the way."<p></p>
        "But… What you were saying earlier…"<p></p>
        "That was that, and this is this."<p></p>
        "Oh…?"<p></p>
        He wasn't sure what Mahiru meant, but she certainly seemed to have something in<p></p>
        mind, so far be it from Amane to argue.<p></p>
        If Mahiru thought he seemed troublesome, then he probably was. But he didn't know<p></p>
        how to respond when she told him to up the ante.<p></p>
        "I can be crafty, too, you know," Mahiru said. "So I suppose I really don't have much<p></p>
        room to complain."<p></p>
        "In what way, Mahiru?"<p></p>
        "Hmm, I wonder?"<p></p>
        He felt her body tremble slightly with laughter.<p></p>
        "If you haven't realized yet that I also have a few tricks up my sleeve, you still have a<p></p>
        long way to go, Amane." 1<p></p>
        Even though Amane couldn't see her face, it was clear she was laughing gleefully.<p></p>
        Gracefully, she slipped out of his arms and whirled around to face him.<p></p>
        Her expression when she did was vibrant, and mischievous, and tender, and sweet—<p></p>
        a lovely and beautiful smile that would enchant anyone who saw it. Amane was<p></p>
        speechless.<p></p>
        When she saw Amane like that, Mahiru seemed satisfied, and she turned and headed<p></p>
        for the kitchen in her usual high spirits.<p></p>
        Amane watched her leave the room and then collapsed onto the sofa.<p></p>
        …You're a big dummy, too, you know.<p></p>
        What was she trying to do, flashing him a look like that? He didn't think he could string<p></p>
        together the words to ask her. All he could do was sit there, grumbling quietly.<p></p>
        But the pain in the depths of his chest was gone.<p></p>
        Chapter 38: Parental Concern and a Passing Pain<p></p>
        …Mom, you can't just send Mahiru photos like that."<p></p>
        On the last day of Golden Week, Amane phoned his mother.<p></p>
        He was ostensibly calling to ask whether she would be at home on Mother's Day, but<p></p>
        before he could do that, he felt the need to stress his objection to her going behind his<p></p>
        back to send Mahiru photos of him. Nothing disastrous had slipped through the cracks<p></p>
        just yet, but this was his mother he was dealing with, and he knew if Mahiru asked,<p></p>
        she would absolutely send something mortifying.<p></p>
        So Amane rushed through the typical greetings and right into sullenly hurling<p></p>
        accusations.<p></p>
        "Uh-oh, you caught me," his mother replied in an indifferent tone.<p></p>
        She definitely was not remorseful.<p></p>
        "Mahiru was acting suspicious, so I questioned her, and then I saw the photos."<p></p>
        "Mahiru really needs to work on her poker face, huh?"<p></p>
        "Say you're sorry for sending them."<p></p>
        Thanks to Shihoko, Mahiru's image folder was full of all kinds of strange pictures, and<p></p>
        he was worried what else might make its way to her. For some reason, Mahiru seemed<p></p>
        to enjoy the photos, and rather than forcing her to stop looking at them, he had<p></p>
        decided it would be faster to go right to the root of the problem.<p></p>
        But his mother didn't seem the least bit ashamed. "What's so wrong about sending<p></p>
        photos of my adorable son to my adorable future daughter-in-law?"<p></p>
        "I don't even know where to start correcting everything wrong with that sentence…<p></p>
        Anyway, don't send stuff I haven't okayed."<p></p>
        "So if I get your permission, it's fine, right? The photos made Mahiru very happy, you<p></p>
        know."<p></p>
        "At least give me a chance to choose which ones you can send. I'd die if I found out<p></p>
        you'd sent anything embarrassing."<p></p>
        "Don't worry, I won't send any pictures of you in the bath."<p></p>
        "If you do, I'm boycotting Mother's Day." Amane scowled at his smartphone as he<p></p>
        delivered his ultimatum. His mother wasn't on hand to feel his wrath directly, so that<p></p>
        would have to do.<p></p>
        She obviously did not appreciate how upset he was, because she laughed gaily at his<p></p>
        demand. Before Amane could raise his eyebrows and go off on her again, she added,<p></p>
        "One way or another, you always show your appreciation for me every year, don't you?"<p></p>
        When Amane heard that, he held back his complaints.<p></p>
        "…I mean, yeah, you're my mom."<p></p>
        Of course, she could be irritating and obstinate, and sometimes he got completely fed<p></p>
        up with her, but his mother had carried him in her belly, given birth to him, lovingly<p></p>
        raised him to be healthy—and she did it all with plenty of love, so naturally he was<p></p>
        grateful to her.<p></p>
        Thanks to his parents, Amane had grown up okay and had rebounded whenever he'd<p></p>
        gotten hurt. He had turned out a little sulky, though.<p></p>
        But since it was embarrassing for a young man of his age to express gratitude directly<p></p>
        to his mother's face, he faltered a little.<p></p>
        His mother laughed cheerfully, as if she could see straight through her son. "It makes<p></p>
        a mother happy to see that she's raised a good child. I'm looking forward to this year's<p></p>
        flowers."<p></p>
        "…Yeah."<p></p>
        "Also, make sure you invite sweet Mahiru here for the summer, okay? I'm looking<p></p>
        forward to it."<p></p>
        His mother was obviously excited for his homecoming.<p></p>
        "Got it," Amane replied curtly, and he was treated to another laugh. "Well, Mahiru wants<p></p>
        to come anyway," he continued. "It seems like she's looking forward to it as well."<p></p>
        "It sounds like you are, too, Amane."<p></p>
        "Oh, be quiet."<p></p>
        He was excited about the prospect of spending the summer with Mahiru, but he didn't<p></p>
        appreciate being teased about it by his own mother.<p></p>
        Suddenly, Amane was in a bad mood, but Shihoko didn't seem to notice. On the other<p></p>
        end of the line, he could hear the peals of her cheerful laughter.<p></p>
        "Heh-heh. That's great. It sounds like you're okay with the idea of returning home."<p></p>
        "…I guess so."<p></p>
        She was probably thinking of the summer after his first year away, when he had<p></p>
        resisted going home during the break.<p></p>
        Now Amane was more positive about going home than he had once been. It wasn't<p></p>
        that he had forgotten the past. Even though he had experienced certain hardships, he<p></p>
        could see now that it had probably been for the best. Things were much better than<p></p>
        they would have been if he had stayed so trusting and good-natured, thus inevitably<p></p>
        exploited for all he was worth. More importantly, if he hadn't escaped those guys, he<p></p>
        never would have met Mahiru.<p></p>
        "If I let what happened derail my life any more than it already has, Mahiru would kill<p></p>
        me. So yeah, it pretty much doesn't bother me anymore."<p></p>
        "You told Mahiru?"<p></p>
        "Yeah."<p></p>
        "That's wonderful. That's one more person who really understands you."<p></p>
        His mother sounded very happy, and Amane felt his chest grow just a little bit warm.<p></p>
        "…Sure."<p></p>
        "So that must mean those photos of you from middle school I had held back on sending<p></p>
        are fair game. I've got one from when you hit your growth spurt. You looked so smug<p></p>
        because you'd gotten taller than me. And that's just the beginning!"<p></p>
        "Hey, listen, I'm not kidding. Cut it out, all right? You've got some awful stuff in reserve."<p></p>
        All the warm feelings he'd had toward his mother evaporated.<p></p>
        "But you were so cuuute!"<p></p>
        "Dammit. This time, when I come home, I'm taking those out of the album."<p></p>
        "I've got that album hidden," Shihoko countered. "So they'll be fine."<p></p>
        "I'm definitely going to find it," he insisted.<p></p>
        He had to dispose of the photos before Mahiru saw them. He could just imagine Mahiru<p></p>
        grinning as she told him what she thought of them after his mother smuggled them<p></p>
        into her hands behind his back.<p></p>
        He could hear Shihoko laughing at him on the other end of the line, and with a curt<p></p>
        good-bye, he hung up on her, sighing angrily.<p></p>
        "…What are you doing?" a quiet voice asked. He turned to see Mahiru, peeking<p></p>
        inquisitively at him from the living room door. It looked like she had heard him talking<p></p>
        and tried not to make any noise as she entered the apartment.<p></p>
        Amane averted his eyes. "I was talking to my mom, telling her how I've decided to<p></p>
        completely destroy her photo albums. Scorched earth."<p></p>
        "Wh-what do you mean?! That'd be awful!" she exclaimed. She sat down next to him<p></p>
        in an angry huff and jabbed him in the shoulder.<p></p>
        Amane grimaced. "What are you even hoping to see, Mahiru…?"<p></p>
        "Photos of you, from long ago, of course…"<p></p>
        "No way."<p></p>
        "…You see? I have no choice but to get them from Shihoko, behind your back."<p></p>
        "Hey, listen—"<p></p>
        "I'm just joking. Well, half joking anyway."<p></p>
        "Geez… It's the other half that worries me, you know."<p></p>
        Amane couldn't help but feel like if he dropped the matter, Mahiru would end up<p></p>
        plotting something with his mother behind his back. On the other hand, Mahiru was a<p></p>
        good person, and he trusted that, whatever happened, she wouldn't do anything too<p></p>
        outrageous.<p></p>
        Amane sighed dramatically, but Mahiru didn't seem bothered by it. Instead, she smiled<p></p>
        broadly, looking pleased. "…I don't think you're going to like this much, but I'm really<p></p>
        looking forward to summer vacation."<p></p>
        "You're kinda early," Amane replied. "Golden Week isn't even over yet."<p></p>
        "Well… I'm looking forward to seeing your mother and father again, and I can't wait to<p></p>
        check out your photo album, and I really want to see the place where you grew up with<p></p>
        my own eyes."<p></p>
        Amane felt his heart leap as she adorably rattled off her list, but she had added in one<p></p>
        item too many.<p></p>
        "Thanks… except for the album thing. The album is off-limits."<p></p>
        Mahiru gave him a peevish look when he shut her down, so he stroked her head to<p></p>
        distract her from the existence of the cursed photo album.<p></p>
        Mahiru apparently liked having her head stroked more than he had ever expected. She<p></p>
        still looked a tiny bit dissatisfied, but when he gently touched the top layer of her hair,<p></p>
        careful not to mess it up, she quickly settled down.<p></p>
        "…I'm looking forward to going home, too," Amane admitted.<p></p>
        "Really?" she asked.<p></p>
        "Why would I lie about that?"<p></p>
        "…I mean, with everything that happened…" Mahiru hesitated, probably recalling what<p></p>
        he had revealed to her yesterday.<p></p>
        "That thing with those guys doesn't really bother me anymore. Just the fact that you're<p></p>
        upset about something that happened to me really means a lot. How do I put this—? I<p></p>
        think I'm a pretty lucky guy to have someone who's willing to get genuinely angry on<p></p>
        my behalf."<p></p>
        He knew it was a small, simple thing, but just having someone who listened to him talk<p></p>
        about those old wounds—and be there to support him—had already gone a long way<p></p>
        toward helping him heal.<p></p>
        Besides, it was clear he couldn't carry on being depressed about it. Sooner or later, he<p></p>
        would exhaust Mahiru's patience with him, and he didn't want her to think he was<p></p>
        completely hopeless.<p></p>
        "It's only natural that I would be angry you were hurt, Amane. I mean, if someone was<p></p>
        to hurt me, you would be angry, right?"<p></p>
        "Of course I would."<p></p>
        "So it's the same thing," Mahiru asserted softly, letting her eyes drift closed. Amane<p></p>
        could tell how much she enjoyed it when he stroked her hair.<p></p>
        Amane felt a little embarrassed by how much she trusted him, but he continued gently<p></p>
        caressing her, and she smiled graciously and leaned against him.<p></p>
        Chapter 39: A Premonition of Trouble After the Holidays<p></p>
        Golden Week, which had seemed both very long and painfully short, eventually came<p></p>
        to a close, and school began again.<p></p>
        …Finally, I can get some distance from Mahiru.<p></p>
        Mahiru had spent nearly the entire Golden Week at Amane's apartment. He'd said it<p></p>
        was okay, was grateful she had made their delicious meals, and was happy to spend<p></p>
        time with the girl he loved.<p></p>
        But ever since the day Amane had told Mahiru about his troubled past, his feelings for<p></p>
        her had only grown, and now he found it almost impossible to calm his turbulent<p></p>
        emotions.<p></p>
        Mahiru trusted Amane wholeheartedly. She spoiled him, certainly, but in a way she<p></p>
        also took advantage of him, testing the limits of his emotional fortitude. And knowing<p></p>
        he was the only one allowed to touch her sent his feelings into overdrive.<p></p>
        Really, he thought, I deserve some kind of award for self-control. If only I didn't have to<p></p>
        hold back, I bet I could ask her out. I might even get a good answer—<p></p>
        Mahiru had been so accepting of Amane, but he knew he didn't have the guts to tell<p></p>
        her how he felt. Just the thought of her rejection made him want to curl up and die. He<p></p>
        knew he was a coward, too afraid to make a move. But perhaps he was even more<p></p>
        afraid of what might happen if she didn't reject him, if by some chance she felt the<p></p>
        same way about him. He didn't think he was good enough to be her boyfriend.<p></p>
        …I've got a lot of work to do.<p></p>
        There wasn't anything he could do about his face, but he wanted to improve himself<p></p>
        wherever he could—physically and mentally. At least enough so no one would talk<p></p>
        behind their backs when he was with her—enough so Mahiru wouldn't be ashamed<p></p>
        of being with him.<p></p>
        And even if it turned out Mahiru didn't like him that way, it didn't hurt to try. He'd<p></p>
        never get anywhere if he didn't give it his best.<p></p>
        As he made up his mind to ask Yuuta, the lean, athletic track-and-field star, for some<p></p>
        training recommendations, Amane passed through the school gates and reached the<p></p>
        shoe lockers, where he caught sight of a familiar face.<p></p>
        "Mornin'…" Itsuki was groggily changing into his indoor slippers. He gave a puzzled<p></p>
        frown when he saw Amane. "…What's with that face?"<p></p>
        "That's my line," Amane said. "And anyway, what face?"<p></p>
        "Well, umm… How do I put this? You look like you've made a big decision. You finally<p></p>
        decide to tell her how you feel?"<p></p>
        Amane gave Itsuki an incredulous look. "Hmph. Yeah, right!" But his friend hadn't been<p></p>
        that far off the mark.<p></p>
        Itsuki stared at him with genuine curiosity. "Huh, well then, what is it? I thought there<p></p>
        would have been some kind of progress by now."<p></p>
        "P-progress? All right, look—"<p></p>
        "I was sure you'd finally grown a pair and decided to approach her like a man for a<p></p>
        change."<p></p>
        "Damn, no need to be an ass! Anyway… I was just thinking about how I have a lot of<p></p>
        work to do if I'm ever gonna get her to like me back."<p></p>
        "Hmm. In other words, over the break, after we went to karaoke… something did<p></p>
        happen! You're really going for it, eh?!" Itsuki chuckled.<p></p>
        Amane couldn't think of a clever comeback.<p></p>
        Itsuki slapped his friend on the back as he laughed. "Well, I know you hate me prying,<p></p>
        so I'll let you off the hook… But if there's anything I can help you with, I will, okay?"<p></p>
        "Itsuki…"<p></p>
        "And we can think about double dates, okay?"<p></p>
        "Ah, so that's what you're really after," Amane joked. He knew Itsuki was only trying to<p></p>
        lighten the mood.<p></p>
        Itsuki cackled and smacked Amane's back again. "Yeah, that's the dream, huh…?" 1<p></p>
        Humor was Itsuki's way of cheering him up.<p></p>
        Amane smiled at his friend, feeling just a little bit more optimistic. "Whatever you say,<p></p>
        man."<p></p>
        When Amane and Itsuki reached their classroom, there was some kind of clamor going<p></p>
        on. The commotion wasn't directed at the two of them, but the lively atmosphere was<p></p>
        so different from normal that Amane couldn't hide his bewilderment.<p></p>
        After a long break, it was normal for the classroom to be bustling with stories of<p></p>
        vacation, but today it was filled with a different kind of noise—the bustle of people<p></p>
        passing rumors. Amane strained his ears to listen in as he unloaded his bags at his<p></p>
        seat—and it seemed they were all discussing Mahiru.<p></p>
        "I heard that Shiina went on a date the other day with a cool-looking guy!"<p></p>
        What he overheard made Amane's cheek twitch violently.<p></p>
        They'd gone to crowded places, so there had always been a possibility that someone<p></p>
        would see them. But Amane had never imagined it would literally become the talk of<p></p>
        the classroom. He didn't mind the part about looking cool, but the rest of it immediately<p></p>
        set him on edge.<p></p>
        Itsuki had obviously overheard the same thing and was sitting there doing a very bad<p></p>
        job of not smiling. Amane would have liked to give him a good punch in the arm.<p></p>
        As they whispered about the rumors, all the girls kept glancing over at Mahiru.<p></p>
        "I heard they were strolling around arm in arm, and she was wearing a smile no one's<p></p>
        ever seen at school before… It must have been the guy everyone was talking about at<p></p>
        the start of the year."<p></p>
        "She says she's not dating anyone, but there's no doubt now…"<p></p>
        Mahiru, who had come to school early, as always, was preparing for first period. She<p></p>
        either didn't realize the rumors were about her, or more likely, she did realize and was<p></p>
        trying to ignore them.<p></p>
        She had to be used to the attention, thanks to her beauty and grace, but that day there<p></p>
        were more than the usual number of eyes peering in her direction, filled with<p></p>
        questions. And aside from the curious stares of the girls, she was getting looks of dead<p></p>
        despair from the boys.<p></p>
        If it bothered Mahiru, she certainly didn't show it. She stubbornly maintained her<p></p>
        usual angelic demeanor.<p></p>
        Eventually, a few of the girls in the class couldn't contain their curiosity any longer and<p></p>
        gingerly approached her.<p></p>
        "Hey, hey, Shiina?" one of the girls asked timidly.<p></p>
        Mahiru slowly batted her eyes. "Yes, did you need something?" She was acting like she<p></p>
        had no idea what the girls wanted.<p></p>
        "Well, the other day, I think I saw you walking through the shopping mall with a guy."<p></p>
        "Yes, I did walk through the mall," Mahiru confirmed.<p></p>
        A wave of murmuring went through the class. Obviously, everyone had been wondering<p></p>
        if the rumors were true. Amane, at the center of the scandal, felt sick to his stomach.<p></p>
        "Um, so that guy… What kind of relationship…?"<p></p>
        "What kind of relationship do we have?" Mahiru interrupted. "Well, if I had to say, I<p></p>
        think calling us friends would describe it best."<p></p>
        Amane was glad Mahiru had answered honestly, but his stomach still felt like it was<p></p>
        tied in knots. His classmates continued to mutter among themselves. He wished they<p></p>
        would all just mind their own business, but there was little he could do about it. Several<p></p>
        of the other boys in class seemed very relieved by Mahiru's answer, undoubtedly for<p></p>
        different reasons than Amane.<p></p>
        "So it wasn't a date or anything?"<p></p>
        "A date…?" Mahiru thought for a moment. "Well, when I consider the definition of a<p></p>
        date, I think it counts."<p></p>
        It was not the answer he had been expecting. In the strictest sense, a date was when<p></p>
        two or more people picked a place and time to meet up, so she wasn't exactly wrong…<p></p>
        But it was pretty obvious that was not what the girls had meant.<p></p>
        The small crowd shrieked as their excitement peaked.<p></p>
        From Amane's perspective, it seemed like since time immemorial, girls loved getting<p></p>
        excited about other people's love affairs. Normally he didn't concern himself with that<p></p>
        kind of chatter, figuring it was just what girls did. But this time, he couldn't ignore their<p></p>
        gossip—because he was at the center of it.<p></p>
        "S-so what are you saying…?"<p></p>
        The same girl who had asked the previous questions inquired again. Her voice<p></p>
        trembled with a mix of curiosity and hope.<p></p>
        Mahiru glanced at Amane for a split second. That look, gentle but filled with hints of<p></p>
        passion, left him momentarily breathless. By the time he got ahold of himself, Mahiru<p></p>
        had already turned away.<p></p>
        Now Mahiru wore a gentle smile, full of warmth and affection, and clasped her hands<p></p>
        in front of her breast, as if she were tightly holding on to something very precious. Her<p></p>
        answer sent the class into chaos, and it shook Amane to his core.<p></p>
        "We're not dating, but to me… he is the most important person on earth."<br>

        Chapter 40: The Angel’s Thoughts<p></p>
        "We're not dating, but to me… he is the most important person on earth."<p></p>
        Mahiru had made that statement publicly, in front of their classmates. For the rest of<p></p>
        the day, Amane couldn't think about anything else or pay attention in class. He just<p></p>
        didn't know exactly what she'd meant by "important." Did she mean that they were<p></p>
        good friends, or affectionately close, or maybe—in a romantic sense? 1<p></p>
        The more he thought about it, the more anxiety and unease he felt, but the faintest<p></p>
        hope swirled in his chest. All day, he was overwhelmed by emotions he could not put<p></p>
        into words.<p></p>
        His friend Itsuki smiled at him, but didn't make any jokes or say anything about it.<p></p>
        Amane had little hope of figuring out what Mahiru was thinking on his own. He spent<p></p>
        the whole day irritated, wishing he could just ask her directly what she'd meant. But<p></p>
        he never got the chance at school.<p></p>
        When the two of them got back to Amane's apartment, he finally, timidly, asked<p></p>
        Mahiru.<p></p>
        She looked at him with a puzzled expression. "I wasn't lying, you know," she said<p></p>
        without hesitation. It sounded like she had no idea why he was asking.<p></p>
        Mahiru put on her apron to prepare dinner. She also put on a little smile, perhaps<p></p>
        aware of Amane's discomfort. "I'm fairly sociable, but my circle of friends is small. The<p></p>
        only people I can definitely say I'm close with are you, Chitose, and Akazawa. Of course,<p></p>
        all of you are important to me, but among the three of you, you're the one I'm closest<p></p>
        with and the one I feel most at ease with when we're together."<p></p>
        "Oh, um…"<p></p>
        Amane knew that what Mahiru was saying was true, but being told this face-to-face<p></p>
        felt very strange for some reason.<p></p>
        "We've spent the past half year or so together, and it has been a very meaningful time<p></p>
        for me. I've never been the type to get close to others, and you're the most comfortable,<p></p>
        most likable person I know," she said calmly and candidly.<p></p>
        Amane suppressed a groan as he looked into Mahiru's gentle eyes. She gazed back at<p></p>
        him.<p></p>
        "For me, the world is a small place," she continued. "I could count the people I like on<p></p>
        one hand, as if I'm living in a miniature garden… In my little world, you are the most<p></p>
        precious person to me. You're the one who told me that I'm okay just the way I am."<p></p>
        "Mahiru…"<p></p>
        "So I want you to be a little more confident in that regard, Amane."<p></p>
        Mahiru's cheeks reddened, coloring her shy expression, clearly showing that she was<p></p>
        stating her true feelings, but Mahiru didn't seem to notice.<p></p>
        The sincerity painted on her face caused conflicting emotions to well up inside<p></p>
        Amane—embarrassment and indescribable joy threatened to make his chest burst.<p></p>
        "After all, you already know that I trust you above anyone else. Did you think that there<p></p>
        was someone else that I liked?"<p></p>
        "That's not it, but… when you put it that way, you must have known how I would take<p></p>
        it, right?"<p></p>
        "That's exactly right," Mahiru answered with an unwavering smile.<p></p>
        Amane stared at Mahiru. "So when you dodged the question that way, you knew it<p></p>
        would open us up to insistent prying and suspicions of romance?"<p></p>
        Mahiru's smile broadened. She was oddly nonchalant. "That's also right."<p></p>
        "In that case, wouldn't it have been easier to manage the rumors by letting out a few<p></p>
        snippets of information at a slow trickle? If people are going to speculate, I think it<p></p>
        would be better to at least have some control over the direction the rumors take."<p></p>
        "…Indeed."<p></p>
        Amane knew that Mahiru had her own ways of thinking about these things, but to him,<p></p>
        it had been extraordinarily nerve-racking to hear her talk about him in public, even<p></p>
        indirectly.<p></p>
        In the end, there had been a big uproar after her statement, but Mahiru herself had<p></p>
        just calmly put on her angelic smile. The boys in love with Mahiru were probably<p></p>
        stressing out about it right now.<p></p>
        "Anyway, you should be more careful. If you don't say anything to me beforehand, I<p></p>
        might get the wrong idea, too."<p></p>
        "Get the wrong idea?"<p></p>
        "…Usually, if someone said something like that about me, I'd think what everyone else<p></p>
        is thinking."<p></p>
        Amane figured that Mahiru must like him in some way. Otherwise, she wouldn't be so<p></p>
        relaxed around him, or look at him with such trust in her eyes. But he couldn't figure<p></p>
        out the exact nature of her affection.<p></p>
        Was it the same kind of sentiment that Amane felt toward Mahiru, or was it something<p></p>
        more passionate?<p></p>
        The feelings he held were not something that he could easily put into words.<p></p>
        He didn't feel burning-hot passion, and it wasn't intense, heartrending yearning,<p></p>
        either. It was more like a quiet, gentle candle giving off a steady heat. Mahiru was the<p></p>
        first person for whom his heart had felt such affection and desire to treasure.<p></p>
        However, those weren't the kind of feelings that most friends of the opposite sex could<p></p>
        just openly talk about. Also, Amane didn't know if Mahiru felt the same way. For this<p></p>
        reason, he reminded himself to speak clearly, so as not to be misunderstood.<p></p>
        "I mean, if for example I were to announce that you were someone important to me,<p></p>
        with that kind of timing, you'd start getting ideas too, right?"<p></p>
        "But I don't think you would ever make such a declaration in the first place, Amane."<p></p>
        "Well, that's true, but—"<p></p>
        "Or are you saying that's what you're going to do?"<p></p>
        "I know that if I did, I'd wind up feeling like I decided to sit down on a bed of thorns."<p></p>
        I know for sure that people's thorny gazes would skewer me—no, they'd eviscerate me. I<p></p>
        would die by a thousand stares.<p></p>
        Amane waved his hand in front of his face. He had no intention of resigning himself to<p></p>
        such a fate without any sort of preparation.<p></p>
        Mahiru let a little giggle slip out.<p></p>
        "I know you're not the risk-taking type."<p></p>
        "…Somehow, I feel like that annoys you."<p></p>
        "You're imagining things."<p></p>
        Amane was pretty sure he was not imagining the look of exasperation on Mahiru's<p></p>
        face, but it seemed she didn't feel like explaining anything to him.<p></p>
        Mahiru let out a deep sigh, as if to vent her frustrations, and headed for the kitchen.<p></p>
        "…Um?"<p></p>
        "What is it?"<p></p>
        "If I did make some kind of public declaration, I think it would have a big effect on your<p></p>
        life, too… Are you prepared for that?"<p></p>
        "What a silly question. I would never suggest something if I wasn't ready to deal with<p></p>
        the consequences."<p></p>
        Amane was at a loss for words because she really said it without a second thought.<p></p>
        Mahiru didn't so much as look his way and started setting out her cooking utensils<p></p>
        with a flourish of her apron hem.<p></p>
        "I understand that my social standing is different from yours, and that we receive very<p></p>
        different kinds of attention. I also understand that you won't say anything. And I don't<p></p>
        want to make you uncomfortable."<p></p>
        "…That's—"<p></p>
        "It's a real pain to be popular, you know. People are always watching how you act in<p></p>
        public and meddling in your affairs."<p></p>
        Mahiru grumbled to herself, and it was plain to see she was fed up with the attention.<p></p>
        Then she turned around to look at Amane.<p></p>
        "But here, it's just the two of us; there's no one to butt in. For now, I'm satisfied with<p></p>
        that."<p></p>
        Mahiru smiled coyly, and Amane couldn't do anything but stare at her beautiful smile,<p></p>
        unable to say anything more.<p></p>
        Chapter 41: The Angel’s Risky Proposal<p></p>
        A new day had dawned since Mahiru's shocking statement, but the excitement over<p></p>
        the angel's new relationship hadn't settled down at all in class.<p></p>
        Her words had attracted considerable curiosity, since up to now, she hadn't shown any<p></p>
        interest in boys and had treated members of both sexes the same.<p></p>
        However, no matter what she was asked, Mahiru didn't answer with any additional<p></p>
        information. Her closest friend, Chitose, also insisted that she didn't know anything,<p></p>
        so whoever Mahiru had alluded to remained unknown.<p></p>
        As the boy in question, Amane was relieved by this, but at the same time, he was<p></p>
        terrified, wondering when he would be exposed.<p></p>
        "Well, I think if someone got a reeeally good look at your face, they'd figure it out. But<p></p>
        from a distance, just looking at your silhouette, I doubt anyone would recognize you,"<p></p>
        Itsuki said, laughing at Amane's concern as he looked over the merchandise for sale.<p></p>
        Amane had brought Itsuki and Yuuta along with him to the sports equipment store. 3<p></p>
        He was there to buy some exercise gear, after deciding that he should start training<p></p>
        and exercising to better complement Mahiru, and so that she might fall for him. The<p></p>
        impact of her statement had sparked the idea.<p></p>
        Club activities were suspended for the time being due to upcoming exams, so the track<p></p>
        and field club ace had some free time and accompanied Amane to help him pick out<p></p>
        running shoes.<p></p>
        "I mean, after all, you usually have a plain hairstyle and act all indifferent, so you come<p></p>
        off as cold, and your expression doesn't really change," Itsuki said. "But when you're<p></p>
        with her, you make all sorts of faces, and you actually look up from the ground, so you<p></p>
        seem sweet and gentle. I don't think anyone would connect that guy with the Amane<p></p>
        we see at school."<p></p>
        "You're pretty easy to read, Fujimiya; it's surprising," Yuuta added.<p></p>
        "Shut up."<p></p>
        Amane was aware that he acted more gently toward Mahiru than other people, but it<p></p>
        was still embarrassing to hear someone point it out like that.<p></p>
        It was all the more humiliating to know that even Yuuta, who he had just started<p></p>
        hanging out with, could see it.<p></p>
        Amane frowned, trying to shake off the embarrassment. Itsuki looked at him with a<p></p>
        foolish grin.<p></p>
        "Looks like my prediction was right, that you would change when you found a girl you<p></p>
        liked."<p></p>
        "…Shut up."<p></p>
        "Oooh, you are sooo cute when you're trying not to look embarrassed, Amane!"<p></p>
        "Don't be a creep, Itsuki."<p></p>
        "It is a little creepy, Itsuki."<p></p>
        "Why are you on his side, Yuuta? You're supposed to stick with me."<p></p>
        "Well, it's… you know."<p></p>
        "I'm gonna cry, guys."<p></p>
        Itsuki did not seem like he was going to cry at all. After grinning and poking at Amane<p></p>
        for a while, he shrugged. "Well, I guess she really does have all sorts of troubles of her<p></p>
        own, huh? Including yesterday's performance."<p></p>
        "…Performance? She told me she did it to control the rumors as best she could without<p></p>
        telling any lies, since she was under suspicion anyway."<p></p>
        "Ah, is that how she explained it? Well, that's all true, but I think it was also an attempt<p></p>
        to repel other guys without inviting hostility from other girls. When you're popular,<p></p>
        you're always the object of jealousy, more or less. By hinting that she's got a special<p></p>
        someone, and that she hasn't got eyes for anyone else, she's saying that even if she<p></p>
        hangs around Yuuta and us once in a while, she's not interested."<p></p>
        "I see."<p></p>
        "Plus, you know, to keep it all in check."<p></p>
        "What do you mean?"<p></p>
        "…Ah, it's nothing. Forget it. Setting all that aside, I can see in your eyes that she's<p></p>
        important to you, and I think she probably feels the same way. You can win her over if<p></p>
        you push, or even better, push her down, heh? It's important for a guy to take a little<p></p>
        initiative, you know!"<p></p>
        The words "push her down" made Amane recall the situation that happened over<p></p>
        Golden Week.<p></p>
        I didn't mean to…<p></p>
        By accident, he had lost his balance and fallen on top of her. It wasn't anything<p></p>
        intentional. There was no way he would have done it on purpose, being fully aware<p></p>
        that Mahiru would hate him if he did something as outrageous as that.<p></p>
        However, if Mahiru made the same expression next time, looking like she was waiting<p></p>
        for him to make some sort of move—he wasn't sure what he'd do then.<p></p>
        "…Hey, did something happen that I don't know about? Did you get lucky or<p></p>
        something?"<p></p>
        Itsuki made a grabbing motion with his hands, very interested now that Amane's<p></p>
        cheeks were gradually flushing with remembered shame.<p></p>
        "Just shut up for once!" Amane shouted.<p></p>
        "Itsuki, you're the worst!" Yuuta added.<p></p>
        "Whose side are you on, anyway?! I thought you were hoping for progress, Yuuta!"<p></p>
        "I don't want to be on your side when you're messing around like that. Though I do<p></p>
        think that Fujimiya is being too passive."<p></p>
        "As far as I can tell, you're both against me."<p></p>
        Amane had complex feelings about getting these evaluations from Yuuta and Itsuki.<p></p>
        On the other hand, he knew he wasn't particularly assertive, so he didn't feel like he<p></p>
        could make much of a rebuttal.<p></p>
        "Now, now, we just wanted to give you a little nudge," Yuuta insisted. "I don't know<p></p>
        Mahiru that well, so I'm just speculating, but I doubt she has feelings for anyone other<p></p>
        than you, Fujimiya. It seems like you're the only one she really trusts. After all, she<p></p>
        seems incredibly wary of most people. I'm telling you, the way that girl looks at you,<p></p>
        and only you, is different."<p></p>
        "…I know that she trusts me, and that she likes me as a person, but even so…"<p></p>
        "Why are you so negative? Have some confidence. You're a good guy, and you seem like<p></p>
        the kind of person who can put in some serious effort, so long as you have a goal. I<p></p>
        mean, look, if you really don't have any confidence, then start working out and get in<p></p>
        shape. Physical fitness is linked to emotional well-being, you know. If your body gets<p></p>
        fitter, your attitude should improve, and if your attitude improves, everything around<p></p>
        you will look brighter. By getting physically stronger, you can make yourself more<p></p>
        confident."<p></p>
        "You sound awfully self-assured."<p></p>
        "I read it in a book."<p></p>
        Yuuta seemed amused at reciting something he saw in a book once and passing it off<p></p>
        as if speaking from his own experience. He laughed playfully and clapped Amane on<p></p>
        the shoulder. "Well, you're tall, Fujimiya, so you'd look good if you filled out a little,<p></p>
        looked a little more balanced, you know? It would be a waste not to cultivate the good<p></p>
        features you were born with."<p></p>
        "…I'll try my best."<p></p>
        "You've got Yuuta to help you with the physical part, and me for the emotional part,"<p></p>
        Itsuki said. "The dream team!"<p></p>
        "I'm a little apprehensive about your advice…"<p></p>
        "How rude!"<p></p>
        "Just kidding… I trust you, somewhat."<p></p>
        "This guy just can't be honest with his feelings."<p></p>
        Itsuki ribbed Amane with his elbow. Amane deliberately ignored his very existence<p></p>
        and shifted his gaze back to Yuuta, who was smiling beside him.<p></p>
        Amane had already tried on and chosen some shoes, as well as the other things he<p></p>
        needed. Figuring they would be in the way if they lingered too long in the store, he<p></p>
        held up the merchandise in his hands to suggest that they hurry to the cashier.<p></p>
        "Kadowaki, should we go pay?"<p></p>
        "I guess you could. I thought I might get some new running wear, too."<p></p>
        "Isn't it a little cruel to ignore me, guys?"<p></p>
        Itsuki knew what they were up to, and shouted after them in a slightly disheartened<p></p>
        voice as they headed for the registers. Amane and Yuuta looked at each other and<p></p>
        laughed a little.<p></p>
        "…So what that means is, I'm going to do a little more exercise, so that will probably<p></p>
        increase the amount of time I'm out of the house."<p></p>
        After getting home and devouring the entire dinner that Mahiru had made, Amane<p></p>
        told her that he was going to be around the house less often.<p></p>
        Although his training would be something he did by himself, he figured that it would<p></p>
        inconvenience her if he didn't say anything, since they spent a lot of time together and<p></p>
        since she was in charge of fixing dinner.<p></p>
        Mahiru, who was relaxing comfortably on the sofa after dinner as usual, widened her<p></p>
        caramel-coloured eyes in slight surprise at Amane's words.<p></p>
        "I'll adjust the menu to account for exercise, but… this is quite sudden. Exercising is<p></p>
        good, but what prompted this?"<p></p>
        "…I guess I just wanted to improve myself a little more, as a guy," Amane deflected.<p></p>
        Naturally, there was no way he could tell her openly that it was because he wanted her<p></p>
        approval, or that he wanted to look as good as she did, or that he wanted her to find<p></p>
        him attractive.<p></p>
        Mahiru's laughing rang like a clear and beautiful bell. "My goodness, that's a line I<p></p>
        never thought I'd hear from the Amane who was living a slovenly life until half a year<p></p>
        ago."<p></p>
        "Come on, don't make fun of me… There's no harm in focusing more on my studies, my<p></p>
        fitness, or my appearance."<p></p>
        "Well, that's true, but…"<p></p>
        Amane let his eyes wander. Mahiru's gaze implied that she was surprised to hear<p></p>
        something like this coming from him, but she didn't seem like she was going to<p></p>
        question him any further.<p></p>
        Mahiru had an exasperated but somewhat charming smile, and she poked Amane's<p></p>
        cheek with her fingertip teasingly.<p></p>
        "…Just don't overdo it, all right? You're an overachiever, Amane. I know that once you<p></p>
        decide to do something, you follow through, so please ask someone for help if it looks<p></p>
        like you might get carried away."<p></p>
        "I'm not worried about that. I've got a trainer."<p></p>
        "Kadowaki?"<p></p>
        "He's not an actual instructor, but he can teach me all sorts of basic things."<p></p>
        "I guess that makes me your personal chef. I'll think carefully about nutritional<p></p>
        balance when I make your meals."<p></p>
        If Amane was going to start exercising and getting in shape, then naturally he would<p></p>
        need to change his diet, too. Since he was already skinny, he knew he needed to put on<p></p>
        some weight, which meant eating more in general. That in turn meant more work for<p></p>
        Mahiru.<p></p>
        Amane knew he depended on Mahiru for most of his meals, so he felt bad about asking<p></p>
        even more from her, but she accepted the challenge without so much as a sour look.<p></p>
        "Sorry for causing you all sorts of trouble."<p></p>
        "No, if you've made up your mind, I'll be glad to help and cheer you on, but… you<p></p>
        mustn't forget that first we have exams to get through, all right?"<p></p>
        "I haven't forgotten. I've been reviewing every day."<p></p>
        "That's great."<p></p>
        Amane couldn't summon the willpower to shake her off as she patted his head and 1<p></p>
        praised him in a soft voice that oozed sweetness.<p></p>
        But he also had mixed feelings about not putting up any resistance, so he shot her a<p></p>
        slightly reproachful look.<p></p>
        "…Don't make fun of me. I'm perfectly capable of balancing my studies with my<p></p>
        training."<p></p>
        Amane was earnest by nature and took his classes seriously. He was the type who<p></p>
        could mostly grasp the material just by sitting through the lesson. Since he also never<p></p>
        failed to review and prepare at home, he basically had no worries when it came to<p></p>
        academics.<p></p>
        He wouldn't be neglecting his studies just by diverting a little of that energy to<p></p>
        exercise. In fact, he intended to get more serious about his studies as well. He was<p></p>
        determined not to fall behind in either department, lest he fail to keep up with Mahiru.<p></p>
        "You'll tire yourself out doing that. Shall I pamper you once for good luck?"<p></p>
        "Look here—"<p></p>
        "Well, should you ever request it, I'll pamper you any time, so—" Mahiru patted her<p></p>
        chest reassuringly and smiled.<p></p>
        The memory of burying his face in the soft flesh there the other day made Amane press<p></p>
        his lips together.<p></p>
        Mahiru had only embraced him in an attempt to console him when he seemed down,<p></p>
        but it was the sort of gesture that had particular significance to a boy of his age. At the<p></p>
        time, he had been so caught up in his emotions that he had been more preoccupied<p></p>
        with the kindness she had shown him than the physical sensations of the embrace.<p></p>
        Next time, Amane knew he would take in and savor the feeling of her body. Precisely<p></p>
        because he was aware of how shameless that would be, he wanted to refrain.<p></p>
        "…It's frightening how you seem willing to do anything I ask," he muttered.<p></p>
        "I mean, if it's something I'm able to do, I'll do what I can. Of course, I expect to be<p></p>
        repaid, though."<p></p>
        "I think I would feel even worse if you did all sorts of things for me without any<p></p>
        expectation of repayment."<p></p>
        "But when it comes to acts of selfless love and altruism, in most cases, a sense of<p></p>
        emotional satisfaction is pretty much the only compensation, right?"<p></p>
        "Incidentally, how do you want me to thank you?"<p></p>
        "…I'd like you to listen to a request of mine."<p></p>
        This was Mahiru, so Amane wasn't expecting her to ask for money or anything, but he<p></p>
        snickered unintentionally at the sweet way she asked for such vague restitution.<p></p>
        "Sure, as long as it's something I'm able to do. Any kind of fair exchange."<p></p>
        "My request is pretty selfish."<p></p>
        "Somehow I doubt that."<p></p>
        "It really is… You can only say that because you don't know the true extent of my<p></p>
        selfishness."<p></p>
        "All right, let's hear it, then. What's your request?" Amane figured that if she was<p></p>
        making such a big deal about it, it must be something major. He was curious to know<p></p>
        what a big request from Mahiru might be.<p></p>
        Mahiru's face stiffened slightly.<p></p>
        When Amane stared directly into her pretty caramel-coloured eyes, wondering what on<p></p>
        earth she was about to say, she started to let her gaze wander.<p></p>
        Amane couldn't make out whether Mahiru's wish was truly something so significant<p></p>
        that she was hesitant to say it out loud, or if she was just putting on an act.<p></p>
        He stared intently at her as her cheeks gradually reddened.<p></p>
        "Well…"<p></p>
        "Yes?"<p></p>
        "Umm, it's…"<p></p>
        "It's…?"<p></p>
        "…A-Amane, I want you to pat my head, too." 1<p></p>
        Without meaning to, Amane smiled stiffly at Mahiru, who had started to say something<p></p>
        else, and helplessly made that desperate plea in her panic to avoid voicing her original<p></p>
        request.<p></p>
        "Is that what you're going with? There was something else you were about to say,<p></p>
        wasn't there?"<p></p>
        "It's fine."<p></p>
        He was curious to know what she had been about to say, but thought it would put her<p></p>
        in a bad mood if he pressed anymore, so he left it there and extended a hand.<p></p>
        He did pat her head occasionally, but it was rare for Mahiru herself to ask for it. He<p></p>
        would do this sort of thing anytime she asked without expecting anything in return,<p></p>
        and in fact, he very much enjoyed it, so long as Mahiru didn't hate it. But he did find it<p></p>
        adorable that she had humbly asked for it out loud.<p></p>
        The tension visibly left Mahiru's face as Amane stroked her head just as she had<p></p>
        requested.<p></p>
        "I don't know what part of this is supposed to be selfish, though."<p></p>
        "It is selfish. Because I want you to touch me more."<p></p>
        "Touch you?"<p></p>
        Amane's movements stiffened. Before he noticed her moving, Mahiru was looking up<p></p>
        at him with her usual soft face and glistening eyes.<p></p>
        "I like it when you touch me, Amane. I don't usually enjoy making physical contact with 2<p></p>
        people, but I think your hands feel nice."<p></p>
        "Is that… so?"<p></p>
        Mahiru seemed oblivious to the implications of what she'd just said. She was wearing<p></p>
        her usual gentle expression as she nudged closer to him, pleadingly.<p></p>
        As the distance between them narrowed, Amane could smell her sweet scent more<p></p>
        clearly, and his heartbeat inevitably quickened.<p></p>
        …I think this girl might be trying to kill me.<p></p>
        Any normal guy would count himself lucky to hear the girl he liked say that she wanted<p></p>
        him to touch her; he'd probably go ahead and do it, knowing what he was getting into.<p></p>
        Amane was a healthy young man, and the invitation was very tempting, but he also<p></p>
        knew that Mahiru was so affectionate with him because of how deeply she trusted<p></p>
        him.<p></p>
        "You don't touch me often, Amane, but when you do, you do it in a way that's gentle<p></p>
        and thoughtful, don't you? It's really calming, and it feels nice. I think you emit a<p></p>
        soothing aura or something."<p></p>
        Mahiru was probably teasing Amane, at least a little.<p></p>
        "…It's not all that relaxing for me, you know. You're a girl, Mahiru, so it's not like I can<p></p>
        touch you thoughtlessly."<p></p>
        "I don't mind."<p></p>
        "I do. Let me try telling you to touch me; I bet you'll feel uncomfortable."<p></p>
        He cautioned against it a little too strongly—deep down, he was still feeling insecure<p></p>
        about the fact that she didn't seem to think of him as a real man.<p></p>
        In response, he got a placid smile and the question, "…Will you touch me?"<p></p>
        It felt like she was carelessly trying to provoke him. Against his better judgment, he<p></p>
        pinched Mahiru's squishy cheeks. In a sense, he did touch her as asked, but the<p></p>
        dissatisfaction on Mahiru's face was evident.<p></p>
        "Come on, I won't mention it outside this apartment, and I won't ask the same of<p></p>
        anyone but you, Amane…" 1<p></p>
        "Absolutely not, don't be ridiculous."<p></p>
        Amane didn't mean it that way, but his answer came out almost in a growl, filled with<p></p>
        emotion. He was flustered, hearing words that she would only say to him.<p></p>
        Amane was frantically trying to get ahold of himself and all the unspeakable thoughts<p></p>
        that were filling his mind. He cupped Mahiru's hands in his. That was as much<p></p>
        touching as he could allow himself.<p></p>
        Mahiru blinked, fluttering her long eyelashes, and gave Amane a gentle smile that<p></p>
        looked just a little embarrassed. He could clearly see relief and happiness in her<p></p>
        expression, which made him feel embarrassed, too.<p></p>
        "…You feel warm. Speaking of, sometimes you get really warm."<p></p>
        "…I'll let go this instant."<p></p>
        "No, don't. As I expected, your hands are warm, and big, and rugged… very different<p></p>
        from mine."<p></p>
        "You're small, and dainty, and delicate, so I feel anxious touching you."<p></p>
        "I won't break that easily. Besides, when you touch me, you're always gentle. I can tell<p></p>
        right away that you would absolutely never hurt me."<p></p>
        "…I'd never be rough with any girl."<p></p>
        Amane was absolutely sure that he would never knowingly hurt the girl he wanted to<p></p>
        cherish forever. To him, she was someone very delicate who he wanted to protect from<p></p>
        harm.<p></p>
        Even though he knew she wasn't fragile, he carefully stroked the back of Mahiru's hand<p></p>
        as if he was touching a fragile piece of porcelain, and she narrowed her
        <p></p>
        caramel-coloured eyes as if it tickled.<p></p>
        "…That's exactly why I trust you and why I'm asking you to touch me." Mahiru smiled.<p></p>
        She was overwhelmingly lovely, and, suppressing the urge to embrace her right then<p></p>
        and there and make her his, Amane mirrored her smile.<p></p>
        Chapter 42: The Angel in the Dream, Feelings of Shame<p></p>
        "…I love you."<p></p>
        A voice full of anticipation spoke these few, simple words.<p></p>
        Her voice was quiet as it left her soft, pink lips, and she approached him seductively.<p></p>
        Amane was propping himself up on the bed, and she lowered her hips onto his legs, 1<p></p>
        pinning him in place.<p></p>
        Strangely, he didn't feel any weight at all.<p></p>
        But the soft touch of her skin and her fragrant smell filled his senses.<p></p>
        Mahiru leaned coquettishly up against him and wrapped her arms around his back,<p></p>
        closing the gap between them as she cast her eyes down shyly. Amane looked down<p></p>
        and saw a fresh expanse of skin that normally never saw the light of day, peeking from<p></p>
        the neckline of her white dress.<p></p>
        He tried to avert his gaze from the deep valley between her breasts, but Mahiru moved<p></p>
        her hands from his back up to his neck and pulled his face closer, as if to tell him not<p></p>
        to look away.<p></p>
        A sigh escaped her lips.<p></p>
        "…Touch me more?" she whispered.<p></p>
        Amane wrapped his arms around her delicate back and slowly brought his lips<p></p>
        closer—<p></p>
        "—Ah?"<p></p>
        He sat up straight.<p></p>
        Amane was alone in his bedroom. The morning sun shone into the room through a gap<p></p>
        in the closed curtains.<p></p>
        When he looked at the clock on his side table, he saw that it was just past five.<p></p>
        With the approach of summer, the sun was rising earlier—it was early enough to get<p></p>
        a start on the day, although Amane certainly hadn't intended to wake up at this hour.<p></p>
        He pressed the palm of his hand against his face as he remembered what he'd been<p></p>
        dreaming about and was immediately overcome with shame.<p></p>
        This is the worst…<p></p>
        The dream had taken him by surprise.<p></p>
        Previously, when Mahiru had appeared in his dreams, she had behaved as usual—<p></p>
        never acting with such blatant desire. When she'd told him the day before that she<p></p>
        wanted him to touch her more, that must have provided the inspiration for his fantasy,<p></p>
        but even so, he felt ashamed. His mind had imagined Mahiru acting in ways she never<p></p>
        would. Even though it had only been a dream, he still felt guilty about having those<p></p>
        kinds of feelings toward her.<p></p>
        It was very frustrating—he wanted to cherish Mahiru and treat her respectfully, but<p></p>
        his subconscious mind apparently had other ideas. He had the fleeting temptation to<p></p>
        slam his head into the wall.<p></p>
        Amane decided that some exercise would be just the thing to clear his head. Pushing<p></p>
        away his subconscious desires, he made to leave his room, but paused on the way out.<p></p>
        "…Kill me now."<p></p>
        Before he could start the day, he was going to need a nice long shower to wash away<p></p>
        any lingering frustrations.<p></p>
        "Hey, Amane, what's with the dead expression?"<p></p>
        After getting up, Amane had gone for an early morning run to shake off his shame,<p></p>
        exhausting himself both physically and mentally. Chitose must have noticed, and<p></p>
        approached him during a break at school.<p></p>
        Amane looked at Itsuki, who was sitting beside him, to ask whether he looked that<p></p>
        lifeless, and Itsuki nodded.<p></p>
        "Ah, well… I went for a little run this morning," Amane explained.<p></p>
        "That'll wipe you out, no doubt." Chitose nodded. "A couch potato is sure to get groggy<p></p>
        when they finally start working out." Chitose cackled and grinned lightheartedly as<p></p>
        she slapped him on the back.<p></p>
        Amane was relieved that she didn't press him any further.<p></p>
        Telling Chitose something meant that Mahiru would know eventually anyway, so<p></p>
        Amane did his best to avoid telling her anything important. Honestly, he didn't want<p></p>
        to let anyone know about his dream.<p></p>
        "If you're not feeling well, you ought to go right home after school's over and rest. It's<p></p>
        best not to overdo it," Mahiru added, standing beside Chitose like her chaperone.<p></p>
        They were at school, so Mahiru was in her "angel mode," but her concern was genuine.<p></p>
        Amane had a feeling she was going to spoil him when they got home.<p></p>
        However, Amane knew that he wouldn't be able to accept her kindness—his lingering<p></p>
        guilt over the dream wouldn't even allow him to look Mahiru in the eye.<p></p>
        Without meeting her gaze, Amane responded flatly, "Thank you for your concern. I'm<p></p>
        fine, so there's no need to worry." He did his best not to allow any emotion to creep<p></p>
        into his words. From the corner of his eye, he could see Mahiru's expression stiffen<p></p>
        slightly.<p></p>
        Amane was trying not to let the awkwardness he felt every time he looked at Mahiru<p></p>
        show on his face, but from her perspective, it probably seemed like he had suddenly<p></p>
        gotten angry at her.<p></p>
        He couldn't possibly explain the reason for his icy demeanor, so there was nothing to<p></p>
        do but keep his mouth shut and evade the issue.<p></p>
        Everyone knew that Amane was a gloomy introvert, downright unsociable really, so<p></p>
        nothing about this behavior should have aroused anyone's suspicions.<p></p>
        "…Are you feeling unwell, Amane?" Mahiru asked. 2<p></p>
        "No, I'm not sick, I'm just tired," he replied. "Really, I'm trying my best to not fall asleep.<p></p>
        We've got tests coming up, so I can't very well sleep through class now."<p></p>
        "Geez! So serious." Chitose giggled.<p></p>
        "You should try to be more serious, too," he chided. "Our school's exams are hard, so<p></p>
        stop playing around and try studying for a change."<p></p>
        "Speaking of exams, I think it would be more fun, and more effective, if we did our<p></p>
        studying all together, don't you?" Chitose asked.<p></p>
        "Oh? Then perhaps Shiina ought to tutor you."<p></p>
        "I guess that would work, but…"<p></p>
        Chitose was staring hard at Amane, but he refused to make eye contact with her. He<p></p>
        pulled the materials for the next class out of his desk and directed his attention toward<p></p>
        arranging them.<p></p>
        If he participated any longer in the conversation, he would inevitably have to talk to<p></p>
        Mahiru. He sighed softly and leafed through a textbook as if the rest of the discussion<p></p>
        was no concern of his.<p></p>
        Amane left school promptly after classes ended, did the evening's shopping, and<p></p>
        returned home.<p></p>
        As usual, Mahiru was already in his apartment, preparing food, but she was obviously<p></p>
        feeling dejected.<p></p>
        She seemed to be able to sense that something was different about his mood and kept<p></p>
        glancing over at him and frowning. Often at home, they would act a little more familiar,<p></p>
        but that evening, she carefully maintained a sense of distance that was not all that<p></p>
        different from how she behaved at school.<p></p>
        Amane still felt terribly awkward, and he tried to push thoughts of Mahiru out of his<p></p>
        mind as best he could. It was easy to understand how she might interpret that as him<p></p>
        ignoring her.<p></p>
        "Are you mad at me…?" Mahiru asked nervously, after they had finished eating dinner<p></p>
        without even looking at each other once.<p></p>
        Realizing his error, Amane looked up at her.<p></p>
        Mahiru's eyes flickered with anxiety.<p></p>
        "I'm not mad," he replied.<p></p>
        "People only answer that way when they're mad. You've been acting strange all day,<p></p>
        and you're being terse with me… Did I do something to upset you without realizing<p></p>
        it…?"<p></p>
        Even though Amane had clearly been the one avoiding her, Mahiru sounded apologetic,<p></p>
        which made him realize that he had only been thinking about his own personal<p></p>
        discomfort.<p></p>
        Flustered, Amane took Mahiru's hands in his and peered into her eyes, which were<p></p>
        more tearful than usual.<p></p>
        "N-no, that's not it. You didn't do anything, Mahiru. I'm sorry for hurting your feelings."<p></p>
        "So then, why… why are you acting so cold?"<p></p>
        "W-well, um, there are a number of reasons, I guess you could say…"<p></p>
        Amane found himself faltering when it came time to offer any.<p></p>
        He obviously knew he couldn't be too honest—a girl like Mahiru would definitely be<p></p>
        put off by something like that. He didn't want to put her in an awkward position or<p></p>
        make her uncomfortable around him later.<p></p>
        "I've been wondering if maybe you'd gotten tired of me or something…"<p></p>
        "Absolutely not!" Amane insisted. "I-I've just got some personal stuff going on…<p></p>
        There's just a lot on my mind."<p></p>
        "…And you're not going to tell me about it?"<p></p>
        Mahiru frowned dejectedly and looked at the floor. Amane could only groan.<p></p>
        How can I possibly explain?<p></p>
        He hated lying to her, so he decided the best course of action was to only tell her the<p></p>
        mildest version of the truth. Though he wasn't sure exactly how to round off the rough<p></p>
        edges or sound vague in this particular case.<p></p>
        If he messed up, she wouldn't understand, and she might even be repulsed instead.<p></p>
        "It—it's no big deal, really, okay?"<p></p>
        "…Even though it's something bad enough to make you ignore me?"<p></p>
        "No, the thing is, I mean, how do I put this? I'm doing it to exercise self-control, or, like,<p></p>
        to settle my mind down."<p></p>
        "You don't feel calm when I'm around?"<p></p>
        "That's not what I mean, it's just, it's d-difficult."<p></p>
        "So it's hard to spend time with me?"<p></p>
        "That's not what I said! Geez, how can I say this…?"<p></p>
        If she was a boy, it would have been easy. Amane wasn't sure he could put it in a way 2<p></p>
        that a girl would understand, no matter what he said to her. Yet he had to tell her<p></p>
        something, or she would misunderstand again.<p></p>
        Mahiru obviously wanted to know why he was avoiding her if she hadn't done<p></p>
        anything wrong, but all Amane could manage to tell her was that it was hard to explain.<p></p>
        For the sake of his likely nonexistent pride, he needed to put it as delicately as possible.<p></p>
        "…So you said that you want me to touch you more," he explained tentatively. "And<p></p>
        because of that, how do I say this, I… had a, uh, a dream."<p></p>
        "A… dream?"<p></p>
        "…A dream where you were pleading with me, very sweetly, for certain things…"<p></p>
        Somehow, that was the best answer Amane could come up with.<p></p>
        Mahiru made a face like she didn't understand what he was talking about. She blinked<p></p>
        her wide eyes dramatically.<p></p>
        "R-really, I hate that I dreamed something like that," Amane continued. "I try to avoid<p></p>
        seeing you that way, and I would never be pushy about touching you. But this time I<p></p>
        just… it's because yesterday, you… you were saying such cute things. And then, about<p></p>
        me avoiding you awkwardly… it wasn't because I was mad at you or anything, it was<p></p>
        because I was disgusted with myself…"<p></p>
        "…How exactly was I pleading with you, Amane?"<p></p>
        "Are you trying to embarrass me?!" he balked. Mahiru hadn't recoiled from him, which<p></p>
        was good, but her curiosity seemed somehow even more dangerous, and he could feel<p></p>
        his face twitching.<p></p>
        Dreams supposedly reflected desires, so if he told her what he had dreamed, she<p></p>
        would then know he thought of her and looked at her in that way, even if it was not on<p></p>
        purpose.<p></p>
        "Embarrass you…? No, I was just thinking I must have been really aggressive, if it was<p></p>
        enough to make you feel uncomfortable. So I wanted to know, for reference."<p></p>
        "You don't need to know. What sort of reference would that be useful for anyway?"<p></p>
        "…Like for when I'm trying to make your heart race."<p></p>
        "Would you please stop trying to give me a heart attack?"<p></p>
        Amane didn't understand why Mahiru seemed to enjoy tormenting him. She had<p></p>
        already found plenty of questionable ways to surprise him, so he didn't want to give<p></p>
        her any more ideas.<p></p>
        Mahiru looked relieved, like she'd completely forgotten about any concern or anxiety<p></p>
        that had been previously troubling her. Her cheeks had reddened faintly, probably<p></p>
        because Amane had let the word "cute" slip out of his mouth.<p></p>
        "It's a relief to hear that I'm not being shunned—I'm glad we cleared that up."<p></p>
        For some reason, Mahiru's mouth curled upward in a good-humored smile. She stared<p></p>
        contently at Amane, who had his own lips tightly drawn in shame and embarrassment.<p></p>
        "Amane, you're kind of… well, among the boys I know, you're the most innocent."<p></p>
        "Oh, be quiet, I could say the same about you."<p></p>
        "I'm sure you would have been more surprised if you'd learned that I was used to being<p></p>
        in the company of males quite often… Really, though, I've never spent much time<p></p>
        around boys before. You're the only one I'm this close with, Amane."<p></p>
        "…A-and I hardly ever associate with girls, so…"<p></p>
