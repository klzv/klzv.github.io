        <p></p>with his culinary talents.
        <p></p>"Our son's not giving you any trouble, is he?"
        <p></p>A few moments after they had finished eating, Shuuto
        <p></p>began to talk to Mahiru.
        <p></p>Shihoko took care of cleanup, and they could hear her
        <p></p>washing dishes in the kitchen.
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked at the question and immediately shook
        <p></p>her head.
        <p></p>"Trouble…? No, nothing like that."
        <p></p>"You can be honest, if you feel like you're being forced to
        <p></p>take care of him."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…I've never disliked spending time with Amane or
        <p></p>considered it a burden. I always have a good time with him."
        <p></p>"Good to know."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't think of anything to say. His reply came
        <p></p>out more clipped than he intended.
        <p></p>"Don't be shy, Amane; you ought to thank her for what
        <p></p>she does."
        <p></p>"…I'm always grateful."
        <p></p>"Yes, I know."
        <p></p>Mahiru had picked up on him trying to hide his
        <p></p>embarrassment, and she laughed in her clear and beautiful
        <p></p>voice. That made him feel even more mortified, and in his
        <p></p>vexation, he repeatedly pressed and unpressed his lips,
        <p></p>which only made her giggle even more. It was hopeless.
        <p></p>He looked at Mahiru, ready to warn her that she would be
        <p></p>sorry for this, but all he could see was her charming smile,
        <p></p>and it was obvious that his words wouldn't do much good.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't stand it any longer and turned away. Even
        <p></p>his father began laughing at him.
        <p></p>"You just can't be honest, can you? Really. That is one of
        <p></p>the cute things about you, though, Amane."
        <p></p>"Why would you call a guy cute? Are you making fun of
        <p></p>me?"
        <p></p>"He's right; you are cute."
        <p></p>"Mahiru, we're going to have to talk about that later."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Okay. Let's talk later."
        <p></p>She answered cheerfully, and Amane was at a loss for
        <p></p>words. Mahiru was being more assertive than usual. He had
        <p></p>been worried that she might be feeling nervous, but she
        <p></p>seemed to have loosened up.
        <p></p>Simply by sharing this kind of exchange with Amane, she
        <p></p>was showing how familiar they were.
        <p></p>Amane's father watched their exchange with interest.
        <p></p>Suddenly, he blinked dramatically, as if he had just
        <p></p>remembered something important.
        <p></p>"Oh, right, Shiina, if you don't mind, would you go
        <p></p>shopping with me? Shihoko asked me to pick up a few
        <p></p>things."
        <p></p>"Why are you trying to take her with you?" Amane
        <p></p>objected emphatically.
        <p></p>His father continued smiling calmly. "Relax, it's not like
        <p></p>I'm going to drag her all over town chatting and giggling like
        <p></p>your mother, you know?"
        <p></p>"I know that, but—"
        <p></p>"Anyway, you can stay home and watch the house."
        <p></p>"What, why?!"
        <p></p>"Well, because I'm going to tell her about old times, and
        <p></p>it'll be a nuisance if the centerpiece of the story is there."
        <p></p>"Did you just call me a nuisance?!" Amane demanded.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"I did," his father smoothly confirmed.
        <p></p>Amane was again at a loss for words.
        <p></p>His father looked at Mahiru. "So you don't mind going on
        <p></p>an errand with an old man?"
        <p></p>"No, not at all. It would be my pleasure," Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"Great, I'll be glad to have you accompany me." He smiled
        <p></p>broadly. "While we're out, I want you to help me pick out a
        <p></p>present for Shihoko."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked bewildered. "P-present? Is today an
        <p></p>anniversary or something…?"
        <p></p>"Dad often buys Mom gifts, even on days that aren't
        <p></p>anything special."
        <p></p>Amane's father was a ladies' man who was extremely kind
        <p></p>to women—and especially to his beloved wife. He frequently
        <p></p>gave her gifts, even when there wasn't any kind of occasion.
        <p></p>He said that he did it out of gratitude for the things she
        <p></p>did every day, as proof of his love, and because he wanted to
        <p></p>see her happy face. Amane had also accompanied his father
        <p></p>on such shopping trips when he visited home.
        <p></p>His father had probably invited Mahiru so he could get
        <p></p>suggestions from a female perspective. But his main goal
        <p></p>was definitely to tell stories about Amane.
        <p></p>"…You're a lot like your father, Amane."
        <p></p>"I don't do as much as he does, though."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"You found me stuffed animals and cute little things and
        <p></p>bought them for me, didn't you?"
        <p></p>It was true he had bought gifts that he thought would
        <p></p>make Mahiru happy or look good on her, but he gave her
        <p></p>those things because of how he felt about her and as thanks
        <p></p>for looking after him on a daily basis.
        <p></p>Maybe that did mean he was like his father, but he didn't
        <p></p>think his efforts were as frequent.
        <p></p>"Well, I mean, you do help me out every day, so…"
        <p></p>"…Yeah, and that's my point?"
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed exasperated with Amane, who answered
        <p></p>by making excuses, and yet she laughed with a joyful,
        <p></p>humorous tone.
        <p></p>Amane's father also looked over at him with apparent
        <p></p>amusement, so Amane stumbled to his feet and made for the
        <p></p>kitchen where his mother was cleaning up the dishes,
        <p></p>running away under the pretense of going to help her.
        <p></p>"Oh, Amane? Wouldn't you rather be talking with
        <p></p>Mahiru?" Shihoko asked.
        <p></p>"Mahiru's planning to head out with Dad soon to do some
        <p></p>shopping."
        <p></p>Amane glanced back into the living room, where the two
        <p></p>of them were smiling and getting ready to leave.
        <p></p>They were moving quickly. Amane's father obviously
        <p></p>wanted to give Amane some space to cool off after he started
        <p></p>sulking. He was sometimes intimidated by his father's ability
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>to see right through to the inner workings of other people's
        <p></p>minds.
        <p></p>"Ah, they're going shopping, are they? And I think your
        <p></p>father has some things he wants to ask Mahiru, so this is
        <p></p>probably a good time."
        <p></p>"What is he planning to ask her…?"
        <p></p>"Just normal stuff, probably? It's not like I always know
        <p></p>what Shuuto's thinking."
        <p></p>Amane's mother handed him the paella pan after she had
        <p></p>washed it and put it on the burner to dry, so he obediently
        <p></p>returned it to the shelf where the cookware was stored.
        <p></p>While he was doing that, Mahiru and his father departed.
        <p></p>Amane gave a somewhat forlorn glance across the living
        <p></p>room, in the direction of the door they'd left through, and
        <p></p>then went back to help his mother finish washing up, drying
        <p></p>the clean dishes and putting them back on that same shelf.
        <p></p>It was work that he frequently helped Mahiru with, and
        <p></p>Amane was proud of how skillfully he handled the task. His
        <p></p>mother's eyes widened when she saw him.
        <p></p>"You've really mastered those movements, Amane."
        <p></p>"Thanks for noticing."
        <p></p>"I'm relieved to see that you're not just making Mahiru do
        <p></p>everything."
        <p></p>"What kind of worthless, awful guy did you think I
        <p></p>was…?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Of course, he wasn't the kind of shameless person who
        <p></p>would make Mahiru do all the work.
        <p></p>He would feel guilty, first and foremost, if he left
        <p></p>everything to her.
        <p></p>She handled the hard work of cooking for him, so Amane
        <p></p>figured he should help where he could and be sensitive to
        <p></p>her needs.
        <p></p>He looked pointedly at his mother, as if to say it was only
        <p></p>reasonable that he would help.
        <p></p>Still looking impressed, she addressed him again, "…Say,
        <p></p>Amane?"
        <p></p>"What is it?"
        <p></p>"How far have you gone with Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Pff?!" Amane sputtered. He had certainly not been
        <p></p>expecting that question.
        <p></p>His mother calmly finished washing a plate.
        <p></p>Without thinking, he took the clean plate and wiped the
        <p></p>water off it with a towel, but he couldn't hide his agitation
        <p></p>and furrowed his brow.
        <p></p>"Why are you so nervous? You're obviously dating; I can
        <p></p>feel it in the air. That's just like you—you can't hide
        <p></p>anything."
        <p></p>Once she said that, he couldn't deny it.
        <p></p>The atmosphere between Amane and Mahiru had
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>changed since their shrine visit at the start of the year. That
        <p></p>was only natural, since they'd begun dating, but he had
        <p></p>thought he was hiding it quite well from his parents.
        <p></p>Since his mother had seen right through him in the end,
        <p></p>that effort had been meaningless.
        <p></p>"…Is that a bad thing?"
        <p></p>"No? Actually I was hoping that she would one day visit as
        <p></p>our new daughter-in-law, so she's very welcome."
        <p></p>"…Really?"
        <p></p>"The way you were looking at each other, the air between
        <p></p>you two was so charged, I thought for sure you had already
        <p></p>gone all the way, though."
        <p></p>"Bah! No way!" Amane's eyebrows shot up at her
        <p></p>outrageous suspicion. "…Mom, you can't say stuff like that in
        <p></p>front of Mahiru."
        <p></p>But his mother didn't seem ashamed. "Of course I'm not
        <p></p>going to say that to sweet Mahiru. But personally, I do want
        <p></p>a daughter. I'm counting on you!"
        <p></p>Amane didn't blame her, since he understood her feelings
        <p></p>as a mother who wanted a daughter but hadn't been blessed
        <p></p>with one, so he just pursed his lips.
        <p></p>"…Just don't put any pressure on her."
        <p></p>"I know that. That's why I've got to get you to keep her
        <p></p>around."
        <p></p>"Do you really think I would let go of something I truly
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>want?"
        <p></p>In the past, he had thought that so long as Mahiru was
        <p></p>happy, he didn't care if he wasn't her partner and had been
        <p></p>prepared to let her go, but now he couldn't say that.
        <p></p>Maybe he had become petty, which was probably true, but
        <p></p>he could also say that his desire to cherish Mahiru and never
        <p></p>give her up had only grown stronger. He wanted to make her
        <p></p>happy—and make her fall for him so hard that she wouldn't
        <p></p>think about anyone else. He wanted to treasure her and keep
        <p></p>her to himself.
        <p></p>He wasn't going to let Mahiru slip between his fingers.
        <p></p>Shihoko was momentarily taken aback by Amane's
        <p></p>confident assertion, and then she chuckled cheerfully. "Haha, you're like your father in that regard,
        too, you know. He
        <p></p>loves me just as much today as he did long ago."
        <p></p>"I didn't inherit Dad's natural skill with the ladies,
        <p></p>though."
        <p></p>"I wonder? Shall we ask Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Hey, don't you dare."
        <p></p>If his mother asked something embarrassing like that,
        <p></p>Mahiru would probably have a fit, so Amane had to do
        <p></p>whatever it took to prevent that.
        <p></p>He glared at his mother to tell her to stop, but it didn't
        <p></p>seem to have any effect on her. Cheerfully, she said, "I can't
        <p></p>wait until Mahiru gets back," and Amane frowned again.
        <p></p>After several hours, Amane's father and Mahiru returned
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>when it was around time his mother said they should be
        <p></p>getting started on dinner preparations.
        <p></p>Amane had fled his mother's relentless teasing and
        <p></p>headed up to his room to unpack his bags and kill some time
        <p></p>with his school books. Mahiru came to see him right after
        <p></p>she returned.
        <p></p>Amane had taken most of his furniture with him to his
        <p></p>apartment, so there wasn't much to look at in his room, and
        <p></p>his mother cleaned it periodically, so he wasn't embarrassed
        <p></p>to show it to her. He invited her in casually, but she seemed
        <p></p>a little restless.
        <p></p>He couldn't tell whether that was because they were alone
        <p></p>together, or because they were in his room, or maybe
        <p></p>because of her outing with his father. But at any rate,
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem as if she would calm down soon, so he
        <p></p>put a cushion on the floor and motioned for her to sit down.
        <p></p>"Welcome back, Mahiru. Are you tired?" Amane asked as
        <p></p>he brought over barley tea for two and placed the cups on a
        <p></p>small folding table. After blinking several times, Mahiru
        <p></p>smiled.
        <p></p>"No, we were sitting the whole time we were traveling on
        <p></p>the way here, so moving my body was just what I needed."
        <p></p>"I see… So the reason you're fidgeting so much is because
        <p></p>of something you heard from my dad?"
        <p></p>Apparently he had hit the bull's-eye. Mahiru averted her
        <p></p>eyes nervously, and Amane sighed.
        <p></p>He wasn't upset with Mahiru, but there were several
        <p></p>things he would have liked to say to his father. However,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>there was no way to tell whether Shuuto would be vague and
        <p></p>evasive, or turn around and make fun of him, so he wasn't
        <p></p>going to say anything.
        <p></p>"Geez, my dad… What did he tell you?"
        <p></p>"It wasn't that big of a deal. He just asked how you were
        <p></p>doing and told me you were cute when you were a kid, stuff
        <p></p>like that."
        <p></p>"…What did you hear?"
        <p></p>As would be expected, Amane had only a vague
        <p></p>recollection of things he did in childhood, and he wasn't
        <p></p>even sure if there were things he would be embarrassed
        <p></p>about.
        <p></p>Nevertheless, if his father had gone out of his way to tell
        <p></p>Mahiru stories, that must have meant he had done
        <p></p>something memorable. He had probably told her stuff that,
        <p></p>from a parent's perspective, made for cute and funny
        <p></p>anecdotes, but from Amane's standpoint, stories of failure
        <p></p>from his childhood were embarrassing and no laughing
        <p></p>matter.
        <p></p>He narrowed his eyes and looked to Mahiru for details,
        <p></p>but she blatantly turned away.
        <p></p>"Th-that's, um… Well…"
        <p></p>"Why are you looking away?"
        <p></p>"The only thing I learned is that you're definitely cute."
        <p></p>Mahiru gave a reply that didn't answer anything, and
        <p></p>Amane let out a dramatic sigh.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Wh-what is it?"
        <p></p>"This is what happens to bad girls who won't answer
        <p></p>seriously."
        <p></p>Mahiru had been sitting off to the side, and he pulled her
        <p></p>toward him and made her sit between his legs. He embraced
        <p></p>her from behind, wrapping himself around her, and touched
        <p></p>Mahiru's belly.
        <p></p>She seemed surprised by this and twisted her body
        <p></p>around to look up at Amane.
        <p></p>"Ah, um, Amane?"
        <p></p>"You're pretty ticklish, right, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"…W-wait, please! Let's talk about this!"
        <p></p>"If you had fessed up in the first place, it wouldn't have
        <p></p>come to this."
        <p></p>He slowly moved his hands over her sides, following her
        <p></p>body over her clothes, and he clearly felt her squirm.
        <p></p>Feeling her slim figure, he ran his fingers slowly over the
        <p></p>smooth line of her waist and heard a small gasp.
        <p></p>Her reaction was so enticing that, against his better
        <p></p>judgment, he wiggled his fingers, gently grazing her skin and
        <p></p>tickling her again.
        <p></p>Seeing Mahiru squirm in his arms filled him with all sorts
        <p></p>of problematic feelings, but it was too late to stop.
        <p></p>"Ha, hey, wait…hee-hee, Amane…"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Wow, you really are ticklish, Mahiru."
        <p></p>He only touched her very gently, but Mahiru was
        <p></p>apparently very sensitive. She was clutching her knees to her
        <p></p>chest, trembling, and letting out little gasps of air.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure whether to think it was cute or be
        <p></p>shocked by how stubborn she was.
        <p></p>As he was tickling her softly, he made sure not to touch
        <p></p>any risky places. Perhaps unable to stand it any longer,
        <p></p>Mahiru suddenly turned her whole body around to face
        <p></p>Amane.
        <p></p>She glared at him with slightly flushed cheeks and eyes
        <p></p>teary from the tickling, and Amane's heart pounded for
        <p></p>several reasons.
        <p></p>"A-Amane, you dummy. That was mean."
        <p></p>"If you had told me everything right away, this never
        <p></p>would have happened."
        <p></p>"W-we really didn't talk about anything important. He
        <p></p>told me about when you had a head-on collision with a
        <p></p>utility pole when you were little and cried a lot, and how you
        <p></p>used to cling to your mom on Mother's Day and tell her you
        <p></p>loved her in baby talk, and how you once put wax in your
        <p></p>hair because you wanted to look cool like your dad and
        <p></p>ended up with hard, spiky hair. That kind of stuff, that's all."
        <p></p>"Those are the worst kind of stories!"
        <p></p>When he learned that Mahiru had heard about such
        <p></p>embarrassing incidents that he didn't even remember,
        <p></p>Amane covered his face with his hands.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>He had figured that his parents would tell her stories from
        <p></p>his childhood, but he would have liked to know why they'd
        <p></p>decided to only share the embarrassing ones.
        <p></p>From his parents' perspective, those were probably just
        <p></p>charming anecdotes, but to Amane, they were part of a dark
        <p></p>past.
        <p></p>"I—I thought they were cute?"
        <p></p>"Don't compliment me. Forget those stories."
        <p></p>"…I refuse, since you tickled me."
        <p></p>Amane knew that the stories would probably have been
        <p></p>burned into her memories even if he hadn't done that, but
        <p></p>when he heard the slightly peevish tone behind her words,
        <p></p>he regretted that he might have pushed things too far and
        <p></p>wrapped his arms gently around Mahiru from behind.
        <p></p>"Okay, okay, I'm sorry."
        <p></p>"…Next time you tickle me, I'm going to whisper all the
        <p></p>stories I heard right into your ear, Amane."
        <p></p>"Hold off on the psychological warfare… I get it, I get it.
        <p></p>Sorry."
        <p></p>He hugged her and stroked her hair to calm her down,
        <p></p>and Mahiru settled docilely into Amane's arms and buried
        <p></p>her face in his collar.
        <p></p>"Mahiru dear, go and have your bath."
        <p></p>They were sitting around after dinner, and it was getting
        <p></p>about time for everyone to take a bath, when Shihoko turned
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>to Mahiru, who was sitting beside Amane watching the
        <p></p>television.
        <p></p>"I can go after…"
        <p></p>"You're our guest, so don't hold back, okay? If you don't
        <p></p>want to get in alone, we'll lend you Amane for a bit."
        <p></p>"What a stupid thing to say, Mom." Amane's eyebrow
        <p></p>furrowed when his mother made an outrageous suggestion
        <p></p>with a broad grin.
        <p></p>When she said she would lend her son, she was suggesting
        <p></p>Amane should get in the bathtub with Mahiru, something
        <p></p>that Mahiru almost certainly would not consent to. Even
        <p></p>though they had splashed around in their swimsuits the
        <p></p>other day, getting fully nude together was still unthinkable.
        <p></p>Sure enough, Mahiru's face went bright red.
        <p></p>She glanced over at Amane, then flushed an even deeper
        <p></p>shade. She had definitely imagined seeing his body and
        <p></p>gotten even more embarrassed.
        <p></p>Amane knew he would also be writhing in shame if he
        <p></p>imagined anything in detail, so he did everything in his
        <p></p>power to not think too much.
        <p></p>"S-so we'd be, um, naked…"
        <p></p>"Oh, should I lay out an extra towel?"
        <p></p>"N-no, thank you…"
        <p></p>"Goodness, you don't need to be so embarrassed! Shuuto
        <p></p>and I bathe together all the time."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Th-that's…"
        <p></p>"Mahiru, don't take her too seriously. I mean, Mom and
        <p></p>Dad do get in the bath together a lot, but we don't have to do
        <p></p>that."
        <p></p>His mother had been joking around, but there was more
        <p></p>to it. Amane's parents were intimate with each other all the
        <p></p>time. If they went out walking together, they invariably held
        <p></p>hands and smiled at each other, and when it was time to
        <p></p>sleep, they both shared a bed. They were that consistent.
        <p></p>No matter how you looked at it, the two of them were
        <p></p>head over heels for each other, which was kind of
        <p></p>embarrassing for their son. But around town, they were
        <p></p>known as a couple of lovebirds. The two of them even took
        <p></p>their baths together. They believed that spending lots of time
        <p></p>with one another was important to maintaining a happy
        <p></p>marriage. Shihoko may have only been teasing, or she may
        <p></p>have honestly considered it their chance to get closer.
        <p></p>Either way, it's none of her business.
        <p></p>Amane was quite likely to dye the bathwater red with a
        <p></p>nosebleed if they got in together.
        <p></p>"You don't want to…? What's the matter with you young
        <p></p>people?"
        <p></p>"Whether we want to or not, do you think I could stand to
        <p></p>do that in my parents' home?"
        <p></p>"But I heard you were considering it at your apartment."
        <p></p>"…That's not up for discussion right now."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>He had realized what a convenient phrase that was the
        <p></p>other day at the pool when Mahiru had used it.
        <p></p>Amane could see that her eyes were darting around in
        <p></p>embarrassment, but in his heart, he couldn't say that he
        <p></p>didn't want to bathe together, so the best he could do was
        <p></p>dodge the question.
        <p></p>Honestly, he knew it would be incredibly awkward and
        <p></p>that the both of them would probably die of shame if they
        <p></p>tried. But at the same time, as a teenage boy, he couldn't
        <p></p>help but want to do it, just a little. He didn't think it would
        <p></p>happen, though.
        <p></p>Amane's father had been listening to the conversation
        <p></p>with amusement. He looked at Amane's stiff face and curled
        <p></p>his lips upward in somewhat of a wry smile.
        <p></p>"Shihoko dear, don't tease them too much."
        <p></p>"All right, fine," she relented.
        <p></p>Amane was immensely grateful for his father's
        <p></p>intervention.
        <p></p>"Go on, ignore my mom and go have your bath."
        <p></p>"O-okay. I'm going, then."
        <p></p>"You're such a cold fish, Amane. Have a good soak,
        <p></p>Mahiru dear."
        <p></p>Amane showed Mahiru to the bathroom to prevent
        <p></p>Shihoko from delaying her all night, then returned to the
        <p></p>living room.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>When Amane's father saw how exhausted he looked, he
        <p></p>chuckled and gave him a sympathetic smile.
        <p></p>Once Mahiru finished her bath, Amane's turn was next.
        <p></p>Knowing that his parents were going to get in together
        <p></p>and flirt happily in the tub, Amane had to take it before
        <p></p>them.
        <p></p>He felt his heart beat as he passed by Mahiru on his way
        <p></p>to the bathroom, and he quickly went to bathe.
        <p></p>He wasn't able to soak long because the thought that he
        <p></p>was sitting in the same water Mahiru had used kept popping
        <p></p>into his head, making him feel restless and dizzy.
        <p></p>Once Amane got out, his parents took their turn, so he
        <p></p>was left alone in the living room with Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Th-they're very intimate," Mahiru mumbled almost
        <p></p>unconsciously as she watched them go. Shuuto had his arm
        <p></p>around Shihoko's waist.
        <p></p>"They've been like that for as long as I can remember. I'm
        <p></p>used to it."
        <p></p>"…I think you have a great family."
        <p></p>"Thanks for saying so. Sometimes they give me heartburn,
        <p></p>though."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh."
        <p></p>Amane rubbed his chest and stuck out his tongue, and
        <p></p>Mahiru giggled quietly, covering her mouth.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Just asking, but are you going to be all right staying
        <p></p>here? You're not worn out or anything?"
        <p></p>"I'm fine. The two of them are being so nice to me… Like,
        <p></p>they're treating me as if I'm their real daughter…"
        <p></p>"Well, I guess it's because my parents always wanted one.
        <p></p>Now that such a cute, nice girl has shown up, they probably
        <p></p>want to dote on you."
        <p></p>"R-right."
        <p></p>Amane's parents had readily accepted Mahiru.
        <p></p>Of course, they were impressed with Mahiru's sweet
        <p></p>personality. Shihoko was practically smitten—and keen to
        <p></p>spend plenty of time with her.
        <p></p>Mahiru's cheeks were faintly red, maybe because she felt
        <p></p>bashful from being called cute.
        <p></p>"If you like, I don't mind letting my parents pamper you.
        <p></p>Ever since I left home, they have been starved for someone
        <p></p>to spoil. If there's anything you want, or any place you want
        <p></p>to go, just tell them, okay?"
        <p></p>His parents, especially his mother, seemed like they
        <p></p>would grant any wish Mahiru had with big smiles on their
        <p></p>faces.
        <p></p>"Y-you know I couldn't pester them like that… But—"
        <p></p>"But?"
        <p></p>"I—I would like it if we could all go out together… I've
        <p></p>always wanted to go on a big family outing…"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>At those final words, which she added in a truly fragile
        <p></p>voice that was barely louder than a whisper, Amane felt a
        <p></p>great pressure thumping in his chest.
        <p></p>He knew that Mahiru had a poor relationship with her
        <p></p>own family. Amane figured that, for Mahiru, being able to
        <p></p>develop a rapport with his parents allowed her to experience
        <p></p>something she never had with her family. He hoped she
        <p></p>would come to feel that way, but he knew it wasn't
        <p></p>something he could force. So instead, he decided not to
        <p></p>mention it—and just focused on treating Mahiru as if she
        <p></p>was part of his family.
        <p></p>"Is that so? Well, I'll tell Mom. Although I'm warning you,
        <p></p>if you don't have a particular place in mind, my mom will
        <p></p>probably pick whatever she wants. Some amusement park or
        <p></p>shopping mall, most likely. If there's somewhere you want to
        <p></p>go, you should ask, otherwise she might take us to some
        <p></p>weird places."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, as long as I'm going with you and your parents,
        <p></p>anywhere is fine."
        <p></p>"If you say that, my mom's going to take us someplace
        <p></p>strange…"
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled happily at Amane's words, and Amane felt
        <p></p>quietly relieved. Then he told her about some of the odd
        <p></p>destinations they had gone to in the past and coaxed even
        <p></p>more smiles out of her.

        <p></p>Chapter 66: Always by Your Side
        <p></p>Whether it was due to exhaustion from traveling or from
        <p></p>dealing with his parents who were giving him a hard time,
        <p></p>Amane woke up late the next morning—if it could even be
        <p></p>called morning, since it was almost noon by the time he got
        <p></p>out of bed.
        <p></p>Amane picked up his terrycloth blanket from where it had
        <p></p>fallen onto the floor at some point in the night, and as he
        <p></p>began folding it, he let out one big yawn.
        <p></p>…I don't think we have any plans for today.
        <p></p>There was Mahiru's request for the four of them to go on
        <p></p>an outing together, but Amane hadn't told his parents about
        <p></p>that yet, as he had been planning to stay at home for the first
        <p></p>few days to rest. It was summer vacation, so he figured it
        <p></p>was all right to get up close to noon, though he couldn't help
        <p></p>feeling like he was being lazy.
        <p></p>Amane changed his clothes at a leisurely pace. Once he
        <p></p>finished dressing and made it down to the living room, he
        <p></p>saw that of course Mahiru had made it there before him. She
        <p></p>was sitting at the table with his mother and father.
        <p></p>Mahiru was peering down at some large object that
        <p></p>resembled a book, and what she saw was making her eyes
        <p></p>sparkle.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Good morning. Whatcha looking at?"
        <p></p>"Oh, good morning," Mahiru greeted him, without a shred
        <p></p>of sleepiness to be found in her expression. Then she
        <p></p>lowered her gaze to the book on the table again.
        <p></p>Amane looked down, too, curious as to what it could be,
        <p></p>then covered his face with his hand.
        <p></p>"…Wait a minute, why are you looking at a photo album
        <p></p>without me…?"
        <p></p>He saw a picture of a familiar, mud-caked little boy and
        <p></p>groaned.
        <p></p>Amane's parents were the type to take commemorative
        <p></p>photographs, and they treasured their memories, so it wasn't
        <p></p>surprising that they kept photo albums. The problem was
        <p></p>that they were showing one to Mahiru.
        <p></p>The pictures in the album, which was lying wide open,
        <p></p>were of Amane when he was young. It was filled with photos
        <p></p>of a charming and cherubic little boy, who was doing
        <p></p>something embarrassing in most of them.
        <p></p>Amane felt annoyed as he glared at his mother, who had
        <p></p>been showing Mahiru photographs of him covered in mud or
        <p></p>on the verge of tears with obvious delight.
        <p></p>"Oh, did you want to see your cute photos, too? You
        <p></p>should have said something earlier."
        <p></p>"No, I meant don't show her without my permission!"
        <p></p>"…Was it wrong of me to look?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"It's not, but…it's just embarrassing."
        <p></p>"But you're so adorable."
        <p></p>"That's not considered a compliment for a guy, you
        <p></p>know."
        <p></p>If she had called him cool or something, that would have
        <p></p>been better, but adorable was not what he wanted to hear.
        <p></p>Even though he knew she meant his childhood antics were
        <p></p>cute, he wasn't happy about it.
        <p></p>Amane turned away in a huff and could practically feel all
        <p></p>three of them smiling at him.
        <p></p>"Come on, it's fine, isn't it?" his mother prodded.
        <p></p>"Mahiru's clearly crazy about you!"
        <p></p>"I'm sure she just meant that the pictures were cute," he
        <p></p>scoffed.
        <p></p>"O-only because of how different you are now."
        <p></p>"Shiina here must really like you, Amane. As your father,
        <p></p>it makes me happy that you have such a levelheaded girl by
        <p></p>your side."
        <p></p>Out of the corner of his eye, Amane could see Mahiru
        <p></p>staring at the floor, hunched over. He figured that she must
        <p></p>be embarrassed by his parents' praise. However, he was
        <p></p>preoccupied with his own shame over the humiliating
        <p></p>photos his parents had shown off without his permission.
        <p></p>He flopped down onto the sofa in protest, and both of his
        <p></p>parents smiled at him.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Don't pout," his father said. "Isn't it true that you have a
        <p></p>great girl by your side who accepts you for who you are?"
        <p></p>"…That is true, but—"
        <p></p>"The one thing that makes us a little sad is that you didn't
        <p></p>tell us, though."
        <p></p>"Uh—"
        <p></p>Apparently, Shuuto knew that he and Mahiru were dating.
        <p></p>Maybe Shihoko had told him, or maybe he had heard it
        <p></p>directly from Mahiru herself.
        <p></p>"…I know you were probably embarrassed to tell us
        <p></p>everything, but—"
        <p></p>"Even so, we would have liked to know," his mother
        <p></p>interjected. "Although, we did guess."
        <p></p>"Well, as soon as Amane said he was bringing a girl home,
        <p></p>we knew, right? And you two are easy to read anyway."
        <p></p>"Oh, shut up!" Amane exclaimed. "So we're dating! Is that
        <p></p>so bad?"
        <p></p>"My, my, you really can't be honest about your feelings,"
        <p></p>his mother scolded. "Are you sure you want a guy like this,
        <p></p>Mahiru dear?"
        <p></p>"Well, Amane is a shy person…and I love him for it."
        <p></p>"I see; well, there you have it."
        <p></p>"I'm relieved you get along so well."
        <p></p>Amane already felt exhausted as his parents gave Mahiru
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>delighted looks, before turning their attention to him. He
        <p></p>couldn't even work up the spirit to respond.
        <p></p>…I'm in my own home, but I'm at a total disadvantage.
        <p></p>He knew how his parents were and had anticipated
        <p></p>something like this happening, but it was still almost
        <p></p>unbearable. They were being more welcoming and more
        <p></p>familiar with Mahiru than with their own son, and it made
        <p></p>him uncomfortable.
        <p></p>Amane sighed and, with a feeling of desperation, set the
        <p></p>album on his knees and started flipping through it.
        <p></p>The photos that Mahiru had been looking at so happily
        <p></p>were, as he expected, mostly records of embarrassing
        <p></p>moments. Some had been taken to commemorate special
        <p></p>occasions, but the majority showed him looking foolish.
        <p></p>He was disheartened to see that they also had pictures of
        <p></p>him wearing girls' clothes.
        <p></p>Amane had grown slowly, and until about halfway
        <p></p>through middle school, he'd had a very cherubic face, so as a
        <p></p>game, his mother had sometimes dressed him up in clothes
        <p></p>for girls.
        <p></p>In his second year of middle school, he had gotten
        <p></p>remarkably taller, and she hadn't been able to do that
        <p></p>anymore, but it was a bitter pill to swallow being called girly
        <p></p>face behind his back.
        <p></p>…This brings back memories…
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help but think of the boys who'd once
        <p></p>been his close friends before they'd had their falling out. He

        <p></p>had left his hometown specifically to get away from all that.
        <p></p>Now, for better or worse, he cut himself off from his past. He
        <p></p>had no intention of sinking in sentimentality. However, he
        <p></p>did think that there was a chance he might run into those
        <p></p>boys, since they had all gone to the local high school, and
        <p></p>that if he did, it was unlikely to go well.
        <p></p>Amane slammed the album shut to cut off the stream of
        <p></p>troublesome memories, and when he looked up, he saw
        <p></p>Mahiru staring at him.
        <p></p>"Ah, um, are you angry…?" she asked. She sounded
        <p></p>worried.
        <p></p>"Why would you think that? I was simply thinking that it
        <p></p>was nostalgic, that's all." Amane shrugged and placed the
        <p></p>album back on the table.
        <p></p>Amane was irritated by the way his parents had been
        <p></p>treating him, but more than that, he couldn't stand seeing
        <p></p>Mahiru upset. He gently extended a hand and patted her on
        <p></p>the head. Mahiru's eyes opened wide for a moment but
        <p></p>immediately softened as her face slackened into a pleasant
        <p></p>smile.
        <p></p>Shihoko gave them an approving look, but Amane ignored
        <p></p>her and gently stroked Mahiru's hair to soothe her
        <p></p>uneasiness.
        <p></p>By the third day of their visit, Mahiru was thoroughly
        <p></p>familiar with Amane's childhood home.
        <p></p>"Wow, Mahiru dear, you're really good!"
        <p></p>The three of them—Amane's parents and Mahiru—were in
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>the kitchen, wearing aprons, chummily making some kind of
        <p></p>sweet. Amane was not participating. He hadn't even been
        <p></p>invited, so all he could do was sit in the living room alone
        <p></p>and watch his girlfriend and his parents from a distance.
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru had traveled a long way to be there, so
        <p></p>Amane's parents were entertaining Mahiru at every
        <p></p>opportunity. They seemed to prefer her over their own son,
        <p></p>and the three of them seemed to be having a grand old time
        <p></p>together.
        <p></p>It wasn't that he didn't understand why his parents doted
        <p></p>on his girlfriend, since she was such a cute, honest, and nice
        <p></p>girl, but they were neglecting their only son.
        <p></p>He didn't particularly need them for anything, or want to
        <p></p>be bothered, but he still had mixed feelings about being
        <p></p>abandoned like that.
        <p></p>Of course, he was happy that Mahiru seemed to enjoy the
        <p></p>attention from his parents. He didn't mind sitting out a bit if
        <p></p>it meant that Mahiru, who had always yearned for a close
        <p></p>family, got to experience one, even if it wasn't hers.
        <p></p>The one thing that bothered him a little was that while his
        <p></p>parents were entertaining Mahiru, Amane hardly got to
        <p></p>spend any time with her.
        <p></p>I guess it's fine since we'll be together when we get back.
        <p></p>He knew that, once they returned to their apartments, he
        <p></p>would have plenty of time alone with Mahiru, but be that as
        <p></p>it may, Amane still felt a bit conflicted.
        <p></p>For the time being, Mahiru and his parents were
        <p></p>preoccupied with each other, so in order to escape his
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>discomfort, Amane left the living room and went back to his
        <p></p>bedroom.
        <p></p>He sat down cross-legged in front of a folding table and
        <p></p>opened up a book he had brought.
        <p></p>He didn't have anything to do, and he had taken almost
        <p></p>everything with him to his new place when he moved, so this
        <p></p>was the only way he had to pass the time. In any case, they
        <p></p>had tests coming up right after summer break, so he needed
        <p></p>to study to maintain his rank, and he liked studying anyway,
        <p></p>so it wasn't a pain.
        <p></p>Amane passed the time quietly, lost in his studies like a
        <p></p>good student.
        <p></p>Even though the workbook was new, thanks to his daily
        <p></p>efforts, he was able to solve the problems in it without much
        <p></p>trouble. His parents had always told him to study hard, and
        <p></p>more importantly, he had been working diligently to keep up
        <p></p>with Mahiru, so now he was seeing the results of those
        <p></p>efforts.
        <p></p>I'm sure it's lively down in the kitchen…, he thought
        <p></p>absentmindedly as he checked his answers, drawing red
        <p></p>circles on his paper. He had made a few careless mistakes
        <p></p>but was relieved to see his answers were mostly correct.
        <p></p>Amane still felt uncomfortable, despite the stillness of his
        <p></p>bedroom.
        <p></p>It's always been normal for me to spend time by myself.
        <p></p>Since when have I felt like something is missing without
        <p></p>someone by my side?
        <p></p>Without a doubt, it was because of Mahiru. He had gotten
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>used to having her around, so he now felt weirdly incomplete
        <p></p>when he was alone.
        <p></p>Idly spinning his red pen around and around in his hands,
        <p></p>Amane let out a small sigh. He would finish the workbook
        <p></p>soon, a thought that should have made him happy, but just
        <p></p>as he was about to exchange his red pen for a mechanical
        <p></p>pencil with a mournful grumble, the sound of three hard
        <p></p>knocks sounded from the bedroom door.
        <p></p>"Amane?" he heard Mahiru's reserved voice ask.
        <p></p>He had thought she was cooking down in the kitchen, but
        <p></p>when he glanced at the clock, he saw that two hours had
        <p></p>passed. They had probably finished already.
        <p></p>"What's up?"
        <p></p>"Nothing, just—you disappeared without us noticing,
        <p></p>so…"
        <p></p>"I was only studying. I had some time, so…"
        <p></p>He could hardly believe that two hours had gone by, but
        <p></p>that just showed how focused he had been. Actually, in a
        <p></p>way, he had been more distracted than focused since he'd
        <p></p>only started studying to drive other thoughts from his mind.
        <p></p>"…Is that so? Um, is it okay for me to come into your
        <p></p>room?"
        <p></p>"It's fine, but wouldn't you rather be talking to my
        <p></p>parents?"
        <p></p>"…Right now, I want to talk to you, Amane."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>She was probably concerned about him. If not, she
        <p></p>wouldn't have bothered to come visit him in his room. He
        <p></p>thought he was acting immature with his responses, but
        <p></p>there was no reason for him to turn her away, so he opened
        <p></p>the door and said, "Come on in."
        <p></p>On the other side stood Mahiru. She was holding a tray
        <p></p>and looking at him timidly.
        <p></p>On the tray were two café au laits and two cream puffs,
        <p></p>which was apparently what they had been making earlier.
        <p></p>"Pardon the intrusion…"
        <p></p>Mahiru entered hesitantly, making Amane feel a little
        <p></p>awkward, too.
        <p></p>He hurriedly cleared away his workbook and writing
        <p></p>implements, pulled out a cushion for Mahiru, then took the
        <p></p>tray from her and set it down on the folding table.
        <p></p>The beautifully baked cream puffs were magnificent to
        <p></p>behold, like something you would buy from a bakery. And
        <p></p>since Mahiru had made them, Amane knew they would be
        <p></p>delicious.
        <p></p>"We just finished making them. They're not that chilled,
        <p></p>but…"
        <p></p>"Mm, thanks."
        <p></p>He was full of gratitude that she had gone to the trouble of
        <p></p>bringing them up to him, so he said so honestly.
        <p></p>But for some reason, Mahiru cast her eyes downward
        <p></p>uneasily.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Amane, you're not mad…are you?"
        <p></p>"Why do you ask that?"
        <p></p>"Th-the air around you feels prickly. Like it's hard to get
        <p></p>close to you."
        <p></p>Apparently, she had picked up on the fact that he was
        <p></p>upset, although he wasn't actually mad, like she seemed to
        <p></p>think. Amane's feelings were very complicated, and he did
        <p></p>feel lonely. But he wasn't angry whatsoever. After all, there
        <p></p>was nothing wrong with what his parents or Mahiru were
        <p></p>doing, Amane was just in a funk all on his own.
        <p></p>"I'm really not mad at all. It's just—I was feeling lonely
        <p></p>because you got taken away," he admitted.
        <p></p>"Ah…well, that's…"
        <p></p>"Sorry. I know you're having fun spending time with my
        <p></p>mom and dad. I'm just being sulky. It's childish, even for
        <p></p>me." He laughed and shrugged, then took a sip of the café au
        <p></p>lait she had poured for him.
        <p></p>Amane knew that Mahiru was hungry for a loving family,
        <p></p>and he felt bad about leaving her alone earlier. He should
        <p></p>have been enjoying watching her, instead of worrying about
        <p></p>feeling out of place.
        <p></p>Amane was happy as long as Mahiru was happy, but it felt
        <p></p>sad to be left behind, and he was the one who had chosen to
        <p></p>isolate himself further. He had selfishly worked himself into
        <p></p>a bad mood, and he couldn't blame that on Mahiru or his
        <p></p>parents.
        <p></p>Amane set down his cup and sighed, and Mahiru slowly
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>looked up at him—then quickly launched herself at his chest.
        <p></p>To be more exact, she got close and leaned her body against
        <p></p>his chest, but Amane was caught off guard by the sudden
        <p></p>physical contact.
        <p></p>He wondered what was wrong all of a sudden, but for the
        <p></p>moment, he gently patted Mahiru's back to comfort her. She
        <p></p>slowly lifted her face and looked Amane directly in the eyes.
        <p></p>"…Of course I have fun spending time with your parents.
        <p></p>It does make me happy, but I need you to know that my
        <p></p>favorite thing is being with you, Amane," she whispered,
        <p></p>then brought her lips to his cheek nervously.
        <p></p>By the time he had registered the faint, soft pressure,
        <p></p>Mahiru had already pulled away.
        <p></p>When he saw her cheeks, suddenly redder than they had
        <p></p>been before, and her eyes welling with tears, Amane
        <p></p>instinctively planted his own kiss on her soft cheek.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>…I've been a fool.
        <p></p>He had been acting like a complete idiot, pouting for no
        <p></p>reason, when Mahiru had been so concerned about him.
        <p></p>He realized again how much he loved her, and he tried to
        <p></p>express his overflowing feelings with that action.
        <p></p>Even if it was just on the cheek, Amane wasn't used to
        <p></p>kissing yet. Mahiru was the same and shivered when
        <p></p>Amane's lips made contact.
        <p></p>At first, she seemed like she was going to run away out of
        <p></p>shame, but as Amane held her tight and touched her gently,
        <p></p>she gradually relaxed into his arms and closed her eyes in
        <p></p>comfort.
        <p></p>Mahiru bashfully kissed Amane's cheek in return, and
        <p></p>overcome by her cuteness, he squeezed her even tighter.
        <p></p>"…Hey, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>After they had kissed each other on the cheeks for a while,
        <p></p>Amane peered down into Mahiru's eyes. She looked back up
        <p></p>at him with an expression filled with both embarrassment
        <p></p>and joy.
        <p></p>"Listen, tomorrow, let's go out together. My parents have
        <p></p>work."
        <p></p>"Just the two of us?"
        <p></p>"I haven't shown you around my hometown yet, have I?
        <p></p>Though, it's not like there's much to see, not like where we
        <p></p>live."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>He had only suggested it because he wanted to spend time
        <p></p>with her, but Mahiru's eyes widened, then she put on an
        <p></p>even softer smile than when they had been kissing.
        <p></p>"Let's go… I'll go anywhere, as long as I'm with you."
        <p></p>"Uh—"
        <p></p>"But today, I want to stay here like this for a little while
        <p></p>longer… Your parents also told me I should spend some time
        <p></p>with you."
        <p></p>"It's none of their business…is what I'd like to say, but
        <p></p>they saw right through me. I guess I am bad at hiding my
        <p></p>feelings."
        <p></p>It seemed Amane's parents had been worried about him
        <p></p>as well.
        <p></p>Amane laughed at how needlessly foolish he had been as
        <p></p>he slowly pulled away from Mahiru.
        <p></p>She looked hurt for a moment, but then Amane pointed at
        <p></p>the cream puffs and whispered, "I want to eat the sweets
        <p></p>that you made," and she immediately cast her eyes down
        <p></p>bashfully.
        <p></p>"…Shall we eat them together?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>Instead of embracing, Amane sat by Mahiru's side,
        <p></p>holding her hand and smiling warmly.

        <p></p>Chapter 67: A Chance Meeting with the Past 2
        <p></p>"The two of you are going out today, right?" Shihoko
        <p></p>inquired as the four of them took their seats at the breakfast
        <p></p>table.
        <p></p>Amane's parents looked very pleased, and Amane started
        <p></p>to regret telling them that he and Mahiru had made plans.
        <p></p>But his mother didn't mean to tease them. "I'm sure
        <p></p>you're bored being cooped up in the house," she added
        <p></p>quickly.
        <p></p>"Well, we're not really going anywhere in particular," he
        <p></p>replied, "just taking a little walk."
        <p></p>"We haven't gone anywhere yet, so I'm looking forward to
        <p></p>it," Mahiru added.
        <p></p>In the three days since they had arrived, Mahiru had gone
        <p></p>shopping with Amane's father on the first day, but aside 3
        <p></p>from that, they had passed the time at the house. Amane's
        <p></p>parents had been keeping Mahiru busy, and it wasn't like
        <p></p>she was going to wander aimlessly in an unfamiliar
        <p></p>neighborhood.
        <p></p>Amane had expected his parents to take them out to
        <p></p>places, but instead they had chosen to relax at home, so he
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>figured he would at least show Mahiru around town.
        <p></p>"There's really nothing around here except parks and a
        <p></p>supermarket, you know? It's a different story if we go into
        <p></p>town, though. Do you want to go?"
        <p></p>"No, taking a stroll with you sounds just fine. I'm happy
        <p></p>just walking together."
        <p></p>"…Is that so?"
        <p></p>He knew the answer. Mahiru didn't have any particular
        <p></p>place she wanted to visit—just going out and spending time
        <p></p>with Amane was enough for her. Her affection gradually
        <p></p>warmed Amane's chest. He could see by her expression that
        <p></p>she really was happy being with him, and he found himself
        <p></p>looking away out of embarrassment and joy.
        <p></p>"You know, they already seem like they're more than just
        <p></p>dating," his father remarked.
        <p></p>"We were like that when we were young, too, Shuuto," his
        <p></p>mother replied.
        <p></p>"No, you weren't as well-behaved as Shiina here."
        <p></p>"Oh, that's not nice!"
        <p></p>"But I thought you were cute just the way you were."
        <p></p>"Well!"
        <p></p>Shihoko blushed as Shuuto complimented her. Thinking
        <p></p>that it was too early to be listening to that kind of thing,
        <p></p>Amane focused on stuffing his face with the omelet his
        <p></p>mother had made for breakfast.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>It was tasty enough, but even so, he really did prefer 2
        <p></p>Mahiru's cooking—and not just because she was his
        <p></p>girlfriend. Now that he was accustomed to Mahiru's cooking,
        <p></p>he found his mother's food somewhat disappointing. 9
        <p></p>He looked over at Mahiru, thinking that he should ask her
        <p></p>to make breakfast some other day, and saw her looking at
        <p></p>his parents with a mixture of adoration, envy, and acute
        <p></p>bashfulness.
        <p></p>Amane knew what she must be thinking and began feeling
        <p></p>embarrassed, too.
        <p></p>…Of course, I don't think we could ever be as lovey-dovey 7
        <p></p>as those two…
        <p></p>Even so, he did think it would be nice if they could get
        <p></p>that close, to have what Mahiru was imagining. He did want
        <p></p>that, even though he couldn't admit it out loud yet.
        <p></p>Looking again at his parents, who had always been
        <p></p>affectionate toward one another, Amane imagined his own
        <p></p>future someday and blushed slightly.
        <p></p>"Well, should we get going?"
        <p></p>Shortly after his parents left for work, Amane turned to
        <p></p>Mahiru, who was sitting on the sofa.
        <p></p>It was still morning, and they weren't planning on walking
        <p></p>that far. They were just going to take a relaxed stroll around
        <p></p>the neighborhood, so he figured they would easily make it
        <p></p>back in time for lunch—Mahiru was planning to make
        <p></p>carbonara. They would return to the house by midday, so
        <p></p>they wouldn't be outside for that long.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Yep. I'm all ready."
        <p></p>"Well, there's not much to get ready for… We're planning
        <p></p>to go into town another time anyway, right?"
        <p></p>"…On a d-date?"
        <p></p>"Yeah. But today, we can take it easy."
        <p></p>Amane figured Mahiru would want plenty of time to get
        <p></p>ready for a real date. Today, they were just going on a simple
        <p></p>outing. Even if it met the strictest definition of a date, it
        <p></p>didn't feel like one for either of them. 1
        <p></p>A date was a special occasion, and Amane wanted to plan
        <p></p>a whole day together. This was simply a casual stroll.
        <p></p>Mahiru couldn't conceal her delight at the idea of going on
        <p></p>a date soon. She broke into a soft, euphoric smile.
        <p></p>"I'm looking forward to it."
        <p></p>"Mm. I still have to come up with a plan, so don't get too
        <p></p>excited yet."
        <p></p>"I told you, as long as I'm with you, anywhere is fine."
        <p></p>"I know that, but since we're going to the trouble, I think
        <p></p>it would be nice to go someplace that will make you happy."
        <p></p>Mahiru had told him that she was satisfied by just
        <p></p>spending time together, and Amane could see that in her
        <p></p>expression, too. Nevertheless, as her boyfriend, he wanted to
        <p></p>impress her.
        <p></p>"Well, that's a discussion for next week. For now, let's go
        <p></p>on a normal walk, shall we?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>Amane offered her his hand, and she accepted with a little
        <p></p>squeeze.
        <p></p>That made him feel nervous, and he smiled a little to hide
        <p></p>his embarrassment as they left the house, holding hands.
        <p></p>Even though Amane hadn't been home in about a year,
        <p></p>the area around his childhood home hadn't changed much,
        <p></p>and as he guided her down familiar streets, he began feeling
        <p></p>a little nostalgic.
        <p></p>They continued holding hands as they walked, and people
        <p></p>looked at Mahiru enviously as the young couple who looked
        <p></p>the part of students on vacation passed by. Amane found
        <p></p>this a little funny and laughed.
        <p></p>The stares alone were proof of what a beauty Mahiru was,
        <p></p>which was a good thing, but the number of people who
        <p></p>stopped to look was amusing.
        <p></p>"Why are you laughing?"
        <p></p>"Hmm? Because you're so beautiful. You're turning
        <p></p>heads."
