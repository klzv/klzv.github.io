        "Must be nice to have a partner to play house."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "She's not really my partner. And what about Chitose?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Chi? Well, sure. So long as I can keep her from getting carried away with her weird<p></p>
        <p></p>
        experiments anyway. I mean, she knows how to cook, for sure."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Does she ever make anything that's not weird?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's just part of her charm, all right?" Itsuki's eyes darted from side to side.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Whatever you need to tell yourself, man."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        For better or worse, there was rarely a dull moment with Chitose. She might've looked<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like an ordinary high school girl, and apparently she even had some surprising talents<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on the home front, but when the mood struck her, she was liable to cause all sorts of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        trouble.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, it sounds like she's going to get it together after we're married, so—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How long do you think it's going to take to get your dad to accept her…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki's father, who was oddly strict about dating in a way that you didn't see much<p></p>
        <p></p>
        these days, had never approved of Chitose. He would definitely have something to say<p></p>
        <p></p>
        if he heard that they were planning to get married.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose's parents, on the other hand, were apparently ready to welcome Itsuki into<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the family at any time, which always confused Amane… Wasn't it usually the other way<p></p>
        <p></p>
        around?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, once we're adults, he'll have to come around. I'll threaten him with not seeing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his grandkids and all that. This is one fight where I can't back down and just do what<p></p>
        <p></p>
        my dad wants."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki made a show of shrugging like he didn't think much of it, but Amane noticed the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        serious look in his eyes. He was obviously not planning to budge on this issue.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had always understood the extent to which Itsuki loved Chitose, so he chose to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        encourage them, admiring how amazing it was that they were thinking about<p></p>
        <p></p>
        marriage even while they were still in high school.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Well, I think you're probably not one to back down until you've got a ring on her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        finger, so I wish you the best of luck."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah. And good luck to you, too," Itsuki replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "At what?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, with you-know-who… Right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I don't really have that kind of relationship with her. Don't make things up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane turned away sharply, but he could hear Itsuki's bright, cheerful laughter.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane purchased everything he needed at the supermarket and headed home. When<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he got there, Mahiru was already in his apartment, sitting on the sofa, waiting in her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        usual spot. She had her knees pulled up and was squeezing a cushion to her chest. The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        position made her look a little childish, but her expression wasn't sulky or dour.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Rather, she looked embarrassed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Well, thank goodness she's wearing a long skirt, Amane thought as he carefully averted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his eyes and went to put the dinner ingredients away in the refrigerator. When he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        returned to the living room, Mahiru was still sitting there waiting for him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Amane sat down next to her, Mahiru carefully averted her eyes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru, thank you for the gift yesterday. It was really delicious."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm glad to hear it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane thought that if she was nervous about what happened yesterday, the best thing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to do was to show her how much he appreciated it. Mahiru continued squeezing the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cushion but didn't say anything else.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What would you like in return?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's not why I gave it to you…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I know that, but well, give a favor, get a favor, right? It wouldn't be very gentlemanly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of me if all I do is take, take, take."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane believed that a man should always strive to pay back whatever he received.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Since Mahiru had gone out of her way to make him such delicious treats, he intended<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to give her something equally splendid in return. She hadn't made chocolates for any<p></p>
        <p></p>
        other boy, after all, yet she had made something special that she knew he would like.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It must have been a lot of work, all for his sake.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I already get so many things from you, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Actually, I'm pretty sure I'm the one who's been on the receiving end. You're always<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cooking for me and stuff. I always feel like I'm just taking advantage of you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I do those things because I like doing them. Amane, you probably don't even realize<p></p>
        <p></p>
        how much you've done for me. But as far as I'm concerned, I've already received more<p></p>
        <p></p>
        than enough, so I don't need anything else."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane genuinely could not imagine what he might have offered Mahiru. It seemed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like she was always doing things for him, and he wanted to pay her back for all her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        kindness… but the tally was apparently very different from Mahiru's perspective.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, that is that, and this is this. I'll try to think of something you might like."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        No matter what Amane might have done for her until now, he still wanted to get her a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        White Day present. It was tradition to repay any Valentine's Day chocolates on White<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Day, after all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane stared firmly at Mahiru, indicating that he had no intention of giving in on this,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        until she nodded, her eyes wandering around the room a bit.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Fine."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, so I've got about a month to figure out what to give you. It would be great if<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I could find something that you would really like."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Do you have time for a search like that?" Mahiru asked, sounding slightly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        exasperated. "Next week we have final exams, and then right after, there's the closing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ceremony."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Sure enough, finals were only days away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There had still been a lingering aftertaste of Valentine's Day at school that day, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        soon it would be replaced with the typical prickly energy of pre-exam anxiety.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wasn't particularly nervous about it, though.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If the exams go the same as usual," he said, "I'm sure I'll pass, so I'm not going to stress<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about them now. Same for you, I bet."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's true," Mahiru replied. "I make a point to get my work done with time to spare."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was always diligent when it came to keeping up with his classwork, so he rarely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had any trouble with tests. He knew he could maintain his usual grades without any<p></p>
        <p></p>
        last-minute cram sessions. At most, he might spend a little extra time reviewing the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        material right before each test.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had actually already completed all the coursework in advance, and she was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        just as diligent about studying as Amane was, so he had never seen her panic about<p></p>
        <p></p>
        schoolwork. Instead, exam days with their shortened schedules were probably like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        half days for her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, don't expect too much."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Okay. I'll treasure anything you give me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, don't get carried away now."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I've been taking very good care of Mr. Bear."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm glad to hear it." Amane smiled.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, Mahiru really treasured the stuffed bear he had given her on her birthday.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had also seen her using the key holder, and she seemed to be taking good care of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that as well. He had worried a little bit about how the stuffed bear was faring, but…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        from all indications, Mahiru really liked it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could feel his mouth curling up into a grin when he heard Mahiru cutely refer<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to Mr. Bear, but he thought she might scowl at him if she caught him smiling, so he put<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on his best poker face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If we're still hanging out when her next birthday rolls around, what sort of thing can I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        give her…? he wondered anxiously.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Suddenly, Amane noticed that Mahiru was staring at him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Come to think of it, I don't know when your birthday is," she said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh, mine? Mine is November eighth."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Guess I never told her, huh?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When she heard his birthday, Mahiru's eyes narrowed… ever so slightly. They had been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        spending a lot of time together for several months, so he had come to understand that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expression as the one she made when she was angry or annoyed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Hey, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Didn't we already know each other by then?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, I guess so."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Why didn't you say anything?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Because you never asked. You didn't tell me your birthday, either, remember? I only<p></p>
        <p></p>
        knew because I saw it on your school ID."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Urk—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And we weren't that close back then anyway. If I had told you my birthday, you would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have wondered why in the world I was bringing it up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Also, Amane hadn't wanted to come across like he was fishing for a present or<p></p>
        <p></p>
        anything. That would not have been a good look. So he hadn't seen the need to tell her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about his birthday—they hadn't had that kind of relationship back then.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…But—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You really don't have to worry about it," Amane insisted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Fine…," Mahiru said. "But we'll definitely celebrate your birthday properly this year."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As she said that, she turned to him and grasped his sleeve tightly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru obviously didn't want this unequal situation to continue. He had never seen<p></p>
        <p></p>
        someone so serious about a birthday before.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane couldn't help but grin—not his normal, wry smirk, but an honest, happy smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After all, nothing could make him happier than hearing that Mahiru felt the same way<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he did… and that she was thinking about spending time together in the future.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So you're planning to stay with me at least that long, are you?" he prodded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's bright, caramel-coloured eyes went wide—and then, in an instant, her face<p></p>
        <p></p>
        flushed red, and where she had been gripping his sleeve a moment ago, she whacked<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him with the cushion, obviously trying to hide her embarrassment. Amane could feel<p></p>
        <p></p>
        himself smiling again at how charming she was.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Well, I suppose I don't hate the thought… I always feel so calm when we're together.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It's nice."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh really? Thanks."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But you know I don't really… have any other intentions."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I knew that already." Amane nodded. "And that's fine with me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        For some reason, Mahiru looked slightly disappointed.<p></p>
        <p></p>

        22 White Day<p></p>
        Amane was always diligent with his studies and serious about his lessons, so he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        completed his final exams without any particular difficulty.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Going over his tests with Mahiru, he found that he'd gotten the same grades as usual.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He always did well enough at school and never had to worry about being held back a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        grade or anything like that.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki also got fairly good scores, and even Chitose had apparently done well enough<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to avoid a failing mark, so the people Amane was closest to were in no danger of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        repeating a year, either.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        All that was left was the graduation ceremony to send off the third-year students, which<p></p>
        <p></p>
        didn't have much to do with them, and after that, to wait for the closing ceremony.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Between the two ceremonies, however, was one very important date.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…What do I give her?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The day was fast approaching for all those who had prevailed on Valentine's Day to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        repay their gifts. Both Mahiru and Chitose had given Amane chocolates, so naturally<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he was planning to give them each something in return. The only problem was that he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had no idea what to give Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose's gift was easy enough—he planned to combine a White Day cake from the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        store where she had purchased their Christmas cake with a sundry of merchandise<p></p>
        <p></p>
        based on the characters she liked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was sure that someone like Chitose, who was more interested in sweets than<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sweethearts, would appreciate that. It was an obvious choice.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        But Mahiru remained a dilemma.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was sure that Mahiru would graciously accept anything he got her—the thought<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mattered more to her than the actual gift. But he wanted to pick out something that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would make her really happy. The trouble was that he honestly didn't know much<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about the kinds of things she liked. He knew she had a taste for sweets and liked cute<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stuff like most other girls, but beyond that, he was lost. Mahiru was not an easy person<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to shop for.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane remembered her telling him that she wanted a new whetstone, but that didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seem like a particularly charming gift, and he couldn't really afford something like that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        anyway. And for this occasion, it seemed more appropriate to give her something she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would enjoy, rather than something practical.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane started his search by looking over the White Day display at a nearby department<p></p>
        <p></p>
        store, but he couldn't picture Mahiru being truly happy with any of the things there.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was hoping for a reaction like he'd gotten when he'd given her the stuffed bear.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Of course, it would be boring to give her a stuffed animal a second time.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There were many adorable stuffed animals on display, but Amane decided that a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        repeat gift lacked originality.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        On the other hand, when he tried to imagine what would impress her, Amane's poor<p></p>
        <p></p>
        imagination could only come up with cosmetics or fashion accessories.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        But he knew less than nothing about cosmetics, and he wasn't sure whether they had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the kind of relationship where he could confidently pick out fashionable things for her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He didn't think she would interpret it as anything strange, but he wasn't sure it would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        really impress her, either.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane thought that their relationship was pretty good, and if he were Itsuki and she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were Chitose, an accessory would be an obvious choice, but Amane just didn't think it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was the right move here.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Racked with worry, Amane lingered restlessly by the gifts corner. He imagined that he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        must look awfully suspicious. Even though he had taken the precaution of dressing up<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to go out, he thought that a single guy hanging around the cute goods had to seem<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shady.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was grumbling to himself about his options, when from behind him a voice asked,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Are you looking for anything in particular?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Amane turned around, there was a young woman in a store apron standing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        there smiling. She had probably noticed his distress as he helplessly wandered the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        aisles.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, um… I'm not sure what to get for a White Day present."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So nothing in the display jumps out at you? Well, there are some things in our regular<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stock that are also popular White Day gifts. Let me show you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, no, that's not exactly it… You see, our relationship is rather hard to define, and I'm<p></p>
        <p></p>
        not sure what I can get her that won't be… too much."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Meaning what?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, she's not my girlfriend, but we are pretty close, so… this is just an example, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I'm wondering whether she would be happy to get an accessory or something from a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        guy she doesn't like… that way."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Amane explained his predicament, the store clerk let a little giggle slip out. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seemed to find his dilemma quite charming.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I've seen a lot of gentlemen come through here with the same sort of worries."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So what did they end up doing?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "They were all worried, too, but most of them decided to buy something. If you're close<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to this girl, she'll probably appreciate anything you give her."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane felt relieved to hear someone else say that, though of course the prospect of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        picking an accessory for Mahiru was still fairly daunting.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She was very particular about her attire, and the bits and pieces he had seen her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wearing before had all been quite elegant. Amane had no confidence that he could<p></p>
        <p></p>
        select something that would meet the standards of such a sophisticated young woman.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sir, would you like me to show you some of the items in the corner over there that are<p></p>
        <p></p>
        popular with our female customers?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Yes, please," Amane said gratefully, straightening up a little.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And so you bought something?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Amane told Itsuki about his shopping trip, his friend looked at him and laughed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pretty much the same way the clerk had the day before.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The two of them were eating lunch together in the cafeteria, and when the topic of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        White Day came up, Amane had spilled the beans.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Geez, keep it down!" Amane insisted. "Anyway, I was worried that giving her an<p></p>
        <p></p>
        accessory might weird her out, since we're not dating."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're such a coward! A man should have more nerve, more spirit! And anyway, I have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a feeling that she'll be happy with anything as long as it comes from you, ya know?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I guess so, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was the kind of girl who would graciously accept any gift, but Amane wanted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to give her a present that she would genuinely enjoy and want to use, so he had been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stressing out trying to choose something good.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So what did you end up buying?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…A rose-gold bracelet with a flower pattern."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had thought that the soft warmth of the rose gold would suit her better than
        <p></p>
        cool-looking silver or extravagant yellow gold. Of course, he was just in high school, so he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        couldn't afford real precious metals, so it was only gold-plated, but he had been careful<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to select a design that seemed to suit Mahiru's style.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Really? That seems like exactly the kind of thing she'll like, man."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…She won't be weirded out?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No way; you're worrying too much. Why are you always so negative about this<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stuff…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "She's the only girl I've ever seriously thought about giving a present to."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His mother didn't count, and he wasn't thinking of Chitose, either. And anyway, he'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        only gotten Chitose a confection that he already knew she liked, so that present felt<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like it was on a different level.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You really don't have any confidence with this stuff, huh…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And why should I? I mean… it's Mahiru!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "She was happy with the teddy bear, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, that's true, but—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane, it's all about feeling, man, feeling. You've already spent the cash and chosen<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the gift, so all that's left now is to put some emotion behind it." Itsuki made it sound<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so simple.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If it was that easy," Amane grumbled, "I wouldn't have any problem." He pressed a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hand to his forehead.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It seemed he would be plagued with doubt over his decision until White Day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When the fateful day arrived, Amane was waiting for Mahiru in his apartment, wearing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        an unusually nervous expression. The mood at school had reminded him of Valentine's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Day. The boys who had come out on top a month earlier were anxious about giving<p></p>
        <p></p>
        their return gifts, and the girls were waiting with barely contained anticipation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Incidentally, Yuuta had faithfully returned each and every gift, repaying each one with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        an identical box of sweets. Amane's eyes glazed over when he considered that even<p></p>
        <p></p>
        doing the very minimum must have cost Yuuta tens of thousands of yen.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In any case, there was no way that Amane would have given Mahiru his present at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        school, so now he waited for her to arrive at his apartment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had rushed home from school to compose himself, but try as he might, he was just<p></p>
        <p></p>
        not used to giving gifts. His nerves were threatening to get the better of him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Just this once, he wasn't wearing his usual sweatpants and T-shirt, but rather a layered<p></p>
        <p></p>
        outfit with a gray V-neck sweater over a white shirt, paired with chino pants. He'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tried to look a little less sloppy than usual, but he wasn't entirely sure how his new<p></p>
        <p></p>
        look would be received.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was still struggling to get ahold of himself when he heard the sound of the front<p></p>
        <p></p>
        door unlocking. He sat bolt upright, startled.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was Mahiru, using her duplicate key, as usual. When she came into the living room,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she looked at Amane and froze.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, wh-why is your hair like that?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, uh, it is White Day, ya know, and I wanted to dress up a little, so I thought I had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        better try to clean up my act today… If you don't like it, I can go fix it, though."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He'd obviously succeeded in surprising Mahiru, and she didn't seem to be taking it too<p></p>
        <p></p>
        well—but when he stood up, she waved a hand in front of her face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Th-that's not what I meant. I was just surprised, is all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I see."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could tell that something was up with Mahiru. He was starting to think he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        should have stuck to his usual getup.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was fidgeting as she took a seat beside him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You still look uncomfortable. Should I go change?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "N-no, it's fine, it's just… It's a lot."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What do you mean?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "W-well, you're always so low-key. I feel like I can relax around you. But… when you're<p></p>
        <p></p>
        all done up like that, it makes it hard to stay calm."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "In that case, I'll take it off."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru grasped his sleeve tightly. "…I said it's fine."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When she looked up at him with dewy eyes and flushed cheeks, Amane felt his heart<p></p>
        <p></p>
        leap in his chest. He knew she wasn't doing it on purpose, but she was really making<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it hard for him to maintain his composure. It didn't help that she was close enough<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that he could smell her sweet perfume.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was incredibly aware of the way she was fidgeting restlessly and how tightly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she was holding on to him. Now both of them were blushing, and it made the situation<p></p>
        <p></p>
        even more uncomfortable.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's eyes darted restlessly around the room. "Well, uh, okay," he stammered. Then,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in an effort to move past the awkward moment, he gracelessly thrust a paper bag<p></p>
        <p></p>
        toward Mahiru. "Here. It's your gift. Don't expect too much."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Thank you. May I open it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Okay."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It would be embarrassing for her to open it right in front of him, but he wasn't going<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to say no. Amane had purchased a small box lined with velvet to hold the bracelet, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        now he worried that it was too much for the gift he'd chosen.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's slender white fingers gently opened the dark-blue box. Inside was the rose<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gold bracelet he had purchased the other day, as well as some folded paper he had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        included as a bonus.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru didn't seem to be into gaudy accessories, so he had emphasized elegance and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        simplicity when choosing the flower bracelet.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Here and there it was decorated with sparkling glass crystals that caught the light and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        glittered. The design was both cute and refined.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's caramel-coloured eyes gazed for a long time at the brilliance of the rose-gold<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bracelet in the box.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You don't like it…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, I think it's lovely."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's a relief. I picked that because I thought it would look good on you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Thank you very much."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's eyes were downcast, as though she was embarrassed by what he had said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Watching her, Amane felt his breath catch in his throat.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…And this is?" Mahiru asked, noticing the paper he had included in the box.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wanted to look away, but he couldn't take his eyes off Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, that?" Amane scratched his cheek in embarrassment. "Well, um, I kinda thought<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the bracelet wasn't enough somehow, so… You're always taking care of me, and um, I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        want to be able to grant any requests you might have, so…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The paper he had put in the box as a bonus gift was a booklet of I'll do anything you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        say tickets, like the kind a small child might make. The bunch of tickets was good for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        three uses and featured a hand-drawn illustration of a bear. Amane thought it had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        turned out rather well, given his skills anyway.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Since Mahiru was always looking after him, he wanted to do what he could to help her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out whenever she might need it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That was the idea behind the coupons anyway, but Mahiru seemed more focused on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the illustrated bear. Her shoulders trembled with laughter.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Pfft-ha-ha, did you draw this yourself, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh hush," Amane said sullenly. "I'm no artist. So what?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, I think it's great. You chose it for a reason." Mahiru's innocent smile made it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        obvious that she hadn't really meant to criticize. "…So can I use them right away?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "On what?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane hadn't expected her to want to exercise her privilege so suddenly, but if Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had a favor that she wanted to ask of him, he intended to grant her request to the very<p></p>
        <p></p>
        best of his ability.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru gently turned the box containing the bracelet around to face him. "…Amane,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        please help me put this on."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, come on, you don't need a ticket to ask me that," he said with a troubled smile as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he listened to her modest request. "Now, if the lady would allow me to assist…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru held out the box, and his expression softened when he saw how cute she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looked. After he took the box from her, he set it down on his knees and removed the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bracelet, noting the smooth sound of the delicate chain sliding across the velvet.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Gingerly, he opened the clasp and gently wound the chain around her wrist. Finally, he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        carefully fastened it back together. The warm rose gold sparkled on Mahiru's delicate<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wrist.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I was right, this color does suit Mahiru's light skin.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Since hers was a refined sort of beauty, Amane had guessed that something<p></p>
        <p></p>
        conservative and elegant would suit her better than something flashy, and he felt a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        surge of pride when he realized that he had made the correct selection.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, that looks good."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Thank you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Thinking it wouldn't do to hold on to her for too long, he let go of her hand, and Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        brought the arm bearing the bracelet up to her chest, holding it gently, and smiled<p></p>
        <p></p>
        softly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That sweet, unabashed smile, the soft shape of Mahiru's lips, the slight flush on her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        innocent cheeks… It was both childish and womanly, guileless and refined. Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        found he couldn't turn away from her, no matter how hard he tried.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …This is too much…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Knowing that he was the reason for Mahiru's smile was almost more than he could<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stand. Amane tried to tear his eyes away and bring his soaring heart back down to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        earth, but in the end, he kept staring at her until she noticed and hid her face in a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cushion.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So how was White Day?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The following day Itsuki asked him for a report. Amane did his best to give him a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        humorless scowl.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki had been considerate enough not to ask while they were in school, but on the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        way home, they stopped at a fast-food joint, and the moment they sat down, he began<p></p>
        <p></p>
        digging for details with a grin.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had only come to eat some fries because he was craving something salty.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Now he thought it probably would have been better not to come if he was going to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have to put up with this kind of questioning.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What's there to tell…? I just gave her the bracelet like normal."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And was she happy to get it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…More or less," Amane answered in the calmest voice he could muster.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        True, he hadn't gotten quite the reaction he'd been expecting, but judging by her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        earnest smile, he was sure she'd been happy with the gift.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane felt a little uncomfortable just recalling that sweet, beautiful smile. He tried to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        suppress the warmth creeping onto his face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sure, sure." Itsuki folded his arms and nodded knowingly. "I can tell from your reaction<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that it went over really well. She was definitely happy to get the gift, and she smiled at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you really cute-like, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean—" Amane bit his lip.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Look, man. You're building a solid connection, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Rather than teasing him, Itsuki was speaking earnestly and in a serious tone. Itsuki<p></p>
        <p></p>
        never intruded in certain areas that, as Amane's best friend, he knew better than to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        touch. But aside from those topics, he had an uncanny knack for pointing out the truth,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so much that it was sometimes uncomfortable. Amane had no recourse—Itsuki's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        relationship was too well established to make good conversation material at this<p></p>
        <p></p>
        point, so changing the subject was near impossible.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane choked on his words, and Itsuki smiled at him calmly. The somewhat warm<p></p>
        <p></p>
        look in his eyes irritated Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Seeing there was no use fighting back, Amane snatched a french fry and stubbornly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looked away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki smiled teasingly at his friend. "I'm happy for you, man. Finally, my little Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        is starting the springtime of his youth!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's not what's happening."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But you don't know for sure how she feels about it, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Even so, I'm sure it's not like that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Certainly, he knew from firsthand experience that Mahiru trusted him deeply. He<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wanted to be the person she trusted the most, in fact, and out of everyone she knew<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in school, he believed that she was the most honest with him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        But that didn't mean they were in love or anything.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Sure, sometimes when they touched, it felt a little… intense. But that wasn't uncommon<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with opposite-sex friendships. And okay, Mahiru did do a lot for him, but he was sure<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that didn't mean she had romantic feelings for him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        And yes, recently Amane had been spending a little more effort on his appearance. But<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he was still the same hopeless loser he'd always been. There was no way that a girl<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like Mahiru would fall for a guy like him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You know, Amane, you can be pretty pathetic sometimes. Seriously, you're the kind of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        guy who acts like nobody will ever love him."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You really think that all it takes for a guy like me to get an amazing girlfriend is a little<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hard work? I'd have better luck waiting on a miracle…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If all the beautiful girls were snapped up by only the most handsome, charming young<p></p>
        <p></p>
        men of the world, the guys who missed out might go down a violent path, you know."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wasn't sure Itsuki had a right to comment, as a member of the former group.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki continued, "Anyway, if you insist, we'll leave it at that for now… More importantly,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it's time for me to make a prediction as your best friend."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "About what?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sooner or later, you're gonna change. I can already see the telltale signs. All that's left<p></p>
        <p></p>
        is for you to take the first steps toward your new future."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Don't talk like some kind of know-it-all guru," Amane said with a scowl.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ha-ha-ha! How long have we been friends?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It hasn't even been a year," Amane quipped coolly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh yeah, that's right!" Itsuki roared with laughter.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The two of them had only known each other since the start of high school, but Itsuki<p></p>
        <p></p>
        understood Amane much better than the guys he'd known in elementary and middle<p></p>
        <p></p>
        school back home. He was glad that the two of them got along so easily.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Anyway—," Itsuki continued.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You keep going on and on about how you're not worthy of her, but your attitude and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the way you talk about her just proves that you actually do like her."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I will stick this french fry right up your nose," Amane threatened.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry," Itsuki instantly apologized.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane came very close to actually being impressed by what his friend had to say only<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for Itsuki to ruin it right at the end with a ridiculous comment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're late today."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Amane returned home about an hour later than usual, Mahiru came out to greet<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him in her apron. After his earlier conversation with Itsuki, Amane couldn't help but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        think that she looked like a newlywed. He told himself that he didn't feel that way<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about her, so it wasn't fair to indulge in that delusion, and he drove the thought from<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his mind in a bit of a panic.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm, I had fries with Itsuki."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Right before dinner?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't worry, I'll finish my plate."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had a second stomach for Mahiru's cooking, and he had been conservative and only<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had a small order of fries anyway, so he had plenty of room for his meal, even if Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dished up his usual serving size.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "For a second, I worried about you gaining weight…," Mahiru mused. "But you're so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slim that you could probably stand to put on a little bit more meat."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're one to talk. I'm always worried you might snap in half one day."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not that fragile, you know."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh really? Look at how thin you are."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had a very slender and feminine physique. Of course, she did quite a few<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sports, so she wasn't just thin, she was also toned and flexible. Still, she had a delicate<p></p>
        <p></p>
        look to her for some reason, and just as a test, he reached out and grabbed her wrist,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        easily wrapping his fingers all the way around. He remembered his father warning<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him to always treat a lady gently and with care.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She seemed so dainty and thin, he thought, as he moved his fingers along hers, feeling<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the delicate bones beneath her skin.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru squirmed uncomfortably. He saw she was staring at her hand in his, her cheeks<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slightly flushed, and realized much too late that he had been touching her without her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        permission.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In a panic, Amane released Mahiru's hand.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry. I should've known you wouldn't like that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's… Well… I don't hate it when you touch me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane stared at Mahiru in shock. He could barely believe his own ears. Mahiru also<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seemed to realize what exactly she had said and looked up suddenly, cheeks redder than<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he had ever seen them, eyes beginning to fill with tears. Amane felt like he couldn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        possibly bear the embarrassment a moment longer.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Th-that doesn't mean that I'm asking you to touch me or anything, all right?" Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        explained. "Just that I hate it when other guys touch me. You understand?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Y-yeah," Amane said meekly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        However, his heart was still pounding wildly. The very particular phrasing she had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        used left an awful lot open to interpretation. He felt like he needed to change the subject.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Oh, um, I noticed…," he mumbled, "you're not wearing the bracelet I gave you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        yesterday. I mean, obviously you don't have to wear it if you don't want…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru looked down at her wrist and with one finger softly traced the place where<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had grasped her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…If I wear it when I'm doing housework, it gets in the way, and it'll get damaged<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sooner… I want to keep it nice, so I'll wear it on my days off."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I see."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could not imagine a more perfect answer. She had told him both that she was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        going to treasure the gift and that she was intending to wear it regularly. His legs<p></p>
        <p></p>
        threatened to give out on the spot, and his chest felt like it might burst with all the<p></p>
