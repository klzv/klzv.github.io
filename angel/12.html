        Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru added in a small voice, "…There's just one thing."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. "Hmm?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…When we sit like this, I know I'm not alone, and I feel better," Mahiru mumbled. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sounded relieved.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I see," said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…The power's back on. I'm going to check my appliances."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's hold and stood up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears<p></p>
        <p></p>
        poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small "Thank you" and couldn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        help but stare at her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape. Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers<p></p>
        <p></p>
        there.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's weird," he muttered as he turned away bashfully<p></p>
        <p></p>
        16 Spending the End of the Year with the Angel<p></p>
        Once Christmas had passed, the whole world could feel the end of the year approaching.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The day after spending Christmas with Mahiru, Amane went out to do a bit of shopping<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on his own. By the time he was finished, his surroundings had undergone a dramatic<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shift, and Amane admired the new scenery on his way home.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The lights strung up around the city remained, but the ornamented trees and Christmas<p></p>
        <p></p>
        decorations had already been replaced with more traditional Japanese adornments.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The shops had also updated their merchandise, selling New Year's decorations and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        foods. If there were any Christmas things still in stock, at best they had been reduced<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in price and were displayed under INVENTORY CLEAR-OUT SALE labels.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane nestled his face deeper into the billowy folds of his scarf as he pondered the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sudden changeover. Mahiru had given him the monochrome houndstooth-patterned<p></p>
        <p></p>
        scarf as a Christmas present. It was both practical and tasteful; it looked stylish and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        felt very nice to the touch, and most importantly, it kept the chilly winter winds at bay.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had never really worn a scarf before, so he was feeling grateful for this one as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he checked over the contents of the shopping bags hanging from his arms.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Though the two of them were supposed to share this responsibility—in order to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        reduce the burden on Mahiru, who did all the cooking—Amane usually went out to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        buy the ingredients, armed with a shopping list.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was a cold day, and Amane's bags were stuffed with vegetables and mushrooms and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        meat—Mahiru must have been planning to make a hot pot. The plentiful vegetables<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were her way of wordlessly insisting that Amane eat a more balanced, nutritious diet.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He laughed quietly to himself, amused that Mahiru was somehow still looking out for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him even when she wasn't actually present.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He checked again to be sure that he'd gotten everything, then quickly returned home,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shivering against the relentless cold.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Welcome back."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was already evening when Amane entered his apartment, and Mahiru was there to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        greet him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was kind of a strange feeling, being welcomed into his own apartment, but recently<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he had gotten used to it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm, I'm back… I bought some thinly sliced mochi; I hope that's okay?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You want to cook it in the hot pot, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah. I also got some ramen to finish off the meal."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…There's no way I can eat that much, you know."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't worry, I'll make sure it doesn't go to waste."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had never been the type to eat huge meals before, but now, thanks to Mahiru's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cooking, he had started enjoying more sizable dinners. In fact, he found his new<p></p>
        <p></p>
        portion sizes a bit concerning and had resolved to start weight training.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to be watching her diet as well. She rarely prepared any fattening<p></p>
        <p></p>
        foods. On the other hand, she also seemed to think that Amane could stand to put on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a bit of weight, since he was so slim. Amane hoped he would add muscle and not fat.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, if you're going to finish it, then that's fine. Here, give me the bags. I'll put the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        things in the fridge. You go wash your hands."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I know, I know."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane handed the full shopping bags to Mahiru and obediently headed for the sink.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come to think of it, what are you doing for New Year's, Mahiru?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After finishing every last bite of the day's delicious meal, as always, Amane suddenly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        asked Mahiru the question that had been weighing on his mind.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "New Year's… Well, there's no point in going home, so I'll be here."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He realized his blunder when he heard her indifferent tone, but Mahiru didn't actually<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seem all that bothered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her relationship with her parents wasn't good, so she always had a cold attitude<p></p>
        <p></p>
        whenever the conversation turned to her family.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        But if that's the case, won't Mahiru be spending the holiday alone?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had his standing promise to show his face at home once every six months, so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he had been planning to visit during the long break—that was before he had met<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're going back home, right, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's right; I'm pretty much under orders to show up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He glanced over at her and saw that the expression in her eyes was somewhat chillier<p></p>
        <p></p>
        than usual. She seemed to have resolved herself to spending the holiday alone, what<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with Amane going away and all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Man, when I get home, I'm gonna get absolutely grilled about you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How terrible…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I can probably get by with just giving my dad the basics, but my mom is going to want<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to hear a whole lot more."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's awfully strange, since I talk to her all the time."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You really got familiar with my mom in no time…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        For some reason, Mahiru had made fast friends with Amane's mother and, without<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him noticing, had been sending her photos and private stories… which frankly killed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him a little inside. But Mahiru obviously enjoyed it, so Amane didn't see any harm in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it. He only hoped she wasn't telling his mother anything more than she absolutely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        needed to know.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Recalling the distant, lonely expression that crossed Mahiru's face from time to time,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane decided that he didn't want to leave her here alone.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I did just see Mom a little while ago… I would miss seeing Dad, but I wonder if<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it would be all right if I didn't go home for the New Year… Besides, I'm supposed to go<p></p>
        <p></p>
        back during spring vacation anyway."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was thinking that if he stayed here for the holiday, they could continue having<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dinner together like always… that is, if it wasn't too much of an imposition on Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Oh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm. Plus, I want to eat your New Year's noodles."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What a glutton you are."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's all because of your cooking."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Even when it's ready-made?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's right."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even if she only boiled the prepackaged soba noodles, Amane was sure he would still<p></p>
        <p></p>
        enjoy them. Because the important thing about their shared meals was the time they<p></p>
        <p></p>
        spent together.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You're an awfully strange person," Mahiru remarked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, hush."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He saw her smile slightly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Thank you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What for?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "For whatever."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru didn't say anything further, but her expression brightened somewhat, and she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        squeezed her favorite cushion.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        And then December 31 arrived. New Year's Eve was bringing the year to a close. For<p></p>
        <p></p>
        many, it was a busy day, spent cleaning and preparing for the year to come, but—<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Um, hey, Mahiru?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What is it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Are you sure you don't want me to help with anything?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        From his position sitting comfortably on the living room couch, Amane was gazing at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's back as she was standing apron-clad in his kitchen. She had been in there<p></p>
        <p></p>
        since that morning, making osechi, the traditional fare for the New Year holiday.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Since they had decided to ring in the New Year together, naturally they needed enough<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to feed two.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had assumed they would be purchasing it premade, but apparently Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        intended to make it all by hand. That would have been quite a task even for a skilled<p></p>
        <p></p>
        homemaker, so it was surprising for even this brilliant high school girl to tackle it all<p></p>
        <p></p>
        alone.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was seriously impressed, but Mahiru had said, "Well, there's no way we can get<p></p>
        <p></p>
        osechi from a store now. You have to order it well in advance."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Admittedly, she was absolutely right, but even so, Amane admired Mahiru for deciding<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to make everything herself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Of course, she took shortcuts where she could. For instance, boiling their own black<p></p>
        <p></p>
        soybeans would be very time-consuming and keep one burner occupied for far too<p></p>
        <p></p>
        long, so they had bought some prepared soybeans instead.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane, you seem uncomfortable whenever I say you don't have to do anything, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        do you have any idea how you might go about helping me?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Honestly, no clue."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I thought so. It's easier if you just stay out of the way."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane couldn't really argue with Mahiru's harsh assessment, so he tried to sit quietly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on the sofa, but he found it impossible to settle down and do nothing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It wasn't that Amane hadn't done anything at all—he'd finished cleaning his apartment<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the day before, and earlier he'd gone on a big shopping run, picking up ingredients for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the osechi dishes along with enough food so that they wouldn't have to go out for a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        while. He had taken care of the more physical tasks, but at the moment, Mahiru was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        busy, and he wasn't doing much.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You must be tired from moving all the furniture and appliances yesterday to clean, so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        please, just take it easy," Mahiru said without turning around, though Amane thought<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he heard a note of concern in her voice.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It appeared that Mahiru had already finished her own New Year's cleaning. Apparently,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it hadn't taken much work at all since she always kept her place so tidy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        So that's the difference between someone who makes a habit of keeping things clean and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        someone who doesn't, Amane mused. Guess I should've realized that earlier…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, even so, I feel bad about it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I really like cooking, so it's no trouble."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Still…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's fine; I'm having fun."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was at a loss for how to react to Mahiru, who brushed him off, fully absorbed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in her work.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru, I went ahead and bought lunch."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It would have been unfair to expect Mahiru to prepare lunch when she had her hands<p></p>
        <p></p>
        full with the osechi, so Amane had gone to the convenience store. He'd figured there<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would be no problem with a simple meal of sandwiches, since Mahiru didn't eat that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        much anyway.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had already taken off her apron. She must have been planning to take a break,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so the timing seemed just about perfect.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thanks for going to the trouble," Mahiru said as she stepped into the living room. Her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        break would double as lunchtime. "I'm really sorry for not getting around to making<p></p>
        <p></p>
        lunch."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come on, I'm definitely the one who should be apologizing, with you making all that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        osechi. Here, let's eat. How's a sandwich and cafe au lait sound?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's fine, thank you," Mahiru said as she accepted the food, then took a seat beside<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him on the couch.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So about how much have you gotten done so far?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I'm using a lot of premade ingredients, and I'm trying not to limit the number<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of dishes, so… I'd say I'm nearly finished. After this, there are a lot of things that need<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to rest or chill in the fridge. You seem to like sweet rolled omelets, Amane, so I made<p></p>
        <p></p>
        those by hand."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How did you know?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You like all the other egg dishes I make. I didn't think that rolled omelets would be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the exception."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He surmised that she had cooked them specially in the oven. He had heard it humming<p></p>
        <p></p>
        earlier and wondered what she was making.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You like the ones that are slightly sweet, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You know me too well."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's not surprising that I would learn your tastes after several months," Mahiru said<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as she bit into her ham and lettuce sandwich. It made him very happy to hear that.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Amane started eating the rice ball he had bought for himself, he looked over into<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the kitchen. His eyes landed on the smallish multitiered food boxes that Mahiru had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        brought over with her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She must be planning to pack the food into those boxes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He hadn't expected her to go so far as to bring out the special boxes for all the food—<p></p>
        <p></p>
        after all, she lived alone, just like him—so he had been a little shocked to see the fancy
        <p></p>
        looking containers all painted with lacquer and decorated with gold leaf.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Seriously, I can't thank you enough. How do I put this…? This past year, I've gotten to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        enjoy food in a way I never could have imagined when I first started living alone."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And here I thought you were doing just fine on your own."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Rude. You know better than anyone how I was surviving off convenience store meals."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It certainly wasn't healthy. That's for sure." Mahiru let out an exasperated sigh, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she also wore a knowing smile, which caught Amane by surprise. "Well, now that I'm<p></p>
        <p></p>
        here," she added, "I won't let you fall back into your old unhealthy habits, all right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Who are you, my mom?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's your own fault for living like that. Next year you're really going to learn how to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        eat properly. Do I make myself clear?" Mahiru's eyes shone with sudden enthusiasm.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane realized that she had just announced her intention to spend the coming year<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with him as well. The thought made him feel terribly self-conscious, and he found<p></p>
        <p></p>
        himself looking away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        However, Mahiru must have interpreted that gesture as a reluctance to give up his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slothful ways because she promptly scowled at Amane, who found himself struggling<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to awkwardly explain himself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru finished making and packing up all the osechi dishes by around sunset and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        then set about preparing the New Year's noodles, which just entailed boiling the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        noodles and readying the toppings, since they had bought precut raw noodles.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She had some kamaboko fish cake left over from the osechi, so that was a perfect<p></p>
        <p></p>
        addition. All there was left to do was parboil the spinach and slice the green onion.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The most labor-intensive part was the shrimp tempura, but Mahiru seemed to be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        having no trouble as she fried them all up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I also had some kabocha left over, so I'm going to fry that while I'm at it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Man… these are gonna be some serious New Year's noodles."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sometimes it's fun to make stuff like this," Mahiru said as she finished serving up the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        noodles. They looked far more splendid than anything most people would normally<p></p>
        <p></p>
        eat at home.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She had made two large pieces of shrimp tempura per bowl, and the bonus kabocha<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tempura was crisped to perfection. There was plenty of spinach and green onion, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the kamaboko fish cake was cut into a decorative fan shape.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane noticed that Mahiru liked to keep her tempura crispy, as both of their portions<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had been placed on separate plates rather than directly in the bowl with the noodles.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was grateful for this small, thoughtful act.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Wow!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Please, eat up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Perhaps concerned that the noodles wouldn't be enough to satisfy Amane's appetite,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had also served all the leftover bits from the osechi dishes on a small plate.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane watched Mahiru take her seat, then they both pressed their hands together to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        give thanks for the food before digging into their noodles.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even though Mahiru had said that the soba had come premade, she must have picked<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out high-quality noodles. Amane could smell the rich fragrance of buckwheat with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        every bite. The broth wasn't too thick or too thin, and it was seasoned so well he sighed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with delight. It warmed him from the depths of his belly. The perfect dish for a cold<p></p>
        <p></p>
        day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah… now this is what the end of the year should feel like…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He took a sip of broth and sighed… mumbling quietly to himself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was certainly enjoying the chance to sit back and watch TV while eating his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        noodles, awaiting the arrival of the New Year.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was also his family's custom every year to eat New Year's noodles and spend New<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Year's Eve watching the year-end musical specials on television, so Amane was glad<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that he could keep the tradition going.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        But tonight he was not sitting with his family—instead, there was a beautiful girl<p></p>
        <p></p>
        beside him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "When you eat New Year's noodles, it hits you all at once that the year's really ending,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        doesn't it?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I know what you mean…," Amane replied. "So much happened this year."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Of course, he was mostly talking about his burgeoning relationship with Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When he'd first started living alone, he couldn't possibly have imagined such a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        beautiful girl fixing him such delicious meals.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, because this was the year you started living alone, right, Amane? That must have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been difficult."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You, on the other hand, never seem to have any trouble, do you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, that's because I can more or less do everything for myself. It's a disaster for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        someone like you, trying to live on your own even though you don't know how to do<p></p>
        <p></p>
        anything."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh… that's true, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You really are the definition of hopeless, aren't you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The expression on Mahiru's face was gentle as she scolded him, more charming than<p></p>
        <p></p>
        exasperated. She didn't seem burdened by taking care of Amane. She just looked…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        content.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I owe you for everything you've done this year."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He repeated the words of thanks that he had said to her on Christmas, and Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smiled slightly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And don't you ever forget it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her quick and unconditional agreement prickled slightly in his chest, but his saving<p></p>
        <p></p>
        grace was that Mahiru clearly didn't mean anything.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I hope you'll help me out next year, too."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I know I'll need to. If I wasn't around, you'd barrel headlong into an unhealthy and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slovenly lifestyle again in no time."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I can't deny that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…If you're aware of it, then you ought to do better…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'll aspire to do so in the coming year."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even if he did put his mind to it, Amane had a feeling that Mahiru's constant caretaking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would quickly erode any desire to fend for himself. Of course, he couldn't say that out<p></p>
        <p></p>
        loud, so he pushed the thought to the back of his mind.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He'd do his best to keep his place tidy, but there was no doubt that he would still be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        depending on her for meals. He had become entirely domesticated, and the fact that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he was painfully aware of this development didn't make it any less true. Plus, Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        always laughed at him whenever he said he was going to try to improve himself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane made a sour face, but Mahiru just smiled slightly, as if she was savoring the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        moment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "The New Year's almost upon us."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Looks like it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They had finished eating their New Year's noodles and sat on the sofa watching the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        annual end-of-the-year musical showcase on television. Before either of them realized<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it, the new day—and the New Year—was just moments away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Time had passed much faster than Amane had expected while he was occupied<p></p>
        <p></p>
        watching Mahiru quietly enjoy the show. Apparently, she wasn't very familiar with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        current pop music, possibly because she didn't watch much TV in general.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The screen switched over to a scene of a temple bell—a clear sign the year was about<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to end. The great bell began ringing. Seated next to him, Mahiru quietly listened to the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chimes, eyes lowered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As the bell rang the one hundred and seventh time—<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The instant that the new day began, Mahiru turned to him, sat up properly, and bowed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Happy New Year," she said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Caught up in the moment, Amane also straightened up and gave her the same formal<p></p>
        <p></p>
        New Year's greeting. "Happy New Year… It feels kind of strange, huh? Spending it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        together."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Heh-heh, I suppose it does," Mahiru replied. "I hope you'll look after me this year as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        well."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Of course… Though, it feels like I should really be the one asking you that, eh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I can't argue with that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru let out a giggle, and Amane shot her a slightly awkward grin. Then the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smartphone he had on his lap began to vibrate. His messaging app had several<p></p>
        <p></p>
        notifications—New Year's greetings had come in from Itsuki and Chitose.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's phone also vibrated. She had only just met his friends and hadn't exchanged<p></p>
        <p></p>
        contact info with Chitose yet, so she must have been getting messages from a friend<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane didn't know.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In recent years, the convenience of sending New Year's greetings via phone message<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had become really popular.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm just going to reply to this."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Same."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane figured that Mahiru had probably received a lot of messages. Yet somehow he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        also had the feeling that she wasn't in the habit of giving boys her contact information.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane watched Mahiru's practiced fingers flit deftly across her phone as she typed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out her responses. "It's times like these that you finally seem like a regular high school<p></p>
        <p></p>
        girl," he remarked before checking his own phone.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The messages from Itsuki and Chitose were the bog-standard 'Happy New Year'<p></p>
        <p></p>
        followed by needless prying. "Did you spend the New Year holiday getting friendly with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Lady Shiina?" As usual, Itsuki was disconcertingly perceptive.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane sent a reply denying it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Immediately, he got a mocking response from Itsuki, accusing him of lying. For a while,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the two friends carried on a lively text conversation. Itsuki would make certain<p></p>
        <p></p>
        allegations that Amane would deny every time, and then… he felt a weight flop down<p></p>
        <p></p>
        against his upper arm.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A sweet fragrance wafted over him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The sudden contact startled him. He glanced timidly to the side, not believing it could<p></p>
        <p></p>
        be true… only to confirm that Mahiru was indeed leaning against him, fast asleep.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        —Wait, wait, wait!<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane didn't say anything out loud, but he was already beginning to panic on the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        inside.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had dozed off at his place before, but who could have ever imagined that she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would do so here and now, right beside him, pressed up against his shoulder?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was obvious what had happened.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They had stayed up quite late, past twelve thirty AM. Mahiru, who observed a strict<p></p>
        <p></p>
        routine, probably wasn't used to being awake at this hour. Moreover, she had spent<p></p>
        <p></p>
        most of the day bustling about making the osechi dishes and must have been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        exhausted, even if she didn't show it on the surface. She simply hadn't had the strength<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to fight off the sandman any longer.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane completely understood—but to fall asleep now of all times!<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Dozing against Amane's shoulder, Mahiru wore a truly peaceful expression, completely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        oblivious to his confusion and consternation. Her long eyelashes and cute nose and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pink lips all had a soft vulnerability to them that Amane hadn't noticed before.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It wasn't the first time he'd seen her sleeping face, but he had never observed her from<p></p>
        <p></p>
        such close range, and the sight froze him in place.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru…," he said hesitantly. "Mahiru, wake up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was no response.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru must have been incredibly tired. It seemed that her fatigue had dragged her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        down into the deepest oceans of slumber. He called out to her and nudged her with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his shoulder, but the girl showed no sign of waking.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even when he tapped her shoulder and gently shook her body, Mahiru didn't stir.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His attempts to rouse her caused her to start pitching forward after slipping off his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        arm. In a panic, Amane caught her and pulled her back toward him… which was fine,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but now he found himself embracing her. His alarm only grew.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …Wow, she smells amazing…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After dinner, Mahiru had briefly gone back to her place to freshen up, and the floral<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fragrance of her shampoo that mingled with her natural scent was making Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tremendously uncomfortable. And he couldn't help but notice how soft she was,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pressed up against him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was not handling this well.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had tried to wake her, but she had fallen too deeply asleep, and he was reluctant to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        try to rouse her more forcefully.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        What should I do?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The New Year had barely started, and Amane was already facing an unbelievable<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dilemma.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He looked down at the girl sleeping in his arms with grim determination. She was still<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out cold. She must really trust me to drift off like that without a care, Amane realized. It<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was enough to make him want to bang his head against the wall in frustration and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        embarrassment as his sense of reason began to fail him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        No matter how he tried, his attention kept straying back to the distinct feeling of her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slender body pressed against his. It was firm, but with a feminine softness to it, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had a particularly intoxicating voluptuousness where their chests met…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        —What the heck should I do?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Not only was Amane utterly unprepared for his present situation, the unimaginable<p></p>
        <p></p>
        softness brushing against him was quickly wearing away at any remaining composure<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he thought he possessed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        This was the first time he had ever realized how soft and supple and nice-smelling<p></p>
        <p></p>
        girls could be… and even thinking about how he felt was enough to send his mind<p></p>
        <p></p>
        spinning into chaos. It was like one big feedback loop.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even so, he still felt compelled to do something. He had a feeling that there was not<p></p>
        <p></p>
        going to be an easy way out of this one, so Amane tried to clear his mind and steel his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        resolve.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At the moment, there were three ways he could think of to approach this.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        1. Wake Mahiru forcefully.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        2. Carry Mahiru home.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        3. Let Mahiru sleep in his own bed—and spend the night on the couch himself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The first option gave him pause. He didn't like the idea of jostling Mahiru awake when<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she was obviously so very tired. What's more, he was the one responsible for wearing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her out, so if it was possible, he wanted to let her rest.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At first glance, option two initially seemed like it would be the least awkward, but he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was really uncomfortable with the idea of searching through Mahiru's pockets for the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        key to her apartment and entering a girl's home without permission. He also suspected<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that Mahiru would not be too pleased to discover that he'd decided that on his own.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Option three, letting her stay over, was seemed like a safer choice that would be easy<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to pull off, but… he was not at all emotionally prepared to have a beautiful girl sleeping<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in his bed. It didn't matter how they normally got along. Amane felt like the innocent<p></p>
        <p></p>
        charm of her sleeping face was driving him mad.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The thought of such a stunning beauty asleep on his pillow was almost unbearable for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        this growing boy. Some of the images that crossed his mind were guilt-inducing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Still, there was no denying it was the most promising option and the most considerate<p></p>
        <p></p>
        compromise that Amane could think of.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He steadied himself for the task, then gently wrapped his hands around Mahiru's back<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and under her knees and slowly lifted her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She was sleeping soundly and was as light as a feather. Of course he would never say<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so out loud, but Mahiru felt almost ephemeral in his arms.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had learned firsthand that she probably wouldn't wake up too easily, but just in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        case, Amane tried to keep her as steady as possible while he gingerly carried her to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his room. It took both hands to cradle her, so opening the door proved quite the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        challenge, but eventually Amane successfully laid Mahiru on his bed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her delicate body sunk into the mattress.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Once Amane had covered her with a blanket and comforter, she was all set up for the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        night. He didn't see any indication she was going to wake up, and all he could hear was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her regular, rhythmic breathing. Her face was beautiful as always, but seeing it so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cherubic in sleep was making Amane's heart jump in his chest.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He courteously tucked her in, then crouched down beside the bed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …It's too much.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Having a girl sleeping in his bed, remembering the soft feeling of her body against his,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seeing her adorable and defenseless sleeping face, then realizing just how much she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        must trust him to fall asleep in his apartment—that and a million other things were<p></p>
        <p></p>
        running through his mind.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Of course, he was grateful she believed in him, but at the same time, he couldn't help<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but think that she only saw him as a safe and hopeless nuisance, a harmless little boy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane glanced over at her and noted the tranquil expression on her sleeping face. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was utterly oblivious to his inner turmoil.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She has no idea how I feel.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        And she's let down her guard too much.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …I could climb into that bed right now if I wanted to…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The thought lasted only a moment before he pushed it out of his mind. Of course it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would be wrong, on so many levels. And he knew that the moment Mahiru woke up<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and discovered them sleeping together, she would never talk to him ever again. He<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shuddered at the thought of her soft eyes turning cold and scornful.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That is definitely a bad idea.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        But maybe, instead of that, if… just a little... would be okay, wouldn't it?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He extended a hand toward Mahiru's head.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Smooth, sleek, glossy—those were the words that came to mind as he slid his fingers<p></p>
        <p></p>
        over her long, soft, vibrant hair without hitting a single snag.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She must work hard to keep it like this, huh…?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Feeling both admiration and a shudder of fear at the enormous efforts demanded by<p></p>
        <p></p>
        femininity, Amane let his fingertips glide slowly across Mahiru's cheek. Her porcelain<p></p>
        <p></p>
        skin was surprisingly cool, at least compared to Amane's fingers. When the brief<p></p>
        <p></p>
        caress was over, Amane looked down and saw that a slight smile had graced Mahiru's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tranquil face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Good night."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I'm sure she'll be surprised when she wakes up in the morning tomorrow… or actually<p></p>
        <p></p>
        today, I guess. Considering what he had just gone through, he figured that she could<p></p>
        <p></p>
        live with a little surprise.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I really am hopeless…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane flashed a troubled smile, then gently reached out to stroke Mahiru's soft cheek<p></p>
        <p></p>
        one more time.<p></p>
        <p></p>

        17 The Defenseless Angel and the Start of the New Year<p></p>
        When Amane awoke in the morning, all was quiet.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He could hear the cries of birds outside, but there was no sign from his bedroom that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was up yet.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was already past dawn, but maybe because she was exhausted from the night before,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to still be sleeping soundly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had only managed to get some brief shut-eye—the persistent thought of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru in his bed made true rest elusive—and he had ended up drifting off, lingering<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on the edge of sleep until deciding to get up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The restless night wasn't particularly taxing on him physically, so that was fine, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the whole situation was trying in another way. This was the first time he had ever let<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a girl stay over at his place, never mind having one sleep in his bed. Naturally, he was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        incredibly anxious.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …I mean, what am I even supposed to do in a situation like this?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was pretty sure that Mahiru had only allowed herself to fall asleep because she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        considered him a safe and harmless guy, but Amane was a guy nonetheless, a fact that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he wished she would acknowledge more often.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He really regretted not waking her and sending her back home, but it was no use now.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane sighed and stretched to work out the knots in his body after spending the night<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on the sofa, then stood up slowly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        For the time being, he thought he would look in on Mahiru. Well, his main goal was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        actually to grab a change of clothes, but he decided to check on her while he was in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        there.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Ever so slowly, he opened the bedroom door.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Inside, it was quiet. Mahiru was just as he had left her, still sleeping in his bed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If there had been any change, it was that she must have turned over several times in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her sleep, because now she was lying on her side, and her hair was spread across the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sheets like a flowing river of gold.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane knelt down to look at Mahiru more closely. Her sleeping breaths were even and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        serene.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She looks so innocent when she's asleep.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru often wore a calm expression, perhaps because she usually had her guard up,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but… her sleeping face was the picture of tranquility. Again, he felt the urge to reach<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out and pet her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …She really is cute like this…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Of course, she was undeniably beautiful any time of day, but seeing her in such a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        vulnerable state plucked at Amane's heartstrings in a very different way.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He wanted to stroke her smooth hair and poke at her soft cheeks.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She was usually so proper and reserved, with no gaps or cracks in her facade, so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        catching her in a defenseless state like this made him want to mess with her a little.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Without putting any thought into the matter, Amane stretched a hand out toward her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and pressed the tip of his finger against her cheek, which looked so soft. Mahiru's skin<p></p>
