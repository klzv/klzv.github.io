        "Amane, your sniffling's annoying."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chapter 2
        "You're annoying."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The next day, it was Amane who'd ended up with the cold.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As his classmate and good friend Itsuki Akazawa had pointed out, Amane had been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        trying and failing to snort everything back up his nose. Trying to exhale only resulted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in a terrible, wet, burbling sound.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wasn't sure whether it was because his nose was stuffed up or as a result of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the cold itself, but a throbbing pain was spreading across the back of his head. He had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        taken some over-the-counter medicine, but it wasn't making a dent in his symptoms<p></p>
        <p></p>
        at all. Truly, Amane was a sad sight. His congested face twisted in nasal distress as he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        became well acquainted with a tissue.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki looked at him, not with concern but exasperation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You were just fine yesterday, dude."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I got caught in the rain."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Aw, chin up. Wait, didn't you have an umbrella yesterday?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I gave it to someone."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Naturally, there was no way that Amane could openly admit at school that he'd given<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it to Mahiru, so he kept things vague.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Incidentally, he'd caught a glimpse of Mahiru earlier that day. She'd looked rather well,<p></p>
        not ill at all. Amane couldn't help but laugh. Things had gotten completely flipped around.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was his own fault—he'd neglected to warm up in the bath when he'd gotten home.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don'cha think you were being a little too nice, lending out your umbrella when it was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pouring like that?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Not really. Even if I did, no point complaining about it now."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And who did you give it to anyway? Who was worth catching a cold?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…A, uh, a lost little kid?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Can't really call her a kid with that body, though… Well, that and the fact that we're the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        same age. Although, her face did look kinda lost…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Something clicked when Amane thought of the unusual encounter that way. Her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expression had been exactly that of a lost little kid searching for their parent.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, what a kind and upstanding gentleman you are!" Itsuki laughed, unaware of the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        feelings bubbling up in Amane's chest as he recalled his meeting with Mahiru the day<p></p>
        <p></p>
        before. "But you know, even if you let someone borrow your umbrella or whatever, I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bet your real problem was that you got lazy and didn't warm up afterward. That's why<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you're dying."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…How do you know that?" Amane shot back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, you don't exactly take good care of yourself. That much was obvious the moment<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I saw your place. That's why you got sick, dumbass."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane couldn't really argue with Itsuki's friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and his room was always a total mess. What's more, he subsisted on a diet of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent<p></p>
        <p></p>
        meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with him, asking him how he could live like that.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        caught a cold overnight.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow's Saturday, so focus on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        getting better," Itsuki advised.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I will…," Amane replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do." Itsuki's lips curled up<p></p>
        <p></p>
        at his slight boast.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shut up. I don't need to hear that from a guy who's already got a girlfriend." Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        irritated.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As the day wore on, Amane's condition continued to deteriorate.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        rougher than usual, and he felt hot.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he'd let his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally<p></p>
        <p></p>
        not a concern, was now a source of dull agony.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane's floor, he staggered out on leaden<p></p>
        <p></p>
        feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        complexion vibrant and glowing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day<p></p>
        <p></p>
        before, neatly folded and closed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn't have to, Amane reasoned.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Really, you don't need to give it back," he said aloud.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's only natural to return something you borrowed…" Mahiru hesitated as soon as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she got a good look at Amane's face. "Um. You have a fever, don't you…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…It's got nothing to do with you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru—and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn't have been worth<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out how Amane had caught a cold.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in the rain."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I said it's fine, really. It's not something you need to worry about."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        From Amane's perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self-satisfaction, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he didn't want her fussing over him now.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        However, Mahiru didn't seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her graceful features.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…So yeah, it's all good. See ya." Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru's questioning and concern.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength<p></p>
        <p></p>
        left his body.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wouldn't break, and he wouldn't fall. Surely it would catch him, and he'd be fine.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there's no avoiding it…, Amane thought,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        resigning himself to the pain.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Just as I thought; I can't leave you alone like this." Amane heard a fragile voice through<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his feverish haze. "I'll repay your favor."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        opened the door to his apartment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm going to help you inside. There's no other way, so please forgive the intrusion."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        didn't have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        descended to care for him instead.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        place until it was too late. It wasn't until he saw the condition his home was in that he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        regretted ever letting Mahiru enter.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        main living space.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane's parents<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wasn't about to complain.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were<p></p>
        <p></p>
        not kept especially tidy. Various items were scattered all over the living room, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "This is too pitiful to look at." The angel, Amane's savior, gave him a frank assessment<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming<p></p>
        <p></p>
        appearance.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he'd known that he'd be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied<p></p>
        <p></p>
        up a bit, but it was too late for that now.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        serious cleaning sometime soon.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "First, I'm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get<p></p>
        <p></p>
        back. You can do that, right?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You're coming back?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt<p></p>
        <p></p>
        toward her when she was soaking wet the day before.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was told and started changing out of his school uniform.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's really a mess in here; there's nowhere to even step… How can anyone live like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        this…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next<p></p>
        <p></p>
        room, and felt quite ashamed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without<p></p>
        <p></p>
        realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the first thing he saw.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…What time is it?" Amane asked, confused.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Seven in the evening," Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. "You slept for several hours."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        able to take a look at his surroundings.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn't have any of those at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his place, and he looked up at Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I brought it from home," she answered immediately.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks, either. Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        must have brought that over as well.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's fine."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru's curt answer.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn't mean<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        already talking with a boy she barely knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only<p></p>
        <p></p>
        natural.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It's better<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to take it with something in your stomach… Are you hungry at all?" Mahiru asked gently.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm, a little bit," Amane answered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you're welcome to have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Huh, you made it yourself?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is there anyone else here but me? If you don't want it, I'll eat it all alone."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, I'll eat it! Please let me eat it!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he was caught off guard.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he'd never heard<p></p>
        <p></p>
        rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn't be awful.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane's sudden bow and insistence that he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on the side table.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'll bring it to you, so take your temperature first."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Okay," Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Do it after I leave the room, please." There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        spied that the girl's pale cheeks were tinged red.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane hadn't thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn't consider<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        accustomed to seeing much skin.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned<p></p>
        <p></p>
        away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shyness almost palpable.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he'd also never had any<p></p>
        <p></p>
        special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her like one would a distant masterpiece.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru wasn't some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        idol, and it was strangely adorable.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The two didn't have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird<p></p>
        <p></p>
        if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?" he asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Y-you don't have to tell me," Mahiru answered dismissively. "I'll be right back." She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe<p></p>
        <p></p>
        because of all the clutter. Probably the latter.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out<p></p>
        <p></p>
        this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dangerous; she could be attacked or something.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must've meant she was worried about him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        obligation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Then came a hesitant knock at the door.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I've brought the porridge."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At the sound of Mahiru's concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered<p></p>
        <p></p>
        again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I haven't taken my temperature yet," he called back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry, I spaced out."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few<p></p>
        <p></p>
        moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn't bad<p></p>
        <p></p>
        enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Okay, I'm finished," Amane said as he put his shirt back on.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What was your temperature?" she asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thirty-eight point three. I'll be better after I take some medicine and get some more<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sleep."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won't eliminate the virus<p></p>
        <p></p>
        itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then<p></p>
        <p></p>
        opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        done that intentionally because she'd thought it'd be easier on Amane's stomach.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She'd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        colds.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The dish wasn't steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hadn't brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool<p></p>
        <p></p>
        down first.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the rice mixed easily.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Here you go. It shouldn't be too hot."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm, thank you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru gave Amane a puzzled look as he received the bowl, but then he merely stared<p></p>
        <p></p>
        at the porridge while his spoon hovered over it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…What is it; you want me to feed you? Sorry, but that's not on the menu," Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        asserted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nobody asked for that, okay? It's just… So I guess you can cook, too, huh?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I live alone, so of course I can." The girl's words stung, a heavy reminder of Amane's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        own domestic failures. "But before you learn to cook, you should learn to clean up your<p></p>
        <p></p>
        room, Fujimiya."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yes, ma'am…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had quickly and thoroughly put him in his place. Amane grumbled quietly and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        scooped up some of the porridge, stuffing the spoon into his mouth in a bid to end the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        conversation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The flavor of the lightly salted rice spread across his tongue as he ate the porridge.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The mellow sourness of the pickled plums pulled it all together. It was truly a dish with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a perfect balance of flavors.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane didn't like pickled plums that were too salty, but these had a milder taste and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a bit of sweetness. They were actually a favorite of his. Often, he liked to top green tea<p></p>
        <p></p>
        rice with pickled plums.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's good."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thanks for saying so. Though, really, once you've tasted one rice porridge, I think<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you've probably tasted them all." Mahiru's answer appeared indifferent, save for the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        very slightest beginnings of a smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Without meaning to, Amane found himself staring at the beautiful girl's relieved<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expression. Something about it seemed quite different from the more outgoing smile<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he occasionally caught her wearing at school.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Fujimiya?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry, it's nothing," he answered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane thought it a shame that such a beautiful smile had been so fleeting, though he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        kept the musing to himself. Instead, he shoveled spoonful after spoonful of porridge<p></p>
        <p></p>
        into his mouth.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Anyhow, you rest today. And make sure to replenish your fluids. If you need to wipe<p></p>
        <p></p>
        away sweat, use this. I've put water into your washbowl, so make sure to wet it and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wring it out before wiping, okay?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After Amane had eaten, Mahiru diligently prepared an unopened sports drink, readied<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the bowl of water, and laid out a towel and spare cooling sheets. All had been carefully<p></p>
        <p></p>
        placed on the side table in Amane's bedroom.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was no way Mahiru was going to stay over at the home of a boy she barely knew.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wouldn't have stood for it if she'd tried. Thus, Mahiru had prepared everything<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could've needed while he rested, and he was grateful for her diligence, though<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he stared at her the whole time she got everything ready.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        This is an awful lot just to repay a favor. Once this is over, I guess we won't have much<p></p>
        <p></p>
        reason to interact. It's a one-off thing, a freak occurrence; that's all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Well, since we won't be talking ever again, I guess it's all right to ask about that thing I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        want to know.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Whether from the medicine or his nap, Amane's head felt clearer, though he was still<p></p>
        <p></p>
        exhausted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, there's something I've been wondering…," he started.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What is it?" Mahiru turned to look at him from where she was setting up all the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        essentials he'd need.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Why were you sitting out in the rain? Did you have a fight with your boyfriend or<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something?" The strange behavior that'd kicked off this whole chain of events had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been on Amane's mind since he'd first noticed it. Mahiru had been rocking back and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        forth on a swing in the pouring rain. What could she have been doing there?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was precisely because Amane had been curious about Mahiru's slight resemblance<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to a lost child that he'd offered her his umbrella in the first place. He'd never<p></p>
        <p></p>
        discovered why she'd been out there in the storm to begin with, however.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had thought Mahiru had been waiting for someone, so he'd guessed that there<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was a boy she was dating, even wondering if perhaps she and her boyfriend had gotten<p></p>
        <p></p>
        into an argument. In response to Amane's question, Mahiru looked at him as if she was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fed up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry, but I don't have a boyfriend, and I have no plans to get one," she replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh? Why?" Amane asked almost unconsciously.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Let me ask you, why did you assume I was dating someone?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "With how popular you are, I thought you'd have at least one or two boyfriends."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Something about this back-and-forth made Mahiru seem much more like a normal girl<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to Amane. She was kind but strong-willed. To other people, though, he was sure she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seemed quite different. Mahiru was a beautiful girl who was tidy, sweet, quiet, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        humble. Her pretty face, so lovely that she was often called an angel, turned heads<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wherever she went, and her body was petite but possessed abundant curves. The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        briefest sight of her instilled a strange, momentary feeling of wanting to protect her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That quality, combined with her excellent sense of style, made her an object of desire<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for many a schoolboy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        On top of all that, her grades kept her at the top of her class, and she was an all-around<p></p>
        <p></p>
        excellent athlete. What's more, Amane had just learned firsthand that she was good at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cooking, too. That certainly wouldn't hurt her popularity.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Just one glance was enough to know there must have been plenty of guys who were<p></p>
        <p></p>
        after her, and Amane knew for a fact that quite a few of his own classmates had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        romantic feelings for Mahiru. She could've had her pick of the litter, and it hadn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        occurred to him that she might not be seeing anyone.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That was what Amane had meant when he'd said that thing about one or two<p></p>
        <p></p>
        boyfriends, but the moment she'd heard those words, Mahiru's expression had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stiffened, if only for a moment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't have a boyfriend, and what's more, I'm not the kind of girl who would keep the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        company of several boys at once. It's absolutely out of the question."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's eyes were so cold, they sent a shiver down Amane's spine. He realized<p></p>
        <p></p>
        immediately that he'd stepped on some kind of social land mine.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It might have been because of his sickness, but he felt a chill pass over him, and the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        room seemed drafty all of a sudden.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry, that's not what I meant. I apologize," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…No, I'm sorry for getting fired up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru bowing her head seemed to disperse the cold, tense atmosphere of the room.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        More than being "fired up," Mahiru's icy reply to Amane's question had been like a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        blizzard, though he knew better than to point that out.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Anyway, that's not what was going on at all. I was just trying to cool my head a bit…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        And I really am sorry that you caught a cold because you were worried about me,"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's fine. I mean, it was my decision, after all. I feel kind of guilty about all this, actually.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I only gave you the umbrella as a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing. I'll try not to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bother you once this is all over."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was sure that Mahiru was only there to help out of some sense of obligation,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but when she heard what he had to say, she blinked a few times and gave him a curious<p></p>
        <p></p>
        look. It must have intrigued her to hear that he wouldn't be troubling her again.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "We don't really have any reason to interact, so it's not like it'll be a big deal. I mean,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        even if you're the most beautiful girl in our grade, and a genius, and everyone calls you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        an angel, I wasn't trying to hook up with you; I swear. You don't think that this was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some kind of scheme or something, do you?" Amane inquired.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru looked away a little awkwardly. A bitter smile spread across her lips, as if she'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been waiting for Amane to say those exact words. Finally, he realized that she wasn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        just acting cagey. Mahiru had probably wound up in that sort of situation a few times<p></p>
        <p></p>
        before. A guy trying to get in with a beautiful girl by making her feel indebted was,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        unfortunately, not unheard of.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It explained why Mahiru had been so wary of Amane that day in the rain. She hadn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been upset at him; she'd just been trying to protect herself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It must be so irritating. Being bothered by guys you don't even like," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, that's true, but…" Mahiru's voice trailed off.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Called it," quipped Amane, a little surprised to hear her admit it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        So the quiet, charming, model student, the one everybody makes a big fuss over, the one<p></p>
        <p></p>
        everybody calls an angel, does have things she doesn't like. Why, she even gets annoyed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        from time to time, just like the rest of us mortals. The thought gave Amane the sudden<p></p>
        <p></p>
        impression that he was seeing the real Mahiru for the first time.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Unfortunately, the way she glared back at Amane seemed to suggest that she was really<p></p>
        <p></p>
        regretting having ever met him. It looked like she resented him for making her reveal<p></p>
        <p></p>
        how she really felt.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Further proof that the angelic honor student has real emotions hidden deep down,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane thought.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't really see the problem with that," admitted Amane. "Actually, I'm relieved. It's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nice to hear that the angel finds that stuff just as annoying as normal humans."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Please stop calling me that." Mahiru obviously hated the title others had given her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With disapproval in her eyes, she continued to gaze at Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even her displeasure seemed interesting to Amane, who smiled again and said, "Not<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to worry, I won't bother you again without a good reason."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's eyes opened wide as if his declaration had caught her by surprise. With the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        faintest whisper of a smile crossing her lips, she bowed sharply and left.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane lay in bed, staring vacantly up at the ceiling while thinking about Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even though the medicine had taken effect, he was, unsurprisingly, still feeling sluggish.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If he relaxed, sleep would surely claim him in no time at all. He closed his eyes and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        reflected on the events of the day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        No one would ever believe him if he told them that he'd been nursed back to health by<p></p>
        <p></p>
        an angel with a surprisingly sharp tongue. The day's events were a secret shared only<p></p>
        <p></p>
        by Amane and Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It feels kinda weird to call it a secret. It's more like it'd be a real pain to explain the whole<p></p>
        <p></p>
        story. It's just easier not to tell anybody, that's all, Amane reasoned.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As he slowly lost consciousness, Amane told himself that, when tomorrow came, he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and Mahiru would be nothing more than mere acquaintances again.<p></p>
        <p></p>

        3 The Angel’s Generosity<p></p>
        As Amane had anticipated, he and Mahiru had returned to being nothing more than<p></p>
        <p></p>
        two people who attended the same school.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He'd been feeling much better the following day and had happened to run into Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        when he went out to shop at the convenience store, but they hadn't said very much to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        each other. Amane did catch that Mahiru looked a little relieved to see him well on his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        way to recovery.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Nothing changed back at school on the following Monday, either. The two were back<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to being strangers. The only tiny difference was that now, whenever they encountered<p></p>
        <p></p>
        each other on the way to school, she would greet him with a quick bow. That was all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, Amane, you feeling better?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm good, thanks."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It seemed that Itsuki had also been worried about Amane. He'd been in rather bad<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shape last Friday, after all. Amane's condition had been the first thing Itsuki asked<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about when they saw each other outside the school building. Itsuki had even sent<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane a text over the weekend: "You're not dead, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had sent back a message that he was fine, but it seemed Itsuki had only been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        half-convinced, because he let out a deep sigh of relief when he saw in person how<p></p>
        <p></p>
        much better his friend was feeling.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, well, when I saw you in such bad shape, even I started to worry, man! It's all<p></p>
        <p></p>
        good if you're better now. You oughtta take better care of yourself. Start by cleaning<p></p>
        <p></p>
        your room or somethin'."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You sound like somebody else I know," Amane quipped.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nothing. Something happened this weekend that kind of opened my eyes. I'll clean<p></p>
        <p></p>
        my place up in a few days."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki didn't let up. "Nah, man, you gotta sort yourself out now!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane turned away in a huff. It would probably take more than half a day to clean that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mess up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Looking exasperated, Itsuki backed off a bit, saying, "I mean, you can live however you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        want, ya know. But just clear a path you can actually walk through for the next time I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        come over."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'll deal with it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Wearing a sour face the whole time, Amane changed into his indoor shoes and headed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for his classroom. An extremely boisterous room caught his attention as he walked<p></p>
        <p></p>
        down a hall, however, and he couldn't help but peek in.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Glancing in through a hallway window, Amane saw Mahiru, as beautiful as she'd ever<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been, surrounded by her classmates.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Whenever someone spoke to her, she would turn to them with a quiet smile. Everything<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about her persona seemed totally different from the Mahiru he'd seen the other day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane suddenly broke out in a smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Noticing his friend's gaze, Itsuki's eyes followed the same path. He saw Mahiru and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        immediately understood.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shiina, huh? As popular as always. No surprise, given how pretty she is."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, you know what they say. She's an angel. What about you, Itsuki? Think she's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cute?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, I guess so. But I've got Chi, so only in a sorta aesthetic-appreciation-type way,"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Quit going on about your girlfriend already."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki had a girlfriend named Chi, although that was a nickname. Her full name was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose Shirakawa.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They were an extremely close couple, madly in love with each other—it gave Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        heartburn whenever he saw them together.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Although Amane was quick to dismiss the girlfriend talk, Itsuki didn't seem particularly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        offended. Amane often said things like that, so Itsuki just laughed. "You're heartless.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        So lemme ask you: Do you think she's cute, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "She's definitely beautiful, but that's all," answered Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How bland," Itsuki commented.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "She's like a flower on a high peak that my hand could never reach. I've got nothing to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        do with her. Looking is enough."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Fair."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Some quirk of fate may have brought Mahiru and Amane together that other day, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        they were truly destined to live in different worlds.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The idea that Amane, a self-admitted hopeless loser, and Mahiru, the beautiful
        <p></p>
        super-student who could do anything, might one day have any kind of relationship, let alone<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a romantic one, was frankly ridiculous. It was a veritable impossibility.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That's right, Amane thought. There's no need to concern myself with her any further.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…What are you eating?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The theory that the two would never interact again was quickly disproven. Amane was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sucking down some nutritional jelly on his veranda while gazing up at the sky when<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru called to him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It'd been too much of a bother to even go to the convenience store, so he was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        contenting himself with the pouch of jelly he had at home while getting some air when<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru unexpectedly came out onto her own veranda.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She leaned over her railing slightly, looked at the nutritional jelly pouch that was in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's mouth, and frowned.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        For a moment, Amane was frozen; he'd thought she was done with him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Can't you see? It's a ten-second energy-replenishment jelly," he finally answered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Don't tell me that's what you're calling dinner?" Mahiru asked, incredulous.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Of course it is."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's all you're eating? A high school boy, with a healthy appetite?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's none of your business."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Normally, Amane would've eaten a boxed meal from the convenience store or something<p></p>
        <p></p>
        premade from the supermarket, but today, he'd neglected to pick something up for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dinner, and he didn't feel like instant ramen, so this was all he had. It probably<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wouldn't be enough, though, so he planned on having a snack later, too.<p></p>
        <p></p>
