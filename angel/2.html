<h2>Chapter 2: A Cold–and Being Nursed by an Angel</h2>
<p></p>"Amane, your sniffling's annoying."
<p></p>"You're annoying."
<p></p>The next day, it was Amane who'd ended up with the cold.
<p></p>As his classmate and good friend Itsuki Akazawa had pointed out, Amane had been
<p></p>trying and failing to snort everything back up his nose. Trying to exhale only resulted
<p></p>in a terrible, wet, burbling sound.
<p></p>Amane wasn't sure whether it was because his nose was stuffed up or as a result of
<p></p>the cold itself, but a throbbing pain was spreading across the back of his head. He had
<p></p>taken some over-the-counter medicine, but it wasn't making a dent in his symptoms
<p></p>at all. Truly, Amane was a sad sight. His congested face twisted in nasal distress as he
<p></p>became well acquainted with a tissue.
<p></p>Itsuki looked at him, not with concern but exasperation.
<p></p>"You were just fine yesterday, dude."
<p></p>"I got caught in the rain."
<p></p>"Aw, chin up. Wait, didn't you have an umbrella yesterday?"
<p></p>"…I gave it to someone."
<p></p>Naturally, there was no way that Amane could openly admit at school that he'd given
<p></p>it to Mahiru, so he kept things vague.
<p></p>Incidentally, he'd caught a glimpse of Mahiru earlier that day. She'd looked rather well,
<p></p>not ill at all. Amane couldn't help but laugh. Things had gotten completely flipped around.
<p></p>It was his own fault—he'd neglected to warm up in the bath when he'd gotten home.
<p></p>"Don'cha think you were being a little too nice, lending out your umbrella when it was
<p></p>pouring like that?"
<p></p>"Not really. Even if I did, no point complaining about it now."
<p></p>"And who did you give it to anyway? Who was worth catching a cold?"
<p></p>"…A, uh, a lost little kid?"
<p></p>Can't really call her a kid with that body, though… Well, that and the fact that we're the
<p></p>same age. Although, her face did look kinda lost…
<p></p>Something clicked when Amane thought of the unusual encounter that way. Her
<p></p>expression had been exactly that of a lost little kid searching for their parent.
<p></p>"Well, what a kind and upstanding gentleman you are!" Itsuki laughed, unaware of the
<p></p>feelings bubbling up in Amane's chest as he recalled his meeting with Mahiru the day
<p></p>before. "But you know, even if you let someone borrow your umbrella or whatever, I
<p></p>bet your real problem was that you got lazy and didn't warm up afterward. That's why
<p></p>you're dying."
<p></p>"…How do you know that?" Amane shot back.
<p></p>"Well, you don't exactly take good care of yourself. That much was obvious the moment
<p></p>I saw your place. That's why you got sick, dumbass."
<p></p>Amane couldn't really argue with Itsuki's friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn't
<p></p>have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy,
<p></p>and his room was always a total mess. What's more, he subsisted on a diet of
<p></p>convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent
<p></p>meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated
<p></p>with him, asking him how he could live like that.
<p></p>Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had
<p></p>caught a cold overnight.
<p></p>"You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow's Saturday, so focus on
<p></p>getting better," Itsuki advised.
<p></p>"I will…," Amane replied.
<p></p>"If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do." Itsuki's lips curled up
<p></p>at his slight boast.
<p></p>"Shut up. I don't need to hear that from a guy who's already got a girlfriend." Amane
<p></p>slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely
<p></p>irritated.
<p></p>As the day wore on, Amane's condition continued to deteriorate.
<p></p>The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that
<p></p>permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body
<p></p>seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow.
<p></p>Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs
<p></p>to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was
<p></p>rougher than usual, and he felt hot.
<p></p>Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he'd let his
<p></p>guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn
<p></p>for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally
<p></p>not a concern, was now a source of dull agony.
<p></p>When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane's floor, he staggered out on leaden
<p></p>feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted
<p></p>by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
<p></p>Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her
<p></p>shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her
<p></p>complexion vibrant and glowing.
<p></p>Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she
<p></p>was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display.
<p></p>In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day
<p></p>before, neatly folded and closed.
<p></p>She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn't have to, Amane reasoned.
<p></p>"…Really, you don't need to give it back," he said aloud.
<p></p>"It's only natural to return something you borrowed…" Mahiru hesitated as soon as
<p></p>she got a good look at Amane's face. "Um. You have a fever, don't you…?"
<p></p>"…It's got nothing to do with you."
<p></p>Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru—and
<p></p>all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn't have been worth
<p></p>the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure
<p></p>out how Amane had caught a cold.
<p></p>"But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella…"
<p></p>"That's totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim."
<p></p>"It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there
<p></p>in the rain."
<p></p>"I said it's fine, really. It's not something you need to worry about."
<p></p>From Amane's perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self-satisfaction, and
<p></p>he didn't want her fussing over him now.
<p></p>However, Mahiru didn't seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across
<p></p>her graceful features.
<p></p>"…So yeah, it's all good. See ya." Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so
<p></p>Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru's questioning and concern.
<p></p>Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of
<p></p>his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit
<p></p>as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength
<p></p>left his body.
<p></p>Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his
<p></p>body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him.
<p></p>Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it
<p></p>wouldn't break, and he wouldn't fall. Surely it would catch him, and he'd be fine.
<p></p>The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there's no avoiding it…, Amane thought,
<p></p>resigning himself to the pain.
<p></p>However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright.
<p></p>"…Just as I thought; I can't leave you alone like this." Amane heard a fragile voice through
<p></p>his feverish haze. "I'll repay your favor."
<p></p>Amane's head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up.
<p></p>Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and
<p></p>opened the door to his apartment.
<p></p>"I'm going to help you inside. There's no other way, so please forgive the intrusion."
<p></p>Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument.
<p></p>The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering
<p></p>his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he
<p></p>didn't have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had
<p></p>descended to care for him instead.
<p></p>Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his
<p></p>place until it was too late. It wasn't until he saw the condition his home was in that he
<p></p>regretted ever letting Mahiru enter.
<p></p>His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and
<p></p>main living space.
<p></p>It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane's parents
<p></p>were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the
<p></p>neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always
<p></p>thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment
<p></p>was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he
<p></p>wasn't about to complain.
<p></p>Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were
<p></p>not kept especially tidy. Various items were scattered all over the living room, and
<p></p>needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom.
<p></p>"This is too pitiful to look at." The angel, Amane's savior, gave him a frank assessment
<p></p>of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming
<p></p>appearance.
<p></p>Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he'd known that he'd be
<p></p>bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied
<p></p>up a bit, but it was too late for that now.
<p></p>Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane
<p></p>into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some
<p></p>serious cleaning sometime soon.
<p></p>"First, I'm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get
<p></p>back. You can do that, right?" Mahiru asked.
<p></p>"…You're coming back?"
<p></p>"My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,"
<p></p>Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt
<p></p>toward her when she was soaking wet the day before.
<p></p>Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he
<p></p>was told and started changing out of his school uniform.
<p></p>"It's really a mess in here; there's nowhere to even step… How can anyone live like
<p></p>this…?"
<p></p>As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next
<p></p>room, and felt quite ashamed.
<p></p>After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without
<p></p>realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was
<p></p>the first thing he saw.
<p></p>Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side,
<p></p>peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream.
<p></p>"…What time is it?" Amane asked, confused.
<p></p>"Seven in the evening," Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. "You slept for several hours."
<p></p>As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had
<p></p>poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was
<p></p>able to take a look at his surroundings.
<p></p>Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.
<p></p>He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did,
<p></p>his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth.
<p></p>There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn't have any of those at
<p></p>his place, and he looked up at Mahiru.
<p></p>"I brought it from home," she answered immediately.
<p></p>Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks, either. Mahiru
<p></p>must have brought that over as well.
<p></p>"…Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble."
<p></p>"It's fine."
<p></p>There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru's curt answer.
<p></p>Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn't mean
<p></p>that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was
<p></p>already talking with a boy she barely knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That
<p></p>she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only
<p></p>natural.
<p></p>"For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It's better
<p></p>to take it with something in your stomach… Are you hungry at all?" Mahiru asked gently.
<p></p>"Mm, a little bit," Amane answered.
<p></p>"Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you're welcome to have
<p></p>some."
<p></p>"…Huh, you made it yourself?"
<p></p>"Is there anyone else here but me? If you don't want it, I'll eat it all alone."
<p></p>"No, I'll eat it! Please let me eat it!"
<p></p>Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment,
<p></p>he was caught off guard.
<p></p>Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he'd never heard
<p></p>rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn't be awful.
<p></p>Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane's sudden bow and insistence that he
<p></p>would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting
<p></p>on the side table.
<p></p>"I'll bring it to you, so take your temperature first."
<p></p>"Okay," Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning
<p></p>his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away.
<p></p>"Do it after I leave the room, please." There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane
<p></p>spied that the girl's pale cheeks were tinged red.
<p></p>Amane hadn't thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn't consider
<p></p>it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn't
<p></p>accustomed to seeing much skin.
<p></p>Mahiru's alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned
<p></p>away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her
<p></p>shyness almost palpable.
<p></p>…Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is.
<p></p>Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he'd also never had any
<p></p>special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He
<p></p>had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire
<p></p>her like one would a distant masterpiece.
<p></p>Mahiru wasn't some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking
<p></p>slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some
<p></p>idol, and it was strangely adorable.
<p></p>The two didn't have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that
<p></p>he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird
<p></p>if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself.
<p></p>"…Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?" he asked.
<p></p>"Y-you don't have to tell me," Mahiru answered dismissively. "I'll be right back." She
<p></p>turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away.
<p></p>It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe
<p></p>because of all the clutter. Probably the latter.
<p></p>After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out
<p></p>this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh.
<p></p>…Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened.
<p></p>Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too
<p></p>dangerous; she could be attacked or something.
<p></p>Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must've meant she was worried about him.
<p></p>Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn't
<p></p>think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of
<p></p>obligation.
<p></p>Amane's mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
<p></p>Then came a hesitant knock at the door.
<p></p>"…I've brought the porridge."
<p></p>At the sound of Mahiru's concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered
<p></p>again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature.
<p></p>"I haven't taken my temperature yet," he called back.
<p></p>"I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though…"
<p></p>"Sorry, I spaced out."
<p></p>Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few
<p></p>moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to
<p></p>look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn't bad
<p></p>enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high.
<p></p>"Okay, I'm finished," Amane said as he put his shirt back on.
<p></p>Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting
<p></p>on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes.
<p></p>"What was your temperature?" she asked.
<p></p>"Thirty-eight point three. I'll be better after I take some medicine and get some more
<p></p>sleep."
<p></p>"…Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won't eliminate the virus
<p></p>itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job."
<p></p>Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed
<p></p>Amane.
<p></p>Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then
<p></p>opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely
<p></p>watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had
<p></p>done that intentionally because she'd thought it'd be easier on Amane's stomach.
<p></p>She'd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting
<p></p>colds.
<p></p>The dish wasn't steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru
<p></p>hadn't brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool
<p></p>down first.
<p></p>Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl
<p></p>with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and
<p></p>had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of
<p></p>the rice mixed easily.
<p></p>"Here you go. It shouldn't be too hot."
<p></p>"Mm, thank you."
<p></p>Mahiru gave Amane a puzzled look as he received the bowl, but then he merely stared
<p></p>at the porridge while his spoon hovered over it.
<p></p>"…What is it; you want me to feed you? Sorry, but that's not on the menu," Mahiru
<p></p>asserted.
<p></p>"Nobody asked for that, okay? It's just… So I guess you can cook, too, huh?" Amane asked.
<p></p>"I live alone, so of course I can." The girl's words stung, a heavy reminder of Amane's
<p></p>own domestic failures. "But before you learn to cook, you should learn to clean up your
<p></p>room, Fujimiya."
<p></p>"Yes, ma'am…"
<p></p>Mahiru had quickly and thoroughly put him in his place. Amane grumbled quietly and
<p></p>scooped up some of the porridge, stuffing the spoon into his mouth in a bid to end the
<p></p>conversation.
<p></p>The flavor of the lightly salted rice spread across his tongue as he ate the porridge.
<p></p>The mellow sourness of the pickled plums pulled it all together. It was truly a dish with
<p></p>a perfect balance of flavors.
<p></p>Amane didn't like pickled plums that were too salty, but these had a milder taste and
<p></p>a bit of sweetness. They were actually a favorite of his. Often, he liked to top green tea
<p></p>rice with pickled plums.
<p></p>"It's good."
<p></p>"Thanks for saying so. Though, really, once you've tasted one rice porridge, I think
<p></p>you've probably tasted them all." Mahiru's answer appeared indifferent, save for the
<p></p>very slightest beginnings of a smile.
<p></p>Without meaning to, Amane found himself staring at the beautiful girl's relieved
<p></p>expression. Something about it seemed quite different from the more outgoing smile
<p></p>he occasionally caught her wearing at school.
<p></p>"…Fujimiya?" Mahiru asked.
<p></p>"Sorry, it's nothing," he answered.
<p></p>Amane thought it a shame that such a beautiful smile had been so fleeting, though he
<p></p>kept the musing to himself. Instead, he shoveled spoonful after spoonful of porridge
<p></p>into his mouth.
<p></p>"…Anyhow, you rest today. And make sure to replenish your fluids. If you need to wipe
<p></p>away sweat, use this. I've put water into your washbowl, so make sure to wet it and
<p></p>wring it out before wiping, okay?"
<p></p>After Amane had eaten, Mahiru diligently prepared an unopened sports drink, readied
<p></p>the bowl of water, and laid out a towel and spare cooling sheets. All had been carefully
<p></p>placed on the side table in Amane's bedroom.
<p></p>There was no way Mahiru was going to stay over at the home of a boy she barely knew.
<p></p>Amane wouldn't have stood for it if she'd tried. Thus, Mahiru had prepared everything
<p></p>Amane could've needed while he rested, and he was grateful for her diligence, though
<p></p>he stared at her the whole time she got everything ready.
<p></p>This is an awful lot just to repay a favor. Once this is over, I guess we won't have much
<p></p>reason to interact. It's a one-off thing, a freak occurrence; that's all.
<p></p>Well, since we won't be talking ever again, I guess it's all right to ask about that thing I
<p></p>want to know.
<p></p>Whether from the medicine or his nap, Amane's head felt clearer, though he was still
<p></p>exhausted.
<p></p>"Hey, there's something I've been wondering…," he started.
<p></p>"What is it?" Mahiru turned to look at him from where she was setting up all the
<p></p>essentials he'd need.
<p></p>"Why were you sitting out in the rain? Did you have a fight with your boyfriend or
<p></p>something?" The strange behavior that'd kicked off this whole chain of events had
<p></p>been on Amane's mind since he'd first noticed it. Mahiru had been rocking back and
<p></p>forth on a swing in the pouring rain. What could she have been doing there?
<p></p>It was precisely because Amane had been curious about Mahiru's slight resemblance
<p></p>to a lost child that he'd offered her his umbrella in the first place. He'd never
<p></p>discovered why she'd been out there in the storm to begin with, however.
<p></p>Amane had thought Mahiru had been waiting for someone, so he'd guessed that there
<p></p>was a boy she was dating, even wondering if perhaps she and her boyfriend had gotten
<p></p>into an argument. In response to Amane's question, Mahiru looked at him as if she was
<p></p>fed up.
<p></p>"Sorry, but I don't have a boyfriend, and I have no plans to get one," she replied.
<p></p>"Huh? Why?" Amane asked almost unconsciously.
<p></p>"Let me ask you, why did you assume I was dating someone?"
<p></p>"With how popular you are, I thought you'd have at least one or two boyfriends."
<p></p>Something about this back-and-forth made Mahiru seem much more like a normal girl
<p></p>to Amane. She was kind but strong-willed. To other people, though, he was sure she
<p></p>seemed quite different. Mahiru was a beautiful girl who was tidy, sweet, quiet, and
<p></p>humble. Her pretty face, so lovely that she was often called an angel, turned heads
<p></p>wherever she went, and her body was petite but possessed abundant curves. The
<p></p>briefest sight of her instilled a strange, momentary feeling of wanting to protect her.
<p></p>That quality, combined with her excellent sense of style, made her an object of desire
<p></p>for many a schoolboy.
<p></p>On top of all that, her grades kept her at the top of her class, and she was an all-around
<p></p>excellent athlete. What's more, Amane had just learned firsthand that she was good at
<p></p>cooking, too. That certainly wouldn't hurt her popularity.
<p></p>Just one glance was enough to know there must have been plenty of guys who were
<p></p>after her, and Amane knew for a fact that quite a few of his own classmates had
<p></p>romantic feelings for Mahiru. She could've had her pick of the litter, and it hadn't
<p></p>occurred to him that she might not be seeing anyone.
<p></p>That was what Amane had meant when he'd said that thing about one or two
<p></p>boyfriends, but the moment she'd heard those words, Mahiru's expression had
<p></p>stiffened, if only for a moment.
<p></p>"I don't have a boyfriend, and what's more, I'm not the kind of girl who would keep the
<p></p>company of several boys at once. It's absolutely out of the question."
<p></p>Mahiru's eyes were so cold, they sent a shiver down Amane's spine. He realized
<p></p>immediately that he'd stepped on some kind of social land mine.
<p></p>It might have been because of his sickness, but he felt a chill pass over him, and the
<p></p>room seemed drafty all of a sudden.
<p></p>"Sorry, that's not what I meant. I apologize," Amane said.
<p></p>"…No, I'm sorry for getting fired up."
<p></p>Mahiru bowing her head seemed to disperse the cold, tense atmosphere of the room.
<p></p>More than being "fired up," Mahiru's icy reply to Amane's question had been like a
<p></p>blizzard, though he knew better than to point that out.
<p></p>"Anyway, that's not what was going on at all. I was just trying to cool my head a bit…
<p></p>And I really am sorry that you caught a cold because you were worried about me,"
<p></p>Mahiru explained.
<p></p>"It's fine. I mean, it was my decision, after all. I feel kind of guilty about all this, actually.
<p></p>I only gave you the umbrella as a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing. I'll try not to
<p></p>bother you once this is all over."
<p></p>Amane was sure that Mahiru was only there to help out of some sense of obligation,
<p></p>but when she heard what he had to say, she blinked a few times and gave him a curious
<p></p>look. It must have intrigued her to hear that he wouldn't be troubling her again.
<p></p>"We don't really have any reason to interact, so it's not like it'll be a big deal. I mean,
<p></p>even if you're the most beautiful girl in our grade, and a genius, and everyone calls you
<p></p>an angel, I wasn't trying to hook up with you; I swear. You don't think that this was
<p></p>some kind of scheme or something, do you?" Amane inquired.
<p></p>Mahiru looked away a little awkwardly. A bitter smile spread across her lips, as if she'd
<p></p>been waiting for Amane to say those exact words. Finally, he realized that she wasn't
<p></p>just acting cagey. Mahiru had probably wound up in that sort of situation a few times
<p></p>before. A guy trying to get in with a beautiful girl by making her feel indebted was,
<p></p>unfortunately, not unheard of.
<p></p>It explained why Mahiru had been so wary of Amane that day in the rain. She hadn't
<p></p>been upset at him; she'd just been trying to protect herself.
<p></p>"It must be so irritating. Being bothered by guys you don't even like," Amane said.
<p></p>"Well, that's true, but…" Mahiru's voice trailed off.
<p></p>"Called it," quipped Amane, a little surprised to hear her admit it.
<p></p>So the quiet, charming, model student, the one everybody makes a big fuss over, the one
<p></p>everybody calls an angel, does have things she doesn't like. Why, she even gets annoyed
<p></p>from time to time, just like the rest of us mortals. The thought gave Amane the sudden
<p></p>impression that he was seeing the real Mahiru for the first time.
<p></p>Unfortunately, the way she glared back at Amane seemed to suggest that she was really
<p></p>regretting having ever met him. It looked like she resented him for making her reveal
<p></p>how she really felt.
<p></p>Further proof that the angelic honor student has real emotions hidden deep down,
<p></p>Amane thought.
<p></p>"I don't really see the problem with that," admitted Amane. "Actually, I'm relieved. It's
<p></p>nice to hear that the angel finds that stuff just as annoying as normal humans."
<p></p>"…Please stop calling me that." Mahiru obviously hated the title others had given her.
<p></p>With disapproval in her eyes, she continued to gaze at Amane.
<p></p>Even her displeasure seemed interesting to Amane, who smiled again and said, "Not
<p></p>to worry, I won't bother you again without a good reason."
<p></p>Mahiru's eyes opened wide as if his declaration had caught her by surprise. With the
<p></p>faintest whisper of a smile crossing her lips, she bowed sharply and left.
<p></p>Amane lay in bed, staring vacantly up at the ceiling while thinking about Mahiru.
<p></p>Even though the medicine had taken effect, he was, unsurprisingly, still feeling sluggish.
<p></p>If he relaxed, sleep would surely claim him in no time at all. He closed his eyes and
<p></p>reflected on the events of the day.
<p></p>No one would ever believe him if he told them that he'd been nursed back to health by
<p></p>an angel with a surprisingly sharp tongue. The day's events were a secret shared only
<p></p>by Amane and Mahiru.
<p></p>It feels kinda weird to call it a secret. It's more like it'd be a real pain to explain the whole
<p></p>story. It's just easier not to tell anybody, that's all, Amane reasoned.
<p></p>As he slowly lost consciousness, Amane told himself that, when tomorrow came, he
<p></p>and Mahiru would be nothing more than mere acquaintances again.
