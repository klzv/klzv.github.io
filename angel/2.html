        "…I guess I don't need to ask whether you can cook for yourself. It definitely doesn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seem like you can, at least. And yet you're living on your own, even though you can't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cook or clean…" Mahiru's observation was brutally honest.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shut up. That's none of your business," Amane fired back, though he knew he couldn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        argue with the truth. He frowned and finished off the remainder of his jelly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He'd wised up about cleaning his place a couple days ago and was definitely planning<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to do something about it sometime soon. Ruminating on Mahiru's scolding only<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seemed to make Amane want to do it less, however. It also made him wonder why she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was making such a fuss over him in the first place.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru just stared at Amane, then let out a soft sigh. "…Wait here," she instructed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        before disappearing back into her own apartment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What now?" Amane grumbled as he listened to the clatter of the glass door closing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        behind her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He'd been told to wait, but he didn't know what for. Turning a puzzled gaze toward<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's apartment, Amane stood there obediently, but there was no immediate<p></p>
        <p></p>
        answer.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It's starting to get chilly out here; I'd like to go inside, but…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He'd been told to stay put, so that was what he'd do. The autumn evening was colder<p></p>
        <p></p>
        than expected, and Amane's loosely fitting, casual clothes did little to help him stay<p></p>
        <p></p>
        warm.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Amane waited, watching his deep breaths come out white in the cold, he heard the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        electronic bell chime from his front door, announcing a visitor. It was pretty obvious<p></p>
        <p></p>
        who it was.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Truly puzzled, Amane made his way toward the front door, dodging scattered clothes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and magazines on the floor.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He knew who it was without even looking through the peephole, so he slid his feet into<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a pair of slippers, took the chain off the door, and opened it. As expected, he came
        <p></p>
        face-to-face with waves of sandy-blond hair.<p></p>
        "…What are you doing?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I couldn't stand how badly you were neglecting your health. These are just some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        leftovers I had, but please take them," Mahiru stated plainly as she abruptly stuck a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hand out in front of her. In her delicate palm, somewhat smaller than Amane's own,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was a plastic container. He could vaguely see some sort of stewed dish through the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        semi-transparent lid. He couldn't tell exactly what it was, however, as the container<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had filled with steam from the warmth of the food.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to understand the confused look in Amane's eyes as he stood there<p></p>
        <p></p>
        blinking. She let out a deep sigh. "You're not eating properly. Nutritional supplements<p></p>
        <p></p>
        are just that—supplements. You can't live on them alone."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What are you, my mom?" Amane jeered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I believe what I said is common sense. Also, shouldn't you have tidied up your room<p></p>
        <p></p>
        by now? There still isn't any room to walk."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru narrowed her eyes in obvious disappointment as she looked past Amane at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the room beyond, and Amane's words stalled in his throat.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I have, a little."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, you haven't. Normally, people don't drop their clothes on the floor."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Those just… fell there."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That wouldn't happen if you washed, dried, folded, and put them away properly. Also,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you should bundle up your magazines after you're done reading them. That way you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        won't slip on one and fall."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It wasn't that he couldn't sense the small barbs in her words, but he also understood<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that Mahiru was, for some reason, genuinely concerned for him, so he couldn't dismiss<p></p>
        <p></p>
        everything she was saying. After all, the clutter of magazines had almost tripped the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        both of them up just the other night. She had a point.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had no rebuttal. He screwed up his face, squeezed his mouth shut tight, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sullenly took the container from Mahiru's hand.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The food suffused his palm with a welcome warmth, especially after all the time spent<p></p>
        <p></p>
        standing on his chilly veranda.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So I can eat this?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If you don't need it, I can throw it out," Mahiru answered flatly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, I'm grateful for it. I don't usually get to eat an angel's home cooking."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Stop calling me that, seriously."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Using her school nickname was a kind of petty, needling revenge for her critical<p></p>
        <p></p>
        comments. Her feelings about the moniker were written clearly across her pale cheeks<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as they turned red.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was no doubt about it—she hated being called an angel. Were he in the same<p></p>
        <p></p>
        position, Amane was certain he would hate it, too. That hardly needed to be said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Despite understanding Mahiru's stance, Amane couldn't help but smile when he saw<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her looking up at him with flushed cheeks and tiny, bitter tears forming.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not going to say I'm sorry," he declared.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was clear that any further teasing would be certain to wreck what little goodwill she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had left for him, so Amane figured it was prudent to give it a rest.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        We're not even that close.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru also seemed not to want to hear any more, and she emphasized this by clearing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her throat forcefully as she pulled herself together.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her cheeks were still tinged with red, though, so she didn't look like much had changed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, thank you for this. Though, you don't really need to worry about what happened<p></p>
        <p></p>
        before," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't. I considered that debt settled. This is for my own self-satisfaction… I saw that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you weren't taking care of yourself, and I was concerned; that's all."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Of course. Mahiru pitied him; that was it. There was no way to hide—she'd gotten a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        very good look at how he lived the other night. Even now, she could see the garbage<p></p>
        <p></p>
        piled up in the hallway behind him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You need to at least start eating proper meals and… get your life together!" she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        scolded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yes, Mom," Amane answered sarcastically. He was getting a little tired of listening to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's nagging.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane churlishly carried the meal Mahiru had brought him back into his apartment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He grabbed a pair of disposable chopsticks he'd gotten at the supermarket and sat<p></p>
        <p></p>
        down on his living room couch, eager to sample the flavors of her cooking.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He remembered enjoying the rice porridge that she'd brought him before, even though<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his sense of taste had been dulled by sickness. The slow-cooked porridge had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        possessed a rich, comforting taste that had been gentle on his stomach. If that was any<p></p>
        <p></p>
        indication, Mahiru's cooking was undoubtedly quite good, but now it was time to find<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out for sure.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As he hastily opened the lid of the container, the savory scent of stew drifted gently up<p></p>
        <p></p>
        at him. Various root vegetables had been cooked together with some chicken. The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        light-colored sauce underscored the vibrant hues of carrots and green beans, all of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        which had been cut into bite-size pieces.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's stomach growled, reminding him that the only thing he'd had to eat was some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nutritional jelly. He hastily snapped his disposable chopsticks apart and brought a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        piece of daikon radish to his mouth.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yum."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's mouth was greeted with a complex flavor.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Typical of the health-conscious Mahiru, the dish was only lightly seasoned, spiced<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mostly with dashi stock. It was immediately obvious that she hadn't used storebought,
        <p></p>
        granulated dashi. Instead, she'd made it herself using with dried bonito fish<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and kombu seaweed. The difference in taste was night and day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As he chewed it thoroughly, the flavor of the dashi and the other seasonings, as well<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as the taste of the vegetables, spread gently through his mouth. Amane had never been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a fan of veggies. He usually went out of his way to avoid them, but in this dish, the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        essence of each ingredient came together in perfect harmony, and Amane happily<p></p>
        <p></p>
        savored them all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There wasn't much chicken. Perhaps Mahiru had done that on purpose as if to tell him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to eat more vegetables. What little meat there was had been cooked plump and juicy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was nothing to complain about there, Amane thought, aside from the quantity.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        For something made by a high school girl, the ingredients were a little plain, but her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        skill more than made up for it. That Amane so readily enjoyed the food was enough of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a testament to that fact.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It would have been even better with some rice, and maybe some miso soup or clear<p></p>
        <p></p>
        broth on the side, but Amane didn't have any prepared. He was all out of rice anyway,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so that modest wish was not destined to be granted that night. It was too late now, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he regretted not buying any instant rice packets beforehand.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That angel's amazing," Amane said to himself as he devoured the perfectly seasoned<p></p>
        <p></p>
        vegetables, chopsticks never slowing for a second.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        To think, she's great at school, and sports, and all kinds of housework.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If Mahiru had been there to hear Amane's praise, she would have hated it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Here's this back. The food was good."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The following evening, Amane carried the borrowed container over to Mahiru's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apartment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The boy was certainly bad at housework, but not so bad that he couldn't wash<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something before giving it back. In his hand, he held the carefully cleaned little box,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        knowing that it was good manners to return it only after it had been thoroughly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        washed and dried.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had appeared the moment Amane rang the doorbell without even checking to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        see who it was, as if she'd been expecting him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She was wearing a wine-colored knit dress, and when she saw her visitor, her eyes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        narrowed gently. She quickly checked the container and said, "You washed it and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        everything, huh? Look at you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane frowned slightly when she praised him like a little child.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, thank you for taking the time," Mahiru continued. "Now take this." She pressed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a new, warm container into Amane's hand.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        From what he could tell, there was saute ed pork and eggplant inside. It seemed to have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cooled enough that the lid hadn't fogged up, for Amane could clearly spy the color of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        eggplant, grilled pork, and sprinkled sesame seeds through the clear top. From the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        color, he guessed the sauce was probably miso flavor. The sight of the eggplant with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slight scorch marks and the lustrous pork definitely roused his appetite.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        No one would deny that it looked delicious, but Amane couldn't understand why he'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been handed dinner again.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, um, I just came to return the container," he tried to explain.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "This is today's dinner," Mahiru answered coolly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, I get that, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I just want to ask: You don't have any allergies, do you? Don't get the wrong idea,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        though. I won't be catering to your tastes or anything."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't, but… I mean, I can't accept your food again."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Taking a portion of the girl's dinner for the second time in a row seemed wrong to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane. His malnourished body was grateful for the food, and Mahiru was clearly a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        much better cook than other girls her age, and the meal he was holding was sure to be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        delicious, but it also held no small amount of danger.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If someone from school saw the two of them meeting like this, it could turn into a big<p></p>
        <p></p>
        debacle. That would be the end of Amane's quiet student life for sure.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        These apartments were meant for single occupancy, but the rent was pretty high<p></p>
        <p></p>
        because of the building's location and the amenities. Amane had never seen another<p></p>
        <p></p>
        student from their school in the building—except Mahiru, of course—so he was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        probably worrying over nothing. Even with that mild consolation, his brief meetings<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with the angel still made him wary.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I made too much, so I'm just happy to be rid of it," Mahiru explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…In that case, I'm happy to take it. But someone might get the wrong idea, since<p></p>
        <p></p>
        people usually do this sort of thing for someone they like…," Amane said sheepishly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And do you have the wrong idea?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh, I guess not."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        One look at Mahiru's expression was enough to clear up any misconceptions about her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        feelings toward Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was no way that a beautiful, talented girl like Mahiru could possibly fall for an<p></p>
        <p></p>
        oblivious slob like Amane. Sure, a cute next-door neighbor bringing him food seemed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like something out of a romantic comedy, but there was no romance here—and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        certainly no comedy. The situation was as devoid of those elements as Amane's own<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apartment was devoid of rice.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        What kindness existed in the angel's barbed words had been born only from pity.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well then, there's no problem, is there? And anyway, it looks like you were surviving<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on convenience-store meals and side dishes from the supermarket," stated Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How could you tell?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's not hard to see that your kitchen has barely been used, and you have a ton of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        disposable chopsticks from the convenience store and the supermarket on your desk.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Besides, I can tell just by looking at you. You've got an unhealthy complexion."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's expression froze. Mahiru had gotten all that just from one visit to his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apartment. Everything she'd said had been spot-on; he had no room to argue.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…All right, I'll be going."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru bowed and went back inside her apartment, having said what she'd wanted to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        say and given him what she'd wanted to give.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane looked at the container in his hands as he listened to the jangling sound of the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chain on the other side of Mahiru's front door slide into place. The heat from the food<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was beginning to warm the palms of his hands. He let out a soft sigh and returned to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his place.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As expected, the stir-fried sesame miso eggplant and pork was delicious. Amane found<p></p>
        <p></p>
        himself wishing even more than yesterday that he'd bought some rice.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As time went on, Amane began swapping an empty container for a full one every day,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and his diet improved dramatically.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's cooking was always light and healthy, and since every dish made him want<p></p>
        <p></p>
        rice, Amane started fixing microwave packets with each meal. The angel had a variety<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of cuisines in her repertoire: Japanese, Chinese, even Western. Each day brought<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something new, but every single meal was delicious, and Amane developed an appetite<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like never before.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Like a wild animal grown fat on handouts, Amane quickly came to rely on Mahiru's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        charity. Even as he continued to obediently accept container after container, he knew<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it was presumptuous to expect a meal every day. Still, he happily—and hungrily—<p></p>
        <p></p>
        licked his chops each time.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You're looking good lately. You fix your diet or something?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki took a long, hard look at Amane one day during lunch. Apparently, his complexion<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had improved—probably because he was finally supplying his body with much-<p></p>
        <p></p>
        needed nutrition.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane knew his friend was perceptive, and he felt a bit of a cold sweat break out as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he slurped the udon noodles he'd ordered for school lunch.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Itsuki, you scare me," he said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Why's that? Do you mean I'm right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh, well, I guess you could say I've had no choice but to reexamine my lifestyle recently."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Whenever Amane passed by Mahiru near their apartments, she would chide him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gently to take care of himself, and she was regularly sharing her dinner with him. It<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was only natural that his life had improved. On the one hand, he wanted to call her his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        guardian angel, but a small part of him also felt like she was meddling where it was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        none of her business.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had indirectly confirmed Itsuki's suspicions by dodging the question, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki cackled with delighted laughter. "Yeah, I knew it. You always looked unhealthy<p></p>
        <p></p>
        'cause the way you were living was so crappy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shut up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But what made you decide to 'reexamine your lifestyle'?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I guess I was forced to."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, your mom found out?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You're not right, but you're not far off, either."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru really did sound like Amane's mom at times. She was much too young and too<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cute to be a mother, though. Still, the way the girl went to such lengths to care for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane made it hard for him to refuse her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Say, Itsuki? Do I really seem that unhealthy?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm… Well, to start with, you're pretty pale. I guess you're tall enough, but you're<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gangly. You're also always shuffling around all apathetic-like, so you look like a zombie."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But that's just how I look…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You think I don't know that? Try looking like one of the living for a change."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't be absurd… Wait, but seriously… a zombie…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wasn't really sure because he almost never bothered to closely check his own<p></p>
        <p></p>
        face in the mirror, but apparently, he gave others the impression that he was barely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        alive. If he looked half-dead even on a good day, that would explain why Mahiru had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been so worried about him before.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You should pay a little more attention to how other people see you, Amane. You're<p></p>
        <p></p>
        always hunched over, starin' at the ground. It makes you hard to approach, and it's not<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like you go out of your way to get close to anybody, either. If I didn't know any better,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I'd say you're the very definition of a moody teenager."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You sure know how to keep it casual when you're insulting a guy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Fine, fine, I won't sugarcoat it, then. You look like a corpse, and your life is a mess."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki continued teasing his friend, insisting that he ought to take this opportunity to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pay more attention to his appearance and demeanor, not to mention his health.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Sharply turning away, Amane replied sarcastically, "Thanks for your concern."<p></p>

        4 A Chance Encounter<p></p>
        "Ah."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane heard a beautiful voice ring out like a bell from behind him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Recently, he'd grown accustomed to hearing that voice, but only around his apartment<p></p>
        <p></p>
        building. Now he heard it while he was standing in the sweets aisle at the neighborhood<p></p>
        <p></p>
        supermarket.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had never expected Mahiru to acknowledge him in public, so he turned around<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with some bewilderment to see her standing there, eyes wide.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A supermarket basket hung from her arm, and inside it sat a daikon radish and some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tofu, as well as a package of chicken thighs and a carton of milk. These were likely the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ingredients for her dinner tonight.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        This was nothing special. Amane had coincidentally stopped by the candy aisle at the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        same time. That was all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Just so you know, this is merely a coincidence," Amane asserted. "It's not like I'm<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stalking you or anything."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I know, I know." Mahiru nodded. "We're both just here because it's the closest<p></p>
        <p></p>
        supermarket." Before Amane had a chance to agree, he heard the girl mutter, "Really,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        though, that's the first thing that came to mind…?" She stared down at a notebook that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she was carrying.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was just like the meticulous Mahiru to dutifully record everything she needed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Ignoring Amane in favor of her flower-patterned notebook, Mahiru brushed past the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sweets and began searching the condiments on display in the next aisle.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Something about Mahiru searching the shelves for kitchen staples and murmuring<p></p>
        <p></p>
        things like soy sauce and mirin in her lovely voice seemed cute to Amane. It was clear<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that the girl was in a strange kind of mood, however.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mirin is right here. Look," Amane said, pointing it out.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, not that—I'm looking for the low-alcohol kind. I can't buy that, since I'm underage,"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "This is considered alcohol?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mirin is sweet rice wine, after all. The ones that are specifically for cooking still have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        alcohol, but they add in salt to make it gross to drink, so even underage people can buy<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had been about to hand her a bottle of mirin when she suddenly refused it,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shook her head, and instead placed the low-alcohol alternative in her basket.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Learn something every day…" This was all new to Amane, who did so little housework<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that even these simple tidbits seemed revelatory. He watched Mahiru as she moved<p></p>
        <p></p>
        quickly on down the aisle, stopping in front of a shelf full of soy sauce.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru frowned, as if she had only just noticed the price labels. "…Bargain price, limit<p></p>
        <p></p>
        one bottle per person…" She had apparently been intending to buy a spare. Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        grumbled in disappointment and turned to glance at Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Maybe… I could buy one, too?" Amane quickly sensed what Mahiru had been trying<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to convey with her eyes, and with a wry smile, he picked up a bottle of soy sauce. When<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he did, her lips formed a satisfied arch.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's helpful to have someone who understands," she said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You're more economical than I expected," Amane commented.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I don't see why I shouldn't find the best prices when I can. Cut down on needless<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expense, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I wonder if that's what they call a thrifty mentality. Well, as long as you're living on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        an allowance from your parents, I guess that's for the best."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane may have technically lived alone, but in reality, his parents still supported him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His family was fairly rich, and they covered the rent of his clean, safe apartment, took<p></p>
        <p></p>
        care of his school fees, and provided him with a more-than-fair allowance. Amane had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        never had to worry about his expenses, but he was grateful for everything his parents<p></p>
        <p></p>
        did for him, so he tried not to waste money.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…That's right. We depend on their support, so it's important to be frugal," Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        replied matter-of-factly, taking stock of the contents of her basket. Her voice was cold,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like something had stolen away her warmth.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane flinched at Mahiru's flat tone, but when she looked up from her groceries, her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expression had returned to normal. The gloomy eyes he'd seen in that brief moment<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were already gone.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Anyway, are you really buying that?" Mahiru asked, as if to change the subject,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looking at the packs of instant rice and the container of potato salad that were in the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        basket that Amane was holding.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The meals that Mahiru was sharing with him were, of course, delicious, but they<p></p>
        <p></p>
        weren't enough on their own. To compensate, Amane would pick up a staple food and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        side salad like he'd done today.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, it's dinner," Amane explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's unhealthy," Mahiru shot back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're so fussy. I'm buying a salad, aren't I?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "A potato salad… How is your body still functioning?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mind your own business."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru put wordless pressure on him, scrutinizing him with eyes that reproached him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and told him to eat more vegetables. Amane turned away and let Mahiru go ahead of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chatting about this and that, the two bought their respective things. Amane had started<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to pack his purchases into a plastic bag, but Mahiru produced a reusable bag she'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        brought and quickly put everything into it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She was truly an environmentally conscious angel.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had only brought the one bag, however, and Amane was a little anxious that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the quantity of groceries was too much for it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With the milk, soy sauce, and low-alcohol cooking mirin, that was four liters of liquid<p></p>
        <p></p>
        altogether, and if they weighed anything like water, that meant four kilograms right<p></p>
        <p></p>
        there. There was still the whole daikon radish and the other ingredients to consider,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        too. The bag had to be really heavy. Everything was packed in quite neatly, but still, it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would surely be hard work carrying it all the way back to Amane and Mahiru's building.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She's been cooking for me, so she must be going through more seasonings and ingredients<p></p>
        <p></p>
        than she normally does.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She's gotta be making a lot in order to split the dishes with me. The amount she gives me<p></p>
        <p></p>
        is always nearly a whole meal's worth. Mahiru says it's all just extra, but she must be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        making a lot of food on purpose.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After Mahiru had gone through so much trouble to take care of Amane, it'd wound his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pride if he didn't do anything to help her out now.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As soon as Mahiru finished packing the reusable bag, Amane took hold of the handles<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and lifted it. It wasn't all that heavy to him, of course, but he could tell that it would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        definitely be difficult for her to carry for very long.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru may have been really good at sports, but pure arm strength was an entirely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        different matter. Surely, Amane thought, his eyes tracing her slim figure under her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        clothing, surely there was no way that her slender arms could command the power<p></p>
        <p></p>
        needed to lift these heavy groceries.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        caramel-coloured eyes blinked rapidly. Mahiru looked surprised—or maybe a little<p></p>
        <p></p>
        concerned.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm not stealing it or anything," Amane said in his defense.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not worried about that," Mahiru replied. "It's just… I can carry my own bags, you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        know?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It'd be more charming if you'd be quiet and let me take care of you for a change,"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        quipped Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's basically saying I'm not charming," Mahiru answered flatly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, think about how you act at school, then compare that to how you act toward<p></p>
        <p></p>
        me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru took a step back. Maybe Amane had unknowingly hit a nerve. The version of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        herself that she showed at school—the kind, gentle, modest girl everyone was familiar<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with—that was not the person Amane knew. Yes, Mahiru was always kind to him, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she was also far more direct. She never sugarcoated anything or hid behind niceties.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Everything she said to him was brief and frank.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane took advantage of Mahiru's stunned silence and briskly sauntered off toward<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the supermarket exit, holding his schoolbag in one hand and the reusable shopping<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bag stuffed with groceries in the other. He was leaving her behind, but he didn't care.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Unconcerned, he continued on as the gap between them grew wider. He didn't slow<p></p>
        <p></p>
        down or give her a chance to catch up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They had already been standing next to each other in the supermarket, after all. If they<p></p>
        <p></p>
        walked side by side on the way home and somebody saw them, that could start rumors.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        So really, this kind of distance was best for both of them.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane hurried on with his heavy burden while pretending not to be aware of Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As he strode along, he thought he heard someone mutter "Thanks" behind him.<p></p>
        <p></p>

        5 The Angel and the Great Cleaning Campaign<p></p>
        Amane was terrible at housework of any kind, but the thing he was worst at was cleaning.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Surprisingly, he actually could cook. More specifically, he could prepare something hot<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and usually technically edible, as long as he was willing to set aside petty concerns like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        presentation or flavor and also assumed the possibility of grievous bodily injury at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some point during the process. He wasn't completely incapable of preparing food.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Laundry was all right, too. That much was possible for anyone, even Amane. If push<p></p>
        <p></p>
        came to shove, there was always the option of taking his clothes to a coin laundromat.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        All it boiled down to was a matter of stuffing everything into the machine and letting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it run with detergent and water inside. Amane could pull that off, no problem. The one<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thing he was absolutely hopeless with, however, was cleaning.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What do I do?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        One weekend, Amane had finally gotten tired of listening to both Mahiru and Itsuki<p></p>
        <p></p>
        lecture him day in and day out about cleaning his apartment and had resolved to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        finally do something about it. The only problem was that Amane was at a complete<p></p>
        <p></p>
        loss on how to get started.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He knew that this was his own fault, but the first problem was that his things were<p></p>
        <p></p>
        piled up all over the place, and he couldn't figure out how he could even begin to get<p></p>
        <p></p>
        them in order. Unsure of what else to do, Amane started by washing his bedsheets and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        airing out his futon.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        What should come next? he wondered. Clothes and magazines are scattered everywhere,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so there's really no room to walk.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        One small mercy was that he always threw out any food garbage right away, so there<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were no awful stenches or greasy stains. It was simply an enormous amount of clutter<p></p>
        <p></p>
        —enough that it seemed like an insurmountable problem.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Amane sighed softly at the mountain of work before him, the doorbell rang. He let<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out a little gasp.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Rather than a regular visitor, he had begun to think of his neighbor more like a delivery<p></p>
        <p></p>
        person, a blessing from above who just handed over gifts and then left. As he stood<p></p>
        <p></p>
        before his messy room, however, Mahiru seemed like a savior.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane scrambled for his front door but couldn't find his footing. He stumbled, caught<p></p>
        <p></p>
        himself, and carefully crept the rest of the way to the door with one hand pressed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        against the wall for balance.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry, I wanted to pick up my container a little earlier today… What are you doing?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru asked when Amane opened the door.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I was trying to clean," he admitted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru looked at Amane, still off-balance, with a rather astonished expression.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I heard a loud noise just now," she said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I almost fell."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I bet you did. You haven't even begun to clean, have you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I wasn't sure how to start."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I can tell."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane grimaced at Mahiru's comment. It was no less candid than usual, and Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        really couldn't think of anything to justify his lack of progress. Besides, he knew that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        if he got sulky now and lashed out, he wouldn't be able to get her advice on how to go<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about cleaning his apartment. The trouble was that he wasn't sure how exactly to ask<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for Mahiru's help.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I was hoping for some cleaning tips, but I wonder if she'll actually give me any advice…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane hesitated when he saw that Mahiru was peering past him at the clutter beyond.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her eyes conveyed her shock at the disastrous scene behind him. It truly must've been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        an awful sight.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Unbelievable… I'll help you clean your apartment."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even Amane knew that it would be too shameless to ask Mahiru to help him clean.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That's why he'd only been planning to see if she had any suggestions. Never had he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dared to imagine that Mahiru would come right out and offer to help.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I hate the idea that the apartment next to mine is so filthy." Such scathing words, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        again, Amane could offer no argument. "You must think it's so easy to live alone, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you can't even clean up after yourself. Worse, you act like it's no problem, like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        everything will sort itself out eventually, but it clearly hasn't. Why don't you stop and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        take a moment to look at yourself?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was at a loss for words. His mother had always told him that if he was diligent<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about cleaning regularly, it would be easy, but he'd ignored her, and this was the result.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was fully aware that he was suffering the consequences of his own actions.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Look, as long as you keep up with routine cleaning, your place won't get this bad<p></p>
        <p></p>
        again. It's obvious that you have some terrible habits," Mahiru said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You're absolutely right," agreed Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He couldn't get angry with her. He already owed her so much, and she'd been so kind<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to him. Besides, everything she was saying about his past behavior was true. He had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        underestimated how difficult living alone would be, and he really did just sort of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        assume that everything would somehow work itself out, and this was the result.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could only nod solemnly at Mahiru's words.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, is it all right if I start with this room?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Is it all right with you?" Amane answered with a question of his own.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm the one who's offering, so of course it's all right. I'm going to go get ready, so while<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I do, if you have anything you don't want me to see, or any valuables, please put them<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in a closet and lock them up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not worried about that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane refused to even entertain the idea that someone who had been so kind to him,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        even despite her sharp words, might steal from him. Not to mention that Mahiru was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        far too good-hearted to ever harm another person like that.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You're not?" she inquired.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "There's no way that you would do something like that," Amane replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, that's not what I… Look, aren't you worried that I might see something that, as a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        boy, you'd rather hide?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah… uh, well, unfortunately I don't happen to have any such things."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, in that case, it's fine, then. All right, I'm going to go change clothes and fetch<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some cleaning supplies. I don't take cleaning lightly, you know."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru returned to her apartment, and Amane watched her go with a wry smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She came back wearing different clothes: a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pants. The T-shirt closely followed the lines of her body, the delicate fabric bringing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the curves and edges into full relief. Mahiru's long hair had been skillfully gathered<p></p>
        <p></p>
        into a perfectly round bun, and Amane felt strangely uncomfortable being able to see<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the white nape of her neck.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Previously, he had only ever seen her in dresses and skirts, and he found there was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something refreshing about this look. Amane had thought before that boyish clothes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like this probably wouldn't suit her well, but he had clearly been wrong. He was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        beginning to realize that beautiful girls looked good in whatever they put on.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        This new outfit looked comfortable for moving around the house, but it was also a look<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that Mahiru could've worn around town. Amane never would've imagined that these<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were clothes that she was okay with getting dirtied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You don't mind if those get messed up?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I was planning to throw these out soon anyway, so it's fine if they get a bit dirty."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru scanned the cataclysm that was Amane's apartment and sighed softly. "I'm<p></p>
        <p></p>
        only going to say this once: We're going to clean thoroughly, got it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I understand."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Good, then let's get to it. I'm not going to go easy on you, and I won't let this end<p></p>
        <p></p>
        halfway through. I assume you have no objections?" Mahiru had posed the question<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so forcefully that Amane could do nothing but sheepishly reply in the affirmative.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        So began the great battle to clean Amane's apartment. A battle spearheaded by an<p></p>
        <p></p>
        angel.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "First things first, let's toss any clothes into the laundry basket. Usually when you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        clean, you work from top to bottom, but we have to handle the clutter on the floor first<p></p>
        <p></p>
        before we can run the vacuum cleaner. Before we start the wash, we can divide the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        clothes into different loads, since there are too many to wash at once. Do you want to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        split them into things you wear and things you don't wear? Or do you want to wash<p></p>
        <p></p>
        everything?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Just do it however you like…," replied Amane. It seemed so obvious to him now. Of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        course they had to clear the floor before trying to do anything else.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…There isn't any underwear out here or anything, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Those are in my dresser, as you would expect."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's fine, then. We can probably put off washing clothes for now, since even if we<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wash and dry them, we'll kick up dust by cleaning and just end up having to do them<p></p>
        <p></p>
        again. If you're not in a hurry, you can do the laundry after we finish cleaning."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Okay."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Now, regarding the magazines. Really, the only thing to do is to throw them out. I<p></p>
        <p></p>
