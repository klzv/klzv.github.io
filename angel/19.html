        <p></p>
        feelings bubbling up inside him, and in the heat of the moment, he was sure there<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wasn't a man alive who would have felt any different.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Somewhere in this dizzy state of mind, Amane realized how loudly his heart was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thumping. He took several long, slow breaths to try to calm down.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…As long as you like it, I'm happy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I do, and I'm going to take good care of it. Like I do with all of them—the teddy bear,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the key holder, and the bracelet. I'm going to use the hand cream without reservation,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        though." Mahiru smiled slightly, looking embarrassed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could not take it a moment longer. He quickly kicked off his shoes and darted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        down the hallway.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm going to change clothes."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "O-okay. See you when you get back, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even though he had come home to his own single apartment, Amane felt like he was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        being sent off by his new wife. His heart began to pound violently again, and he rushed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        into his bedroom and promptly collapsed on the floor.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        This is worse than I expected…<p></p>
        Amane stifled a yawn as he watched the distant figure of the school principal up on<p></p>
        the stage, giving a stern address. He didn't really care about closing ceremonies or<p></p>
        whatever speech the principal had prepared for the occasion. Frankly, he would have<p></p>
        rather been napping.<p></p>
        Most of the students around him seemed to share that sentiment. Very few people<p></p>
        were actually paying much attention. Everybody else was obviously zoning out.<p></p>
        Still, it wasn't like the students could flaunt their boredom, so Amane put on a serious<p></p>
        expression and silently wished for a speedy end to the proceedings as he let the<p></p>
        principal's speech flow in one ear and out the other, the minutes slipping past as he<p></p>
        pretended to be a model student.<p></p>
        He might have cared about graduation, but this was just the closing ceremony. It didn't<p></p>
        really matter.<p></p>
        "…Ah, I'm so stiff."<p></p>
        "The principal's speeches are always so long."<p></p>
        That was the general sentiment as the students returned to their classrooms.<p></p>
        Nevertheless, everyone sounded quite lively, probably because two weeks of freedom<p></p>
        awaited them after this final homeroom period.<p></p>
        From his seat, Amane watched his cheerful schoolmates who would soon be liberated<p></p>
        from their boring classes, and he let out a quiet sigh.<p></p>
        Spring vacation started tomorrow, but how would he spend it?<p></p>
        He had pretty much just seen his parents, so considering how much it cost to travel,<p></p>
        he figured he could take a pass on going home. But that left him with an empty schedule.<p></p>
        Even if he thoroughly prepared for next year's classes, he would have a lot of time on<p></p>
        his hands. He had considered getting a short-term job, but he hadn't managed to line<p></p>
        up anything, and now there wasn't enough time. The only friends he had to hang out<p></p>
        with over the break were Itsuki and Chitose.<p></p>
        "Hey, hey, Amaneee—"<p></p>
        Itsuki appeared just as he crossed Amane's mind.<p></p>
        When he turned around, he saw Itsuki wearing an enthusiastic smile… and was<p></p>
        immediately suspicious. Itsuki only smiled like that when he had a favor to ask, or<p></p>
        when he was about to suggest something foolish.<p></p>
        "What is it?"<p></p>
        "Are you free starting tomorrow?"<p></p>
        "I guess I am."<p></p>
        "Right, right, I thought so. That's good, veeery good."<p></p>
        Still grinning, Itsuki patted the bag that was hanging from the side of his desk. Even<p></p>
        though everyone was supposed to have cleared out their lockers and desks the day<p></p>
        before, Itsuki's bag was obviously packed full. They didn't even have any classes that<p></p>
        day, so the most he could have possibly needed to bring to school would be a pen and<p></p>
        maybe a binder, but Itsuki's bag looked like it was about to burst.<p></p>
        "…What's all that?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        "Change of clothes."<p></p>
        "Why?"<p></p>
        "'Cause I'm staying at your place…"<p></p>
        Itsuki put on his humblest, most flattering voice and gave Amane an imploring look.<p></p>
        Amane couldn't help but scowl back at his friend.<p></p>
        "Hang on a sec; haven't you ever heard of giving advance notice?"<p></p>
        "Sure I have. Consider yourself notified that I'm coming over, staying several nights,<p></p>
        and bringing the party with me!"<p></p>
        "What, you're gonna keep the whole neighborhood up all night? How well do you think<p></p>
        that's gonna go over, idiot?"<p></p>
        "Geez, dude, I was only joking… But I am serious about you letting me stay with you."<p></p>
        Itsuki rarely failed to let Amane know ahead of time when he was coming over. The<p></p>
        first thing that came to mind was that it was an emergency. Amane struggled to imagine<p></p>
        what it could be about, though.<p></p>
        "I had a fight with my dad this morning."<p></p>
        As if to answer Amane's internal question, Itsuki readily disclosed the reason.<p></p>
        "…About Chitose?"<p></p>
        "Yeah. When my dad gets mad, he won't listen to me unless I leave him alone for a few<p></p>
        days. And I've been staying at Chi's house a lot, so I'd rather not go there. No matter<p></p>
        how accepting her parents are, it doesn't seem right, ya know?"<p></p>
        "But you're okay staying with me?"<p></p>
        "I thought you might let me."<p></p>
        Itsuki probably assumed it would be no big deal. He'd stayed over at Amane's<p></p>
        apartment plenty of times, even before Amane had cleaned up the place.<p></p>
        And it wasn't like Amane didn't want to let his friend stay with him. But there was the<p></p>
        issue of Mahiru. Amane was worried that he would be forcing her to stay in her public<p></p>
        persona during a time when she wanted to relax, since he didn't think she would feel<p></p>
        comfortable acting casually with Itsuki around.<p></p>
        And there was another issue. Recently, he had noticed that Mahiru had been acting<p></p>
        strangely affectionate, and he was afraid that if Itsuki saw her treating a guy that way,<p></p>
        he would immediately get the wrong idea.<p></p>
        "…Let me ask."<p></p>
        Amane sent Mahiru a text message asking her what she thought. She would probably<p></p>
        send him a memo about the shopping before going home, so he expected she would<p></p>
        see it when she did that. It only took a moment for him to send the message, but Itsuki<p></p>
        let out a long, drawn-out sigh.<p></p>
        "What—are you two living together or something?"<p></p>
        "I'll leave you on the floor with no heater or futon."<p></p>
        "Just when I start to think you're a nice guy for letting me stay over, you go and<p></p>
        threaten to stand by and do nothing while I freeze to death?"<p></p>
        "Hey, you got yourself into this."<p></p>
        Amane shot a look at Itsuki that essentially said What are you even going on about, and<p></p>
        Itsuki could only shrug in response.<p></p>
        I'm the one who should be shrugging. I don't want you to cause Mahiru any trouble with<p></p>
        your usual antics.<p></p>
        Itsuki was pretty good at reading the room, so Amane didn't think he would knowingly<p></p>
        bother Mahiru or anything, but he wasn't looking forward to all the teasing he would<p></p>
        have to endure the moment she wasn't around. Amane let out a sigh as Itsuki grinned<p></p>
        at him.<p></p>
        Apparently, Mahiru sometimes checked her phone at school, because Amane had<p></p>
        already gotten a response: "I'll make dinner as usual if you buy enough food for three."<p></p>
        "She said it's all right."<p></p>
        "Yay, I get to eat Mahiru's cooking!"<p></p>
        "That wasn't your goal all along, was it?"<p></p>
        "Let's just say I'm not one to waste an opportunity. Besides, you're always raving about<p></p>
        her cooking. I want to try it at least once."<p></p>
        "…Don't you dare be a nuisance to her."<p></p>
        "I may be a nuisance to you, but never to her."<p></p>
        "Don't annoy me, either."<p></p>
        Itsuki cackled, and Amane flicked him in the forehead. Though his friend yelped in<p></p>
        pain, he still wore a giddy smile, and Amane let out another overdrawn sigh.<p></p>
        "So how long are you planning on staying?"<p></p>
        Amane was looking at Itsuki, who had made himself comfortable the instant they'd<p></p>
        gotten the shopping through the door. Itsuki hadn't been coming over much lately<p></p>
        because Mahiru was always around, but before that, he'd visited Amane's apartment<p></p>
        often, and he obviously still felt right at home.<p></p>
        Itsuki crossed his legs and took a sip from his cup of coffee, staring off in thought. He<p></p>
        looked like a model in a photo shoot. "Hmm… Well, for now, why don't we say… three<p></p>
        days, give or take. Geez, this is a real pain!"<p></p>
        "Your dad's not a bad person, but he does seem to be pretty stuck in his ways."<p></p>
        "The old geezer's a stubborn ass."<p></p>
        "Come on—"<p></p>
        "I mean, what gives him the right to tell me who I can and can't date?! Whatever; I'm<p></p>
        moving out once I'm an adult anyway." Itsuki stuck out his tongue in a show of anger.<p></p>
        Amane knew that Itsuki didn't actually hate his father. His old man was the kind of guy<p></p>
        who had to have everything his way, sure, but once somebody won his affection, he<p></p>
        always treated them well. Amane thought he was a good person at least.<p></p>
        But Chitose had never obtained his approval. Amane thought that it probably had to<p></p>
        do with the fact that Itsuki's family was fairly well-to-do. Itsuki's father probably<p></p>
        wanted his son to date someone from the same social class. At the same time, Amane<p></p>
        wondered if maybe Itsuki's father just couldn't stand Chitose's unique personality.<p></p>
        Either way, it sounded like he had dismissed Itsuki's relationship without listening to<p></p>
        anything Itsuki had to say. So Itsuki had declared that, if that was the case, he was<p></p>
        leaving home.<p></p>
        "You've got it good when it comes to parents, Amane. They let you do whatever you<p></p>
        want."<p></p>
        "My parents are super close, so I guess they want their son to choose a partner he<p></p>
        likes."<p></p>
        "I am seriously jealous of your parents."<p></p>
        Itsuki's upbringing had been really strict, so perhaps it was only natural for him to be<p></p>
        going through a rebellious phase. Bleaching his hair and acting like nothing ever<p></p>
        bothered him were just other parts of his insurrection. Amane didn't think he was<p></p>
        really in a position to criticize.<p></p>
        "You say that, but I'm sure your parents can't be that bad."<p></p>
        "They might be decent people, but they're awful parents. I mean, you can't just try to<p></p>
        control your kids all the time, man. You gotta let 'em run free sometimes, 'cause if you<p></p>
        always try to keep 'em on a leash, they're gonna bite you one day."<p></p>
        "And you think you'd be okay, running wild all the time?"<p></p>
        "Maybe, if they'd let me do my own thing. But instead they slapped a collar on me and<p></p>
        put me in a cage, so all I can do is bare my fangs." Itsuki shrugged. "They've been alive<p></p>
        for how long? You'd think they would have learned better by now." He slurped down<p></p>
        the rest of his coffee in one go.<p></p>
        "Well, you can relax for a few days. I mean, we're on break, so we've got nothing but<p></p>
        time."<p></p>
        "Friends truly are life's greatest treasure…!"<p></p>
        "Don't cling to me like that; it's creepy."<p></p>
        "You wound me! I demand Lady Shiina's cooking as consolation!"<p></p>
        "As if you need an excuse to eat dinner…"<p></p>
        "Tee-hee!"<p></p>
        "Don't act like such a weirdo."<p></p>
        "How cruel, to wound me yet again! Oh, boo-hoo!"<p></p>
        Itsuki pantomimed wiping away tears, but his grin was wider than ever. Amane<p></p>
        watched him with exasperation but also a small sense of relief.<p></p>
        Itsuki had frequent battles with his father, but the fight this morning seemed to have<p></p>
        gotten to him more than usual. It was obvious that he'd been putting on a brave face<p></p>
        at school.<p></p>
        Amane was glad to see that his friend was feeling at least a bit better. Of course, he<p></p>
        didn't want to let on to Itsuki that he was worried about him, so he pretended to be<p></p>
        sour even as he secretly breathed a sigh of relief.<p></p>
        Mahiru came over to Amane's apartment sometime after sundown.<p></p>
        She arrived empty-handed, presumably because Amane had already acquired all the<p></p>
        ingredients she had requested.<p></p>
        Amane had given her advance warning that his friend would be there, so she didn't<p></p>
        seem put off by the sight of Itsuki making himself at home. In fact, Itsuki was the one<p></p>
        who seemed slightly flustered.<p></p>
        "It's been a while, Akazawa."<p></p>
        "Nice to see you after so long. Sorry to suddenly barge into your love nest… Ow, owww!<p></p>
        I get it; it was only a joke! Sorry to suddenly intrude; it must be awkward for you to<p></p>
        have some unfamiliar guy hanging around."<p></p>
        Amane had wordlessly stomped on Itsuki's foot, but even as he groaned in pain, he<p></p>
        wore an amiable grin.<p></p>
        "No, not at all," Mahiru replied. "It's fun to have such… lively people over."<p></p>
        "Well, don't expect any peace or quiet with this guy around," Amane added.<p></p>
        "You shouldn't say things like that," Mahiru scolded.<p></p>
        Amane held his tongue, but Itsuki was giving him a smug look, so he pinched him on<p></p>
        the side where Mahiru couldn't see. Unfortunately, Itsuki was in very good shape, so<p></p>
        there weren't many places where he could find purchase with his fingers.<p></p>
        "Well then, I'm going to go make dinner, so please relax."<p></p>
        Mahiru ignored the boys' squabbling, flashed her angelic smile, put on her apron, and<p></p>
        departed for the kitchen. She was obviously comfortable leaving their guest in Amane's<p></p>
        hands.<p></p>
        Itsuki stared at Mahiru's back as she went, still smiling smugly. "…You're close enough<p></p>
        to give her a key to your place, huh?"<p></p>
        "Shut up."<p></p>
        Mahiru had let herself in with her key, rather than buzzing over the intercom. Itsuki<p></p>
        had not failed to pick up on this sign of intimacy.<p></p>
        "And she told me 'Please relax' like she runs the place. Honestly, she's acting like she's<p></p>
        already your wife!"<p></p>
        "Do you want me to kick you out?"<p></p>
        "Okay, okay, I'm only kidding… is what I'd normally say, but you gotta understand how<p></p>
        this looks, my man!"<p></p>
        Amane tried to grab him by the scruff of the neck, but Itsuki twisted away. He scuttled<p></p>
        across the carpet and booted up Amane's video game console. Amane slid off the<p></p>
        couch and sat down next to him, making sure to give him a gentle knee in the back on<p></p>
        the way, and the two of them killed some time playing games.<p></p>
        Before too long, Amane started to hear the sound of Mahiru taking the dishes out. He<p></p>
        wasn't going to make her do everything, so he stood up and headed for the kitchen.<p></p>
        "Let me help. Can I take the dishes that are already plated?"<p></p>
        "Yes, thank you."<p></p>
        Amane took several plates piled with food out to the table. When he set them down,<p></p>
        he caught Itsuki staring at him, looking dumbfounded.<p></p>
        "…How should I put this…?"<p></p>
        "What's up?"<p></p>
        "Know what? I'll keep it to myself."<p></p>
        "What the heck…," Amane muttered as Itsuki started packing away the game console.<p></p>
        When it was time for dinner, the three of them sat down, with Mahiru's homemade<p></p>
        dishes between them, and Itsuki wore a truly pleased expression.<p></p>
        "So good…"<p></p>
        "Thank you very much."<p></p>
        Mahiru sat up straight and proper as she ate. She wore her calm, angelic smile, but<p></p>
        since Itsuki already knew their secret, Amane could tell that she was letting herself<p></p>
        relax a little.<p></p>
        Itsuki looked like he was in a trance, bringing bites of food to his mouth.<p></p>
        Amane had warned Mahiru ahead of time that Itsuki would eat more than he would,<p></p>
        so she had prepared large portions for him, but even so, he was putting it away pretty<p></p>
        quickly.<p></p>
        "Wow, you're a lucky man, Amane, to be able to eat food like this every day…"<p></p>
        "I'm all too aware of that. The food is delicious as always, by the way."<p></p>
        "…Thank you very much."<p></p>
        He gave Mahiru his reaction after sipping his miso soup.<p></p>
        Amane's lips curled into a smile as he savored the taste. He couldn't help but grin at<p></p>
        the comforting combination of dashi and miso. It was so good that he never got tired<p></p>
        of it, even having it every day. But the person who cooked it didn't seem to realize just<p></p>
        how sublime it was, so he always made sure to tell her.<p></p>
        The soup had a gentle flavor that reminded Amane of her personality. It warmed him<p></p>
        all the way down into his belly. He didn't find it at all surprising that Itsuki was<p></p>
        entranced.<p></p>
        "Ah, it's so good."<p></p>
        Today Mahiru had made Amane's favorite dish, rolled omelets, so he had an even<p></p>
        bigger appetite than usual. Of course Mahiru's food was so good that Amane always<p></p>
        went back for seconds, but even so, his appetite was an entirely different beast when<p></p>
        eggs were on the menu.<p></p>
        As he was smacking his lips at the rich, comforting dishes, Itsuki kept glancing over at<p></p>
        Amane and Mahiru. "…What a happy couple," he muttered.<p></p>
        "Did you say something?"<p></p>
        "Nope!" Itsuki shook his head. "Not a thing!" He returned his attention to his plate.<p></p>
        Amane decided not to question him any further. He noticed that Mahiru was staring<p></p>
        at him quietly and simply shrugged.<p></p>
        After dinner, Mahiru went home early.<p></p>
        Usually, she would stay at Amane's place until it was time to wind down, typically a bit<p></p>
        after nine o'clock, but because Itsuki was staying over, she had decided it was best to<p></p>
        leave a little sooner. The two of them had been left alone while Amane had done the<p></p>
        washing up, and he wondered if that awkwardness wasn't part of the reason she'd left<p></p>
        so soon.<p></p>
        When Amane asked Itsuki what they had talked about, he'd said that they'd just made<p></p>
        small talk and chatted about Chitose. Amane hadn't questioned his friend any further,<p></p>
        but he had a suspicion that other topics had come up.<p></p>
        "Hey, Amane?"<p></p>
        Just before going to sleep, Itsuki looked up from where he had spread out a futon on<p></p>
        the floor of the bedroom.<p></p>
        "What is it?" Amane asked from his bed.<p></p>
        "The way you look at Shiina, with those big soft eyes… You definitely have a thing for<p></p>
        her, right?"<p></p>
        "Shut up."<p></p>
        "Anybody can see it, man. You're absolutely lovestruck."<p></p>
        "Don't make me kick you out into the cold."<p></p>
        "Aw, c'mon."<p></p>
        Amane shot his friend a glare that dared him to keep going, but Itsuki did not look the<p></p>
        least bit discouraged. On the other hand, he wasn't wearing his usual cheeky grin,<p></p>
        either. Itsuki's expression looked genuinely happy—and even a little proud.<p></p>
        "Well, fine, I'm not expecting you to admit it. But I want you to know that I'm happy<p></p>
        for you, man. I'm happy that you found somebody who can appreciate you."<p></p>
        "Huh?"<p></p>
        "Geez, you really are dense. Look, most of the folks in our class probably think you're<p></p>
        a weird, gloomy loner."<p></p>
        "I'm perfectly aware of that, thank you very much."<p></p>
        Among his classmates, Amane had always been something of a plain, unsociable<p></p>
        character, the kind of boy who never really stood out or got noticed, despite his high<p></p>
        ranking on almost every exam.<p></p>
        Compared to guys like Itsuki, the sophisticated and cheerful gentleman, or Yuuta, the<p></p>
        fresh-faced prince, Amane might as well have been invisible. Not to mention that,<p></p>
        whether he knew it or not, Amane was always doing his hardest to not stand out or<p></p>
        make waves. Of course he wasn't popular.<p></p>
        "But they're only going by what they can see," Itsuki continued. "They don't know the<p></p>
        real you. And even the people who do get to know you have to look hard to see your<p></p>
        good parts."<p></p>
        Itsuki was staring at Amane without a hint of mockery in his eyes. His sudden<p></p>
        earnestness made Amane a little uncomfortable.<p></p>
        "It's such a waste that you don't know just what an awesome guy you are. That's why<p></p>
        I'm so happy that Shiina sees you for who you really are and gets along with you so<p></p>
        well."<p></p>
        "Itsuki…"<p></p>
        "So hurry up and start dating her, and let's go on a double date!"<p></p>
        "Geez, why does it always come back around to that?"<p></p>
        While he obviously couldn't pass up the opportunity to tease his friend, Amane<p></p>
        noticed that Itsuki wasn't looking directly at him. He was probably trying to hide his<p></p>
        embarrassment after getting all emotional. Amane figured Itsuki could stand to be offbalance for a change.<p>
        </p>
        "Chi would be happy, too, ya know," Itsuki added.<p></p>
        "By all means, you two go have the time of your lives. Just leave us out of it. I mean,<p></p>
        if—and this is entirely hypothetical—but if we did develop that sort of relationship,<p></p>
        would you really want to be seen with a guy who looks like I do?"<p></p>
        "No, we'd obviously get you to transform into the mystery man. Speaking of which,<p></p>
        you still haven't let me see it."<p></p>
        "Nope."<p></p>
        "Is it one of those things you only let Shiina see?"<p></p>
        "Itsuki, you have a choice. Either you can shut up and enjoy my hospitality or freeze to<p></p>
        death beneath the cold winter sky."<p></p>
        "Well, excuuuse me!"<p></p>
        Itsuki knelt on top of his futon and bowed in mock apology.<p></p>
        "Good grief," Amane muttered in an exasperated tone.<p></p>
        Itsuki must have still been scheming up ways to get his buddy a girlfriend to spice up<p></p>
        his life.<p></p>
        But there's no way I have any chance of dating Mahiru… right?<p></p>
        She already did so much for him. If the two of them really did start dating, he would<p></p>
        probably come to rely on her for absolutely everything. Forget how spoiled he was<p></p>
        now, dating Mahiru was a sure path to utter dependency.<p></p>
        And anyway, Mahiru didn't seem interested in guys.<p></p>
        She didn't have much of a problem being around Amane or Itsuki or even Amane's<p></p>
        father, but when it came to the other boys at school, she kept them all at a comfortable<p></p>
        distance, wearing her angel mask like thick armor.<p></p>
        Male classmates were constantly approaching her to confess their love, but he'd never<p></p>
        known Mahiru to date anyone, ever. It was like she didn't want anything to do with<p></p>
        boys.<p></p>
        And since Amane still wasn't sure exactly how he felt about Mahiru, he was in no hurry<p></p>
        to embarrass himself with a halfhearted confession. Plus, he was convinced that<p></p>
        Mahiru didn't have those kinds of feelings for him anyway. 3<p></p>
        Dating Mahiru would remain a distant fantasy.<p></p>
        "…But look, Shiina obviously really likes you. Step back and take a good look at your<p></p>
        situation before you dismiss it all as impossible." Itsuki spoke as if he had seen straight<p></p>
        through Amane's heart.<p></p>
        Amane just mumbled "…Easy for you to say…" and crawled under his comforter.<p></p>
        "Itsuki is so sneaky! I want to eat Mahirun's cooking, tooooo!"<p></p>
        The following day, Chitose called Amane on the phone at a ridiculously early hour.<p></p>
        Evidently, Itsuki had been in touch with her the night before. He had taken photos of<p></p>
        their dinner, like he had often seen many girls going, apparently for the purpose of<p></p>
        sending it to Chitose.<p></p>
        "Don't tell me. You've gotta ask Shiina."<p></p>
        "Okay, so if I get Mahirun to say it's okay, you'll share with me?"<p></p>
        "Uh, well—"<p></p>
        "Got it!" Chitose answered energetically. "Okay, I'm gonna go ask her!"<p></p>
        Then she hung up.<p></p>
        Amane had been holding the phone away from his ear because Chitose was so loud.<p></p>
        Now he made an exasperated face. As usual, he wasn't sure whether he should be<p></p>
        impressed or terrified by Chitose's energy.<p></p>
        Itsuki, who'd been watching the whole time, looked awfully pleased.<p></p>
        "Chi sounds pretty excited."<p></p>
        "Can't you do something about your girlfriend?"<p></p>
        "Pretty much impossible, man," Itsuki replied cheerfully. "When she sees something<p></p>
        she wants, Chi doesn't hold back. That's why I love her so much."<p></p>
        Amane figured that Itsuki's opinion was a little biased, on account of being in love and<p></p>
        all. There was a lot to be said for Chitose's abundant energy and the easy way she made<p></p>
        friends with almost everyone, and Amane was ready to admit that he often envied<p></p>
        those strengths that he so clearly lacked.<p></p>
        For the time being, he decided to heat up the leftovers from yesterday's dinner and<p></p>
        have them for breakfast. Silently, he thanked Mahiru for the food and for her future<p></p>
        patience dealing with Chitose's call.<p></p>
        "And so here I am!"<p></p>
        Chitose appeared, along with Mahiru, just before lunch. The two of them were carrying<p></p>
        shopping bags overflowing with food. Chitose was also wearing a backpack that looked<p></p>
        like it might be an overnight bag, and Mahiru was smiling ruefully. They'd obviously<p></p>
        met up earlier and gone shopping together. That explained why they were both<p></p>
        carrying bags and how Chitose had reached Amane's apartment.<p></p>
        "You got here pretty quick…," Amane remarked.<p></p>
        "I got all excited about the idea of staying over at Mahirun's place!"<p></p>
        "…Wait, what?"<p></p>
        "We are on spring vacation, so I figured, why not? And Mahirun said I could, so here I<p></p>
        am!"<p></p>
        Chitose grinned widely and looked at Mahiru for confirmation, and Mahiru nodded<p></p>
        with a smile.<p></p>
        She obviously had no choice.<p></p>
        Chitose must have strong-armed Mahiru into allowing her to stay over. But Mahiru<p></p>
        didn't seem particularly upset or anything, only somewhat bewildered by the sudden<p></p>
        development.<p></p>
        As Mahiru went to put the groceries away in the refrigerator, she leaned close to<p></p>
        Amane. "Don't worry about me. I told her it was okay," she reassured him in a whisper<p></p>
        so quiet that only he could hear.<p></p>
        Amane wore a worried smile as he watched Mahiru put the dinner ingredients in the<p></p>
        fridge.<p></p>
        "I'm looking forward to Mahirun's cooking!" Chitose beamed as she sat down next to<p></p>
        Itsuki and clung tightly to his side. Amane had lost his seat for the moment, so he<p></p>
        headed into the kitchen.<p></p>
        "Is there anything I can do to help?"<p></p>
        "…Amane, you know you can't cook."<p></p>
        She kept her voice down so it didn't carry into the living room and called him by his<p></p>
        first name. Amane smiled slightly.<p></p>
        "I could cut up vegetables or something? Actually, if you give me instructions, I could<p></p>
        do something simple. I showed you that I can actually make some things, didn't I?"<p></p>
        "…All right, I'll take the help. You really don't want to stay in the other room, do you?"<p></p>
        "Very perceptive. They're already flirting."<p></p>
        Amane shrugged and moved to the sink to wash his hands.<p></p>
        He knew he couldn't do much, but it wasn't like he was completely useless. He could<p></p>
        at least help Mahiru out with things like measuring and prep work, so he turned his<p></p>
        back on the lovebirds and their flirting for a while and became Mahiru's kitchen<p></p>
        assistant.<p></p>
        "By the way, what are we having for lunch today?"<p></p>
        "Omelets over rice, with green potage soup and a salad. Chitose said that she wanted<p></p>
        to eat the type of omelet that's half cooked inside when you cut it open with a knife."<p></p>
        "Nice."<p></p>
        "You really like egg dishes, don't you?"<p></p>
        "Eggs are great. Plus, yours are the most delicious, so I'm already looking forward to<p></p>
        it."<p></p>
        Mahiru's cooking never disappointed, and Amane was even more excited to hear they<p></p>
        were having eggs, his favorite. He still thought about the beef stew omelets they had<p></p>
        eaten that one time. He would have been happy eating those every day.<p></p>
        Amane silently lauded Chitose for her excellent menu request as he cheerfully<p></p>
        measured and washed four portions of rice. Gradually, he noticed that Mahiru was still<p></p>
        standing there, next to the refrigerator.<p></p>
        "…What's up?"<p></p>
        "…I appreciate the compliment, but don't catch me off guard like that."<p></p>
        "What do you mean?"<p></p>
        "It's fine if you didn't get it."<p></p>
        Mahiru abruptly turned away and began cutting up the ingredients for the soup,<p></p>
        leaving Amane standing there looking bewildered.<p></p>
        "I can't believe they can act like that and still not be dating."<p></p>
        "Seriously."<p></p>
        "Ah, that was sooo goood!"<p></p>
        Chitose finished the last of her lunch and patted her belly in utter satisfaction.<p></p>
        Mahiru smiled, glad that her efforts were so appreciated. Apparently, she rather liked<p></p>
        entertaining. The day's sudden appearances had evidently not been too trying.<p></p>
        "Wow, you really can make anything, huh, Shiina?" Itsuki gushed. "You were able to<p></p>
        prepare half-cooked omelets that kept their shape while still being so soft in the<p></p>
        middle."<p></p>
        "It's all thanks to my cooking teacher," Mahiru replied modestly.<p></p>
        "You studied cooking?" Chitose asked.<p></p>
        "Yes, sort of. Enough to take care of myself and to entertain guests when I need to."<p></p>
        "Whoa!" Chitose marveled. "That must have been one amazing teacher if you learned<p></p>
        to cook like this!"<p></p>
        Mahiru must have been talking about the maid she had mentioned to Amane before,<p></p>
        the only person in her parents' house who had treated her with any kindness.<p></p>
        "I wonder if I could get this good, if I had a teacher like that."<p></p>
        "Maybe if you were a little less… adventurous in the kitchen, you would have better<p></p>
        results," Itsuki suggested.<p></p>
        "Hey—what's the point if you don't experiment a little?!"<p></p>
        "Well, if you tried following a recipe for once, I'm sure you could make just about<p></p>
        anything."<p></p>
        It was true; Chitose would have made a really good cook if she ever stopped messing<p></p>
        around. But her lack of discipline really undermined her efforts.<p></p>
        Chitose's personality was like a cat's—she did whatever she fancied at the moment and<p></p>
        generally pursued things at her own speed. The problem was that she had basically<p></p>
        no self-control. She could force herself to focus for a while if she had to, but it was<p></p>
        obviously exhausting for her. Chitose just wasn't wired that way.<p></p>
        "And not just in the kitchen, either," Itsuki continued. "You could try bringing a little<p></p>
        composure to your everyday life. You've got a great role model right there, see?"<p></p>
        "Oh, I'm sure you'd just love me to become more like Mahirun, but I'm afraid you're<p></p>
        out of luck. Besides, it seems… uncomfortable."<p></p>
        "That's awfully rude to Shiina."<p></p>
        "Maybe. But you have to admit, Mahirun always seems so formal. Or maybe, like,<p></p>
        stifled?" Sometimes Chitose could be surprisingly perceptive. "The Mahirun we see at<p></p>
        school is pretty dull."<p></p>
        "…Is that really how I come off to others?" Mahiru murmured.<p></p>
        "Well… we are in different classes," Chitose answered, "so I'm no authority, but you<p></p>
        seem dull or… sort of like you're looking down on everything, from a distance, you<p></p>
        know? I mean, you're still nice to everyone, but I can tell you never let your guard<p></p>
        down."<p></p>
        Chitose's conjecture was right on target.<p></p>
        Mahiru certainly treated others with kindness and respect, but she also never let<p></p>
        anyone except for a very small number of people see behind her mask. By playing the<p></p>
        part of the gracious and upstanding young woman, she kept her true identity safe and<p></p>
        hidden.<p></p>
        Nobody knew that better than Mahiru, though. Amane watched her expression grow<p></p>
        cloudy. But Chitose threw an arm around her and smiled.<p></p>
        "Mahirun makes a super-cute face whenever I bring up this kinda personal stuff, so<p></p>
        you can tell that she's being honest, right? I like this version best!"<p></p>
        Chitose giggled and squeezed Mahiru tight. Mahiru looked embarrassed for a moment,<p></p>
        but then she hesitantly returned Chitose's embrace.<p></p>
        "You know, Mahirun," Chitose continued, "I think you should open up more. I mean,<p></p>
        you could have Amane totally spoil you, you know? And we know you can be super<p></p>
        sweet to people you like. So if you'd just use that to your advantage, you'd have them<p></p>
        eating out of your palm!"<p></p>
        "I will do no such thing!" Mahiru insisted.<p></p>
        "Ehhh?"<p></p>
        "…I'm not like that at all, Chitose," Mahiru muttered, turning away sharply.<p></p>
        "Oh reaaally?" Chitose replied, staring at Amane.<p></p>
        Of course Amane was not about to get involved in this discussion. Mahiru hadn't asked<p></p>
        him for help or anything, and he knew that she could fight her own battles.<p></p>
        That said, if she ever did happen to ask, Amane was ready and willing to do just about<p></p>
        anything her heart desired. He would help her shoulder any burden and support her<p></p>
        however he could. That would be too embarrassing to admit, though, so he tried to 1<p></p>
        maintain a neutral expression as he watched Chitose and Mahiru's exchange.<p></p>
        "Oh man, it's a feast for the eyes to watch two beautiful girls getting along, huh?"<p></p>
        "Your words, not mine."<p></p>
        Letting Itsuki's somewhat perverted remark pass by without comment, Amane<p></p>
        realized that Mahiru had found a friend of the same gender. He was glad she had<p></p>
        someone else she could be open with.<p></p>
        Chitose's sleepover naturally took place at Mahiru's place.<p></p>
        Amane had expected her to want to stay with Itsuki, but she had said that since he was<p></p>
        always staying over at her place, she was happy being with Mahiru, and the two of<p></p>
        them headed back to Mahiru's apartment after dinner.<p></p>
        Amane had already known that Itsuki and Chitose were very close, and that Itsuki<p></p>
        often spent the night at Chitose's house. There wasn't anything strange about it, but<p></p>
        for some reason, he suddenly felt embarrassed to be confronted with the fact that<p></p>
        Itsuki often slept at Chitose's place.<p></p>
        Itsuki whispered, "Whatcha imagining over there, gloomy boy?"<p></p>
        Amane stomped on his friend's foot. He was merciful enough not to stomp on his<p></p>
        pinkie toe.<p></p>
        "Listen, man, stomping on my feet isn't gonna hide your shame forever!" Itsuki<p></p>
        grumbled.<p></p>
        "It's your fault for being such a jerk," Amane muttered as he turned away.<p></p>
        It's not like he'd been trying to hurt him or anything—Itsuki obviously knew that.<p></p>
        Neither of them were actually angry over a little playful roughhousing between friends.<p></p>
        "Actually, I've been staying at her place a ton recently. It's started to become kind of<p></p>
        the new normal, you know?"<p></p>
        "Yeah, yeah, I get the picture. You can lay off already."<p></p>
        "I thought that kind of talk was standard between guys."<p></p>
        "It's not, and I can do without it."<p></p>
        Amane had no desire to hear the graphic details of his friend's romance, and he knew<p></p>
        that when the story was over, and he glared at Itsuki, Itsuki would cackle with laughter<p></p>
        and smile back at him cheerfully.<p></p>
        "You really are a herbivore, eh, Amane? Or is it just a lack of experience that's holding<p></p>
        you back?"<p></p>
        "I'll knock you on your ass."<p></p>
        "Well, I guess that's exactly why Shiina opened up to you in the first place, huh? She<p></p>
        probably wouldn't have gone anywhere near you if she knew you were on the prowl.<p></p>
        Good thing, too, huh?!"<p></p>
        Itsuki gave him a thumbs-up and a big grin. Amane shot him a bitter glare, the sort of<p></p>
        face he would never have shown Mahiru.<p></p>
        But it didn't seem to have the slightest effect on Itsuki, who merely laughed it off.<p></p>
        Amane was busy furiously scowling at his friend when his anger was interrupted by a<p></p>
        cheerful electronic tone from his smartphone—his text message alert. He stopped<p></p>
        glowering long enough to check the screen. The message was from Chitose.<p></p>
        Amane opened the messaging app, thinking that she must be asking about tomorrow's<p></p>
        plans, and saw that he had one message, and that it included a photograph.<p></p>
        "Look, look, Mahirun is sooo cute! FYI, I got her permission to send this."<p></p>
        There was just that one sentence and an attached photo. 2<p></p>
        The picture showed Mahiru sitting on top of a bed, holding the teddy bear that Amane<p></p>
        had given her propped up on her knees, with what looked like her bedroom in the<p></p>
        background. That was not what made Amane pause.<p></p>
        In the photo, Mahiru was wearing pajamas—specifically,
        <p></p>
        a flowing, long-sleeved, light-pink gown, otherwise known as a negligee.
        <p></p>
        She looked elegant and refined—and hypnotically feminine.
        <p></p>
        he had obviously just stepped out of the bath, and the skin<p></p>
        peeking from her sleeves and the open collar of her gown was still faintly flushed.<p></p>
        It was an incredibly suggestive image, even though nothing inappropriate was exposed.<p></p>
        She somehow looked modest and seductive at the same time.<p></p>
        And what drew his eyes more than anything else was Mahiru's expression. She wasn't<p></p>
        looking at the camera. Rather, her head hung slightly, and she kept her eyes downcast—<p></p>
        not enough to hide her face, but enough to give the impression of shyness.<p></p>
        The rosy spots on her cheeks were probably not just from the bath.<p></p>
        Mahiru's expression looked shy, but like she was yearning. It was way more enticing<p></p>
        than any expression he had ever seen before. But the teddy bear sitting in her lap also<p></p>
        made her look even more adorable than usual. It was just a photograph, but Amane<p></p>
        could feel his cheeks burning.<p></p>
        —That jerk!<p></p>
        What was Chitose trying to do, sending him a photo like this? Especially right before<p></p>
        bed? There was no way he was going to be able to sleep after seeing something like<p></p>
        that.<p></p>
        "Why are you blushing?" Itsuki inquired. "You looking at dirty pictures on your phone<p></p>
        or something?"<p></p>
        "Of course not!"<p></p>
        "Okay, then what are you looking at?"<p></p>
        Itsuki quickly peeked over his shoulder, and Amane had no time to hide the image. The<p></p>
        picture displayed on the screen was reflected in Itsuki's eyes, and he smiled knowingly.<p></p>
        "I see, I see. You really are one innocent boy, huh?"<p></p>
        "How about you go to sleep—forever?"<p></p>
        "Are you implying that you want me dead?"<p></p>
        "Should I say it directly?"<p></p>
        "That's awfully unkind of you. I mean, what man wouldn't get excited seeing an angel<p></p>
        like that? Though, I gotta say, Chi's still the cutest…"<p></p>
        "Stop going on about your girlfriend already, stupid."<p></p>
        Amane sighed in exasperation and brushed his hair back with his hand, and when he<p></p>
        did, he heard the clicking sound of a camera shutter.<p></p>
        "…Itsuki?"<p></p>
        "Nothing; just got a message from Chi telling me to take a picture of you to<p></p>
        commemorate the evening. Just a dumb little memento. Should be no problem, right?"<p></p>
        "I guess. As long as you're not planning to do anything with my photo…"<p></p>
        "Relax, it's not like anyone else will ever see it. And besides, there's a good reason for<p></p>
        it, I can assure you."<p></p>
        Amane regarded Itsuki with deep skepticism. He had no idea what that reason could<p></p>
        be. But Itsuki just smiled, looking particularly smug, and Amane let out a big sigh,<p></p>
        grumbling quietly to himself that there was no point in taking his photo.<p></p>
        Listening to his friend complain, Itsuki muttered in an even quieter voice, "This guy<p></p>
        really doesn't get it, does he?"<p></p>
        "…I'm exhausted…"<p></p>
        On the third day, Itsuki and Chitose's stay was finally over. The two of them had gone<p></p>
        back to Chitose's place, where Itsuki would spend another day or two. (Apparently<p></p>
        Chitose's parents would've been perfectly fine if he stayed forever, but all the same, he<p></p>
        didn't want to impose.) They'd eaten Mahiru's homemade lunch and left with big<p></p>
        smiles, but not before encouraging Amane and Mahiru to play nice in their absence.<p></p>
        Amane had figured that quipping back would have been more trouble than it was<p></p>
        worth, so he'd let their teasing slide.<p></p>
        "Aren't you tired, too, Mahiru?"<p></p>
        The two of them were sitting together on Amane's couch.<p></p>
        "…I'm wiped out. That was really hard. But it was also a lot of fun."<p></p>
        "Yeah?"<p></p>
        Mahiru wasn't the type to invite friends over to her apartment, at least for as long as<p></p>
        Amane had known her, so he thought it was great that Chitose had given her the excuse<p></p>
        to do just that.<p></p>
        It sounded like she sometimes hung out with Chitose when Amane wasn't around, so<p></p>
        if she had made a close friend, that couldn't be a bad thing.<p></p>
        "…Well, you know, I was really surprised when that photo was sent…"<p></p>
        "Ah, ah, oh that?"<p></p>
        When Mahiru said the word photo, Amane couldn't help but recall her elegant yet<p></p>
        risque getup from the night before. His cheeks were burning.<p></p>
        It wasn't like she had bared a lot of skin, but Amane could still remember the way her<p></p>
        nightgown had accentuated her soft curves. If anything, her modesty had only made<p></p>
        her more enticing. He'd already filed the image away in his mind for later, though he<p></p>
        felt surprisingly guilty about it.<p></p>
        "Y-yesterday," Mahiru explained, "yesterday, Chitose said 'You're so cute!' and took a<p></p>
        lot of photos. S-so, I'm not exactly sure which one she sent you. She was really insistent,<p></p>
        so I gave her my permission, but… I hope it wasn't anything too embarrassing…"<p></p>
        Apparently, Chitose hadn't shown Mahiru which photo she had sent. Amane figured<p></p>
        she'd sent him the best shot, but he wondered whether Mahiru was aware how she'd<p></p>
        looked—or even that Chitose had photographed that particular moment at all. He<p></p>
        wasn't sure how Mahiru would react if he showed her the picture. The photo wasn't<p></p>
        obscene or anything, and Mahiru definitely hadn't looked bad, but still, it could cause<p></p>
        a lot of trouble.<p></p>
        "Uh, ummm, well, it was… it was a picture of you with the teddy bear on your knees."<p></p>
        "…Th-the teddy bear…?"<p></p>
        "I guess you're taking good care of it, huh?"<p></p>
        Well, that part was true, at least.<p></p>
        Amane, still feeling guilty, decided the best thing to do was shove the image deep down<p></p>
        into the recesses of his memory. If he couldn't forget it, he could at least seal it away.<p></p>
        When Mahiru heard the word bear, she seemed to more or less recall the moment the<p></p>
        photo had been taken, and she smiled slightly.<p></p>
        "…I told you I was going to cherish it," she said, "because it's a precious gift."<p></p>
        Confronted with her warm gaze and soft, welcoming smile, Amane's breath caught in<p></p>
        his throat.<p></p>
        This smile was different from her usual angelic smile—it was honest and affectionate.<p></p>
        Amane felt hypnotized by her delicate beauty, like her soft sweetness was beckoning<p></p>
        him to wrap his arms around her and pull her close.<p></p>
        "…Uh, y-yeah, I guess you did," Amane stammered. "You must really like it, huh?"<p></p>
        "Of course I do," Mahiru replied. "You picked it out for me, after all." She smiled<p></p>
        earnestly. "You don't have to worry; I treat him well. Why, every day I pat him on the<p></p>
        head, and I hold him tight when I fall asleep, and—ummm… never mind. Forget I said<p></p>
        anything."<p></p>
        Amane could hardly believe he'd heard her right.<p></p>
        A beautiful girl like Mahiru sleeps with a stuffed teddy bear. That's unspeakably cute.<p></p>
        He recalled how angelic Mahiru looked when she was asleep. Just imagining the scene<p></p>
        made him blush.<p></p>
        Wearing that angelic sleeping face, she cuddles a stuffed bear while she slumbers.<p></p>
        Mahiru, this beautiful girl, goes to bed holding the teddy bear I gave her.<p></p>
        Mahiru had already turned bright red, all the way out to her ears. She grabbed him by<p></p>
        the arm. "P-please forget about that last part."<p></p>
        "Th-that's literally impossible."<p></p>
        "Ugh, I'm so embarrassed!"<p></p>
        Mahiru looked at him with tears forming in the corners of her eyes. This expression<p></p>
        was even more devastatingly cute than the last, but it was obvious that Mahiru didn't<p></p>
        realize it.<p></p>
        "Is it really that big a deal? I don't see what the problem is."<p></p>
        "It makes me seem like a little kid, doesn't it? Sleeping with a stuffed animal, I mean."<p></p>
        "N-no, I think it's really cute."<p></p>
        Mahiru turned away from Amane and buried her face in her favorite cushion. "You're<p></p>
        not helping…"<p></p>
        Amane felt awfully guilty for thinking that Mahiru looked cute when she was pouting,<p></p>
        but he couldn't help himself—he found it endearing.<p></p>
        What he wanted to do right then was reach out and stroke Mahiru's head, but he knew<p></p>
        that was a terrible idea, especially now, so he kept his hands to himself and only looked<p></p>
        over at Mahiru.<p></p>
        After a few moments had passed, she peeked out from behind the cushion. Her eyes<p></p>
        shimmered, and her face was flushed, but she composed herself enough to give him a<p></p>
        reproachful look.<p></p>
        "…Amane, you need to tell me something embarrassing, too. It's not fair if I'm the only<p></p>
        one."<p></p>
        "What…?"<p></p>
        Mahiru had done this to herself. Amane felt no responsibility to put himself in a similar<p></p>
        position. But he knew better than to say that.<p></p>
        On the other hand, he was having a hard time coming up with anything embarrassing<p></p>
        that she didn't already know.<p></p>
        "If you won't tell me something," Mahiru said sternly, "I'll just have to message<p></p>
        Akazawa and ask him."<p></p>
        "When did you exchange contact info with Itsuki…?"<p></p>
        "Actually, Chitose gave me his information, and we messaged back and forth…<p></p>
        yesterday, I think. But it wasn't about anything in particular… nothing you need to<p></p>
        worry about anyway…"<p></p>
        Mahiru trailed off and buried her face in the cushion again.<p></p>
        At this point, Amane really had no idea what was going on.<p></p>
        Chapter 24: An Incident and the Angel’s Truth<p></p>
        Spring vacation meant quite a lot of free time for those without any particularly<p></p>
        involved hobbies. It wasn't that Amane had no interests, he just preferred activities<p></p>
        like reading and taking long walks. On occasion, his classmates made fun of him for<p></p>
        being so dull.<p></p>
        But Amane wasn't interested in sports or outdoor games. Unless he had somewhere<p></p>
        to be, his trips outside were for running or walking, or to go buy groceries, and that<p></p>
        was about it. Itsuki had always wondered why Amane didn't appreciate his youth<p></p>
        more, but Amane figured he got enough exercise to stay healthy.<p></p>
        Mahiru also didn't seem to go out much. Of course, he sometimes saw her exercising,<p></p>
        and she often ventured outside to buy things she needed, but she didn't really go out<p></p>
        specifically to do anything recreational.<p></p>
        "Don't you want to go somewhere for fun?"<p></p>
        When he asked Mahiru about it one day after dinner, she looked troubled for a moment,<p></p>
        then smiled and answered, "Go somewhere for fun…? Not right now, no. I'm kind of a<p></p>
        homebody."<p></p>
        Amane wasn't one to talk, but he wondered whether it was healthy for a beautiful high<p></p>
        school girl to stay in all the time. "Well, I guess I'm the same way, huh? I don't really<p></p>
        feel like going out anywhere, either."<p></p>
        "…What about going back to your parents' house?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        "I saw them at New Year's, so I think I can take a pass. Plus, I'm supposed to be going<p></p>
        home this summer, too. And it would suck to miss out on your fantastic cooking."<p></p>
        "…I-is that so?"<p></p>
        Amane had definitely grown accustomed to enjoying Mahiru's cooking every day.<p></p>
        Spending so much time together seemed normal now. He appreciated Mahiru's<p></p>
        kindness and her beauty, and he felt calmer just being around her.<p></p>
        "Not to mention, if I go home, they'll just drag me around all over the place, and that<p></p>
        sounds exhausting."<p></p>
        "…Drag you around?"<p></p>
        "To resorts and shopping and stuff. If I don't have anything else to do, they take me<p></p>
        wherever they want to go. Once when I was in middle school, we even went to hot<p></p>
        spring resorts and stuff."<p></p>
        Amane's mother didn't really care whether they were spending time indoors or<p></p>
        outdoors—she could get excited about nearly anything as long as she was spending<p></p>
        time with family. Whenever Amane didn't have plans, she often tried to drag him with<p></p>
        her somewhere. She was usually kind enough to let him choose where they went, but<p></p>
        if he let her get away with it, she wouldn't hesitate to take advantage of him.<p></p>
        Amusement parks and shopping malls were charming enough, but Amane's mother<p></p>
        also enjoyed mountaineering and airsoft games, which were more intense. Amane had<p></p>
        never understood how she contained so much energy in her petite frame.<p></p>
        Thanks to his mother, Amane had learned how to do all sorts of things, and even stayed<p></p>
        in decent shape, but it was obvious that his own preference for quiet hobbies was<p></p>
        something of a reaction to his mother's riotous enthusiasm.<p></p>
        "…That sounds fun," Mahiru said.<p></p>
        "When it's every single day, you get tired of it pretty quick. I'd rather not start off a<p></p>
        new school year totally ragged after trying to keep up with her."<p></p>
        "Ha-ha, I can imagine."<p></p>
        "You'd understand if you came with me. Then she'd focus all her energy on you<p></p>
        instead."<p></p>
        "I s-suppose so…"<p></p>
        Amane was sure that his mother would be delighted to go out somewhere with<p></p>
        Mahiru. He didn't think she'd want to do anything too hardcore, but she would<p></p>
        definitely take her around shopping and stuff.<p></p>
        He knew that his mother had always wanted a daughter and would probably leap at<p></p>
        the chance to spend time with any girl right around this age, much less a girl like<p></p>
        Mahiru.<p></p>
        "You'll see, if you come to visit over the summer. She'll probably drag you all over the<p></p>
        place and treat you like a dress-up doll again."<p></p>
        "…Summer?"<p></p>
        "I have a feeling she's going to ask me to bring you home with me."<p></p>
        By which I mean she's actually already tried to pressure me into it.<p></p>
        As things stood, Shihoko was probably going to approach Mahiru directly by the time<p></p>
        summer vacation rolled around.<p></p>
        "Ah, well, if you hate the idea, feel free to decline."<p></p>
        "N-no, I don't hate it! If anything, I'm happy!"<p></p>
        Mahiru shook her head forcefully, and as her hair cascaded around her face, the scent<p></p>
        of her shampoo tickled Amane's nose.<p></p>
        "Mm. All right, I'll go ahead and tell Mom. I know she'll be happy to have you over."<p></p>
        "…Thank you."<p></p>
        "I should be the one thanking you for taking some of the burden."<p></p>
        "Oh, please." She slapped his upper arm gently.<p></p>
        Of course it didn't hurt, but Amane's heart started pounding the moment she touched<p></p>
        him.<p></p>
        "…Amane?"<p></p>
        "A-ah, nothing, it's nothing."<p></p>
        "You don't really look like it's nothing, but…"<p></p>
        "Honestly, don't worry about it. Oh, look at that. You got a message or something."<p></p>
        Amane was all too happy to change the subject. He pointed to Mahiru's phone. It was<p></p>
        vibrating and flashing a notification.<p></p>
        Thankfully, Mahiru shifted her attention to the phone. "What could this be?" she<p></p>
        muttered as she picked it up and opened the messaging application.<p></p>
        Of course Amane knew it would be rude to read over her shoulder, and he didn't<p></p>
        especially want to make eye contact with Mahiru at that exact moment, so he found<p></p>
        somewhere else to look, but… when he heard a soft thump, he looked back over to<p></p>
        Mahiru and froze.<p></p>
        Mahiru had dropped her phone onto the cushion on her knees and wore an expression<p></p>
        like a lost child, as if she was about to cry.<p></p>
        It wasn't just the tears collecting in her eyes or the odd twist in her mouth… She looked<p></p>
        like she might shatter if he so much as touched her.<p></p>
        Where have I seen this expression before?<p></p>
        Oh yeah, it reminds me of the first time we spoke.<p></p>
        "…Mahiru?"<p></p>
        "No, it's nothing. Please don't worry about it." Before Amane could even ask her what<p></p>
        was the matter, she answered in a rigid voice. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to be<p></p>
        getting home. I have some business to take care of tomorrow, so it seems I can't stay<p></p>
        for dinner. I'm sorry."<p></p>
        Mahiru did not give him the chance to argue. She quickly collected her things and left.<p></p>
        Amane moved to stop her, but she either didn't notice or deliberately ignored him. He<p></p>
        was left reaching out to empty air.<p></p>
        …Why, so suddenly?<p></p>
        He was certain that it must have had something to do with the message she'd received.<p></p>
        As far as Amane knew, there was only one thing that could make her look that way.<p></p>
        "…Mahiru's… parents."<p></p>
        Mahiru didn't give her contact information to very many people, so only a very limited<p></p>
        number of people knew her message app ID. There was Amane and his mother,<p></p>
        Chitose and Itsuki, and he had heard that a few of the girls in her class who could keep<p></p>
        a secret knew it as well. Aside from those people, he deduced that the only other<p></p>
        people who might know it were her parents.<p></p>
        He had to assume that the message had come from them.<p></p>
        And suddenly saying that she had business to take care of tomorrow, when she hadn't<p></p>
        mentioned anything the day before, must mean that Mahiru was probably going to<p></p>
        meet them. He knew she had a difficult relationship with her parents, which explained<p></p>
        the gloomy expression he saw just moments ago.<p></p>
        Well, he might have determined the source of Mahiru's consternation, but there wasn't<p></p>
        much he could do with that information.<p></p>
        "…Mahiru."<p></p>
        He had caught a glimpse of her face, crumpled and twisted, as she left. He hadn't said<p></p>
        anything. Feeling helpless, he quietly muttered her name, letting his fist fall to the<p></p>
        cushion that, until just a moment ago, she'd been holding.<p></p>
        The weather was bad that day.<p></p>
        Dark, heavy clouds blanketed the sky, and when Amane looked out the window, he<p></p>
        couldn't see a single ray of sunlight. If anything was going to come down from that sky,<p></p>
        it would be raindrops.<p></p>
        Perhaps that was the reason it was so chilly, despite the end of March quickly coming<p></p>
        up.<p></p>
        Amane turned on the heater and had a seat on the couch, but somehow he couldn't<p></p>
        compose himself. Without meaning to, his gaze kept drifting in the direction of<p></p>
        Mahiru's apartment.<p></p>
        Today must be the day that she's going to see her parents, huh?<p></p>
        She had already informed him that she wasn't going to make dinner tonight, probably<p></p>
        because she didn't want anyone to see her so emotional.<p></p>
        Just remembering what Mahiru looked like wearing such a hurt expression placed a<p></p>
        somber, disagreeable feeling in Amane's chest, like the dregs of something dark had<p></p>
        collected there.<p></p>
        He was so worried that he nearly sent her a text asking if she needed anything before<p></p>
        deciding against it. He was incredibly agitated, but looking around his room, he<p></p>
        realized there was nothing he could do, so for the moment, he decided to head to the<p></p>
        supermarket to secure dinner.<p></p>
        Even when he was out shopping, no matter what he did, Amane couldn't get the image<p></p>
        of Mahiru's sad expression out of his mind. He imagined how painful it must be for her<p></p>
        to have to meet her parents, if that was the kind of face she made.<p></p>
        She had looked like she was afraid, he thought, pressing his lips together. Amane tried<p></p>
        not to scowl, so that he wouldn't look like some crazy guy, but no matter what he tried,<p></p>
        he just couldn't cheer himself up.<p></p>
        Then he dropped a premade entre e into his shopping basket a little too roughly,<p></p>
        making it all slosh around, and felt even worse.<p></p>
        Sighing deeply the whole while, Amane paid for his things and slowly walked home<p></p>
        under the cloudy sky—and then, when he took the elevator to his floor, he got a strange<p></p>
        feeling. Just as he was about to step out into the hallway, Amane paused, lingering in<p></p>
        the shadows of the elevator.<p></p>
        There were two people standing in front of the door to Mahiru's apartment.<p></p>
        One of them was a girl with familiar flaxen hair—it was Mahiru.<p></p>
        And the other was a woman he had never seen before.<p></p>
        Even at that distance, he could tell that she was quite beautiful. And she was tall as<p></p>
        well, especially compared to the petite Mahiru—by Amane's estimate, she seemed<p></p>
        taller than the average man. But her body was undeniably feminine. He could see her<p></p>
        ample curves even under her fitted pantsuit and noted that she had an almost perfect<p></p>
        figure.<p></p>
        Her medium-length light-brown hair hung loosely down to her shoulders, and she<p></p>
        carried herself with unmistakable poise. Her eyes were framed precisely with eyeliner,<p></p>
        but Amane didn't think she needed any makeup to look bold and assertive. Even<p></p>
        standing facing Mahiru, her stern gaze showed no sign of softening.<p></p>
        She was quite a beauty, but her entire persona was incredibly intimidating. She looked<p></p>
        like an extremely capable woman who was impossible to approach under normal<p></p>
        circumstances.<p></p>
        Comparing her to the neat and tidy lily that was Mahiru, this woman was like a striking<p></p>
        rose. That's how different the two of them were in appearance and temperament.<p></p>
        "Really, you're such a wretched little girl! And you look just like him. There's nothing I<p></p>
        hate more."<p></p>
        Amane stared in disbelief as vicious words slithered past the woman's crimson-painted lips.
        <p></p>
        He was sure that this person was Mahiru's mother, but when she spoke<p></p>
        to Mahiru, it was with a voice full of scorn. He could hardly believe that Mahiru<p></p>
        endured such cruelty at the hands of her own parent.<p></p>
        "At least if you resembled me more it would be a little better… but you had to look like<p></p>
        him. Well, it is what it is. Once you graduate, I won't have to deal with you anymore, so<p></p>
        there's no point worrying about it now. We can send the necessary paperwork through<p></p>
        the mail like always."<p></p>
        "…Yes," Mahiru replied feebly.<p></p>
        The woman snorted and turned on her heel. "This is good-bye, then. And don't bother<p></p>
        me with pointless nonsense anymore."<p></p>
        She was heading for the elevator, so Amane didn't have much choice but to step out<p></p>
        into the hall. The woman glanced at him briefly as they passed each other but left<p></p>
        without saying another word.<p></p>
        Mahiru was still standing there, and when she recognized Amane, her face distorted<p></p>
        into a grimace.<p></p>
        "…Did you overhear?"<p></p>
        "Sorry."<p></p>
        He didn't lie. He apologized frankly.<p></p>
        Though he hadn't intended to eavesdrop, he hadn't dared come out of hiding while<p></p>
        they were talking. Plus, he hadn't wanted to abandon Mahiru in her current state.<p></p>
        "So that woman was—"<p></p>
        "…Sayo Shiina. My birth mother."<p></p>
        Recently, Mahiru had been acting a lot more affectionate, but right now she was far<p></p>
        stiffer than when they had first met, and when she spoke, her voice was stilted and<p></p>
        ragged.<p></p>
        "I'll just go ahead and say this," Mahiru continued before Amane could ask. "She's<p></p>
        always been like that, so I'm used to it." Her voice was distant and monotonous. "My<p></p>
        mother has hated me for as long as I can remember, and it's too late for that to change,<p></p>
        so please don't worry about it."<p></p>
        Stress, pain, heartbreak—Mahiru could not hide what she was feeling. Even Amane<p></p>
        could see through her brave facade. He didn't stop to think about it—quietly, he took<p></p>
        Mahiru's hand as she turned toward her apartment.<p></p>
        He fully believed that his instincts were right this time.<p></p>
        Because if he left her alone like this, it seemed likely that Mahiru's thoughts would<p></p>
        head in a bad direction.<p></p>
        She looked at him blankly, then gave him a feeble smile and tried to shake off his hand.<p></p>
        But Amane gripped more tightly, determined not to let go. He didn't squeeze too hard<p></p>
        but held her slender wrist firmly.<p></p>
        "We're sticking together," Amane declared in the kind of authoritative tone he would<p></p>
        normally never direct at Mahiru.<p></p>
        Her face twisted into an awkward smile.<p></p>
        "…Really, it's fine. You don't need to worry."<p></p>
        "Well, I want to be with you." 1<p></p>
        He knew he was being awfully presumptuous, but he didn't intend to back down now.<p></p>
        He stared at Mahiru, and eventually she flashed him an exhausted smile and stopped<p></p>
        trying to pull away.<p></p>
        That was good enough for Amane. He led Mahiru into his apartment and sat her down<p></p>
        on the sofa.<p></p>
        Smiling weakly, Mahiru looked like she would blow apart after one stiff breeze. Still<p></p>
        gripping her hand, Amane took a seat next to her, then let go of her wrist and placed<p></p>
        her palms in his.<p></p>
        Slowly, Mahiru seemed to relax a bit.<p></p>
        "…It's not the best story, but here goes."<p></p>
        After almost ten minutes had passed, Mahiru finally broke the silence.<p></p>
        "My parents didn't marry for love," she said quietly. "They keep the exact circumstances<p></p>
        a secret, but they only got married as part of a deal between the two families."<p></p>
        That kind of marriage, based on family interests rather than love and trust, was rarely<p></p>
        seen in modern Japan. It wasn't unheard of, but to Amane, it sounded like something<p></p>
        out of an old storybook. He knew that Mahiru came from an upper-class family, but…<p></p>
        even so, he almost found it difficult to believe.<p></p>
        "And so… the truth is, they never really wanted a child. I was simply the result of one<p></p>
        night's indiscretion. Unfortunately, after I was born, they had no choice but to support 2<p></p>
        me financially… but that's all. I don't think they ever had any intention of raising me."<p></p>
        "What do you mean by that?"<p></p>
        "…They rarely ever came home. Even when they did, they just used the house as a place 1<p></p>
        to stay briefly. When I was younger, I hardly ever saw their faces."<p></p>
        Mahiru's voice was quiet and taut. She looked utterly exhausted.<p></p>
        "I can't remember them ever doing anything parental. I was actually raised by our<p></p>
        housekeeper. Mother had many affairs and usually stayed with her lovers, and Father 1<p></p>
        was too devoted to his work to have any time for me. He probably had his own affairs<p></p>
        as well… Anyway, they gave me plenty of money and left me alone. They said they<p></p>
        didn't need a child in their lives. No matter how hard I tried, no matter what I did, they<p></p>
        never once looked my way."<p></p>
        Amane finally understood why Mahiru acted like an angel.<p></p>
        She had spent her entire life trying to convince her parents she was worthy of their<p></p>
        attention, even if only for a moment, by performing the role of the perfect child, and<p></p>
        now she didn't know how to stop being perfect. That or she felt like she had no choice<p></p>
        but to hide her feelings behind her angelic mask. Either way, Amane realized that the<p></p>
        angel persona had never been something Mahiru took up by choice.<p></p>
        "Ultimately, they never cared. Even though I grew up pretty, even though I got good<p></p>
        grades, even though I was good at sports, even though I could do housework… those<p></p>
        people never once looked my way. What a fool I was, trying so hard with nothing to<p></p>
        show for it."<p></p>
        Amane felt his chest tighten as he listened to her despair.<p></p>
        "And because of my inconvenient existence, they can't even get a divorce. Neither one<p></p>
        of them wants to be the one to leave. It would cause trouble both in their family life<p></p>
        and at work. They wouldn't be able to expect any support from my grandparents. So<p></p>
        they're waiting until I finish university. Once I'm independent, we won't see one<p></p>
        another anymore."<p></p>
        "That's…"<p></p>
        "When my mother told me to my face that she didn't want me… it was a shock. I felt so<p></p>
        lost. I sat out in the rain in a daze."<p></p>
        That was why Mahiru had been in the park all those months ago, Amane realized. She<p></p>
        had been wandering around in pain because of her mother's cruelty. She must have<p></p>
        felt like she didn't belong anywhere—that was why she had looked so anxious and<p></p>
        hopeless, like a lost child with no one to turn to for help. Not knowing what to do, she<p></p>
        had lingered there in the park, alone with her mother's hateful words.<p></p>
        As Amane imagined the scene, he felt the slight taste of iron spread through his mouth.<p></p>
        It occurred to him that he had been biting his lip when he recognized the taste of<p></p>
        blood. He was having trouble containing his outrage at this tragedy.<p></p>
        "…If I was going to be that much trouble, she could have just not had me."<p></p>
        Her tiny whisper struck him like a stake driven through his chest, pinning him in place.<p></p>
        He was so angry at her parents that he could hardly think. Because of their neglect,<p></p>
        Mahiru had grown up hiding her feelings, acting like she was strong while she silently<p></p>
        agonized behind her mask of angelic perfection. Amane wanted to shout at them, to<p></p>
        demand to know how they could treat her this way. But the people who had<p></p>
        abandoned Mahiru were not around.<p></p>
        And besides, Amane wasn't sure what he should actually do in this situation.<p></p>
        He was certainly furious at her awful parents, but he was also an outsider, and he<p></p>
        didn't think Mahiru would appreciate him poking his nose into her family business.<p></p>
        He might just end up making everything worse. When he considered that he might<p></p>
        only hurt Mahiru with his reckless words, he decided to hold his tongue.<p></p>
        But it seemed like Mahiru would dissolve into thin air if he left her like this—so Amane<p></p>
        took the blanket that was on the couch next to him and wrapped it around Mahiru's<p></p>
        shoulders. She looked surprised, but he pulled the blanket over her head and folded<p></p>
        her into his arms.<p></p>
        This was the first time the two of them had really embraced, and her body felt tentative<p></p>
        and fragile. He was almost afraid that she'd shatter if he squeezed just a little too hard.<p></p>
        But it occurred to Amane that the person in his arms had learned that she was<p></p>
        supposed to live without relying on anyone.<p></p>
        "Wha—? A-Amane…?"<p></p>
        "…I finally feel like I understand why you are the way you are."<p></p>
        "You mean why I'm so pathetic?"<p></p>
        "No… I mean how you'll try to endure any hardship—and why you never let your<p></p>
        guard down."<p></p>
        Mahiru had never been able to rely on anyone, but she had refused to let that break<p></p>
        her. The maid had provided what help she could, but she was only an employee, not<p></p>
        family. Mahiru had learned to persevere in life on her own, and she had obviously<p></p>
        gotten quite good at it.<p></p>
        "Look… I'm not going to interfere with your family situation," Amane said. "I know<p></p>
        better than to stick my nose into other people's business."<p></p>
        Amane was an outsider. There knew it was best to respect the depths when it came to<p></p>
        complicated family relationships. However, that was not the same as saying that he<p></p>
        wasn't going to support Mahiru.<p></p>
        "…But if you need to cry or anything, go right ahead. I'll even pretend like I can't see<p></p>
