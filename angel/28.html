        <p></p>"A picture frame?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        It wouldn't have been polite to scrutinize her room too closely, so Amane had only<p></p>
        taken a quick look around, and he didn't particularly remember there being one. It<p></p>
        sounded like it had been jumbled in with the rest of the stuff on her desk, judging by<p></p>
        her tone.<p></p>
        Amane searched his memory but had no recollection of a picture frame, so he figured<p></p>
        he had just missed it.<p></p>
        "No, I didn't see one, but… did something happen? Did I bump into it and break it, or<p></p>
        something?"<p></p>
        "N-no! A-as long as you didn't see it, that's fine… if you didn't see it."<p></p>
        Apparently, Mahiru had something displayed in a picture frame that he wasn't<p></p>
        supposed to see. Her obvious relief made him kind of wish he had. But it was a matter<p></p>
        of privacy, so he wasn't going to say that out loud.<p></p>
        Mahiru looked like a great weight had been lifted from her shoulders.<p></p>
        Amane scratched his cheek. "I tried not to look at your room too much, you know? All<p></p>
        I saw was the lineup of stuffed animals I gave you, and the teddy bear by your pillow<p></p>
        that you sleep with…"<p></p>
        "Forget you saw that!" Mahiru slapped Amane's arm softly.<p></p>
        "But you already told me about it…," Amane answered without thinking.<p></p>
        Mahiru glared at him. "Don't tell me I was hugging the stuffed animal while you were<p></p>
        there."<p></p>
        "…You were half asleep, and you demanded that I sleep there with you, which I wasn't<p></p>
        about to do, so instead, I brought you the bear to sleep with."<p></p>
        "Sleep there with me?!"<p></p>
        Mahiru looked shocked, like she couldn't believe her own words. Gradually, her whole<p></p>
        face turned red. 2<p></p>
        She must not want to believe she said something like that when she was half asleep…<p></p>
        "D-did I really say something like that?!"<p></p>
        "N-not only did you say it, you actually called my name and patted the space beside<p></p>
        you… like you were telling me to climb into the same bed…"<p></p>
        "Aaugh!"<p></p>
        Mahiru put her hands on her cheeks and made a pathetic noise. Her face was bright<p></p>
        red, and her eyes were wavering like she might cry.<p></p>
        "N-no way, I don't usually have such… thoughts! I just, um, I… felt relaxed since you<p></p>
        were around, so… it's not that I really had any untoward desires… it must have been<p></p>
        something like I wanted your b-body heat, that's it."<p></p>
        "What's that supposed to mean?"<p></p>
        "Please don't ask me anymore!"<p></p>
        It was truly rare for Mahiru to raise her voice, and she was breathing hard as she<p></p>
        sharply turned away.<p></p>
        For once, Amane was the calm one. "F-fine, I don't really understand why you're so<p></p>
        upset, but I'm not going to pry. Just be careful from now on. You were half asleep, but<p></p>
        I did more or less get your permission before I took you home. But if you hadn't woken<p></p>
        up, I was going to have to put you to bed in my room."<p></p>
        "…That would have been fine."<p></p>
        "What did you say?"<p></p>
        "Nothing."<p></p>
        Amane could tell that she had said something quietly, but he hadn't been able to make<p></p>
        out Mahiru's mumbling. It seemed like it wasn't meant for him to hear.<p></p>
        "Anyway, you've got to understand that no matter how much of a trusted friend I am,<p></p>
        I can't just let you sleep here. If you try it again, I'll have no choice but to use you as a<p></p>
        body pillow when I sleep, no joke."<p></p>
        Though he had just made quite a bold claim, Amane knew that he wouldn't get any<p></p>
        rest if something like that happened. He was just trying to warn Mahiru against being<p></p>
        so careless. There were a few people she really trusted, but he still thought she ought<p></p>
        to be more cautious, even around those companions.<p></p>
        In response to Amane's slightly critical tone, Mahiru blinked dramatically, then put on<p></p>
        a faint smile.<p></p>
        "Says the same Amane who fell asleep so easily in my lap. You've dozed off in my lap<p></p>
        twice now, you know?"<p></p>
        "Th-that's a different conversation. It's a completely different matter for a guy to fall<p></p>
        asleep in front of a member of the opposite sex than for a girl to do it. I wouldn't be in<p></p>
        any danger."<p></p>
        "…Even though you don't know for sure that I won't do anything?"<p></p>
        "Would you?"<p></p>
        "Let me think… Maybe I would take your picture or something, as a joke."<p></p>
        Amane grew weak as Mahiru looked at him smugly, as if to say, "What do you think<p></p>
        about that?" but Mahiru didn't seem to notice.<p></p>
        "…I wouldn't really care, but now I'm going to have to check your phone."<p></p>
        "And what if I saved it on the cloud before you realized, and then deleted it from my<p></p>
        phone?<p></p>
        "Stop talking about it. I'm starting to believe you might try and it's freaking me out. Also,<p></p>
        my 'doing something' and your 'doing something' are different matters, so seriously, be<p></p>
        more careful." Amane grabbed her shoulders and spoke soberly. "You're not<p></p>
        understanding me at all."<p></p>
        Mahiru looked surprised, but didn't pull away, and didn't avert her eyes, either. "I<p></p>
        understand perfectly well. It's fine."<p></p>
        "You really don't. Not even a little."<p></p>
        "How rude! I said I do. I think you're underestimating me."<p></p>
        "If you understood, you wouldn't be doing these things."<p></p>
        "…You still need work, Amane."<p></p>
        Amane frowned, not sure why she was getting so frustrated with him, but Mahiru just<p></p>
        sighed softly, slipped out of his grasp, and headed for the hallway.<p></p>
        In Mahiru's hand was the house key that she had come to collect, which she must have<p></p>
        grabbed without him noticing. He had left it on the tray on top of his shoe cubby in the<p></p>
        entryway of his apartment.<p></p>
        "You have some thinking to do, Amane," she said as she left his apartment.<p></p>
        Amane thought that she might just as well direct that line at herself. Holding his<p></p>
        forehead, he grumbled, "Which one of us doesn't understand?" 2<p></p>
        Chapter 48: : The Angel’s New Clothes<p></p>
        <section id="48"></section>
        Exams were over, and it was the middle of May.<p></p>
        The sun's gentle rays grew brighter as it created a springlike atmosphere. It was that<p></p>
        time of the year when it was starting to get uncomfortable to wear long sleeves.<p></p>
        May was supposed to be the time for a seasonal change of clothing, but the work of<p></p>
        pulling out his short-sleeved shirts and summer slacks was awfully troublesome, and<p></p>
        Amane had been putting it off.<p></p>
        Though the air conditioners in school were set to the perfect temperature, as soon as<p></p>
        he took a single step outside the classroom, or set off to and from school, he felt hot.<p></p>
        Eventually, Amane came to the decision that it was time to get his summer clothes out.<p></p>
        "It's getting to be the season when we'll want short sleeves, huh?" Mahiru asked. She'd<p></p>
        nodded in understanding as she watched him pull his summer clothes out of a<p></p>
        garment case that he stored in the back of his closet and threw them into the washing<p></p>
        machine to wear for tomorrow.<p></p>
        Incidentally, Mahiru was also still dressing in long sleeves and tights, in a way that<p></p>
        avoided exposing any unnecessary skin.<p></p>
        She had switched to wearing a sweater vest under her blazer, but looking at her all<p></p>
        covered up, Amane worried that she might be hot.<p></p>
        "The weather is changing, and I've been feeling a little sweaty. I'm thinking it's about<p></p>
        time for me to phase out my long sleeves, too. Today was really warm, wasn't it?"<p></p>
        "You never let your clothes get sloppy, eh, Mahiru? You button everything up properly,<p></p>
        and don't roll your sleeves up, and you usually have tights on…"<p></p>
        "People always stare at me when I let any skin show, and it really bothers me. I feel<p></p>
        compelled to dress that way… It's like a form of self-defense."<p></p>
        Mahiru was beautiful and had a very keen sense of style, so she was often troubled by<p></p>
        people's gawking.<p></p>
        No matter what, she attracted attention, and that often included inappropriate stares.<p></p>
        Amane wasn't unsympathetic to the fact that men were naturally inclined to look at<p></p>
        beautiful women, but he could tell that Mahiru hated to be ogled.<p></p>
        "I'm never sure how to dress for summer," she said. "Last year, I wore some really thin<p></p>
        black stockings, but they were still pretty warm."<p></p>
        "Seems like they would be. Girls have to wear more pieces of clothing than guys do,<p></p>
        which seems like it would be hot…"<p></p>
        "Well, I can put up with a little warmth if I'm doing it to protect myself, but… the issue<p></p>
        of overheating is a real problem."<p></p>
        Mahiru sighed and said she hated summer for that reason. Amane didn't know how<p></p>
        he should answer and ended up staying silent. Mahiru didn't seem to mind, and let her<p></p>
        gaze wander over to the washing machine.<p></p>
        "So you'll start wearing your summer clothes tomorrow?" she asked.<p></p>
        "Well, I was thinking it's about time to change. It's already this sweltering…"<p></p>
        "I see. I've also been considering it, but before I can go to school, I feel like I've got to<p></p>
        try everything on at least once to check the fit. I think my size hasn't changed, but just<p></p>
        in case…"<p></p>
        Mahiru seemed very concerned about maintaining her figure, and it didn't seem like<p></p>
        she would have let herself get out of shape.<p></p>
        Amane admired her strong willpower and discipline. He knew that he could never be<p></p>
        as strict with himself as Mahiru was with herself, but he wished that he too had an<p></p>
        ideal body that he could maintain. First, he would have to start by getting his ideal<p></p>
        body, though.<p></p>
        "I'd better try mine on, too, or it could be bad. I've gotten a little taller since starting<p></p>
        school, so if they don't fit, I'll have to buy new ones at the school store."<p></p>
        Amane had purchased his summer uniform before starting high school, so now that<p></p>
        he was in his second year, he was worried it might be a little short on him. It had been<p></p>
        fine during the summer of his first year, and he hadn't had any problems with his<p></p>
        winter uniform, but his clothes might have become a little bit too tight for him, even<p></p>
        though he'd initially bought them a bit larger.<p></p>
        He had grown more than five centimeters since starting high school, and there was a<p></p>
        good chance his summer clothes were too small.<p></p>
        Thinking he would try them on after the laundry was finished, Amane gazed over at<p></p>
        the washing machine, which was making a dull mechanical noise.<p></p>
        Mahiru looked up at him.<p></p>
        "…You're pretty tall, aren't you, Amane?"<p></p>
        "Well, I guess I'm a little taller than average."<p></p>
        Amane was about one head taller than Mahiru, who was still staring up at him.<p></p>
        Mahiru had a petite build, but that didn't mean she was particularly small; in fact, she<p></p>
        was average. Amane's eyeline was just a little higher than it had been when he had<p></p>
        first met her, which made him realize again that he had been growing.<p></p>
        Usually, he stood at a bit of a distance when talking to Mahiru, so as not to overtax her<p></p>
        neck, but recently, she had been standing much closer to him, enough to touch, and<p></p>
        he'd started to worry about her neck getting cramps.<p></p>
        Mahiru didn't seem to care about such things at the moment. She was scrutinizing<p></p>
        Amane and frowning slightly.<p></p>
        "…I do worry about you, though. You don't weigh very much, for how tall you are."<p></p>
        "That's why I'm exercising and training to put on more muscle," he replied. "More<p></p>
        importantly, why do you know how much I weigh, anyway?"<p></p>
        "Because I saw you weigh yourself on the scale by the sink when you woke up late one<p></p>
        weekend. I was the one who pushed you over to the sink, when you were half asleep."<p></p>
        There was nothing Amane could say to that, so he stayed quiet, but Mahiru looked at<p></p>
        him with exasperation in her eyes.<p></p>
        "It looks like you're working hard, and I see you putting in the effort, but you've got to<p></p>
        eat a little more after you exercise, Amane. You're thin, and it makes me worry. After<p></p>
        all, food is what builds the body, right? If you tell me ahead of time when you're going<p></p>
        to exercise, I can adjust the menu."<p></p>
        "I'm really making a lot of work for you, but… I'm grateful for the offer. And since we're<p></p>
        still on the topic, you're kind of thin yourself. Sometimes I worry you might break, so<p></p>
        you should eat more, too, please."<p></p>
        Of course, Amane was grateful; he never had to worry about meals thanks to Mahiru.<p></p>
        She was even gracious enough to prepare extra food to help with his weight training.<p></p>
        But he thought that Mahiru herself ought to eat more, too. He could tell she was<p></p>
        delicate even through her clothes, and occasionally when he touched her, she was so<p></p>
        thin that he was anxious he might break her. From what he had seen, she had never<p></p>
        been one to eat that much, which probably made it easier for her to manage her figure,<p></p>
        but it concerned him that she was so petite.<p></p>
        "You're super thin," he said, and grabbed her narrow waist, realizing just how lean her<p></p>
        body really was.<p></p>
        A high-pitched shriek came from Mahiru's mouth, and the sound interrupted any<p></p>
        further thoughts.<p></p>
        "…Ah, s-sorry," he fumbled.<p></p>
        "N-no, it's fine, it's okay," Mahiru said. "Just, if you touch a girl's belly too much… there<p></p>
        are girls who develop complexes about that stuff, okay?"<p></p>
        "I'm really sorry for touching you like that. It's sexual harassment to touch a girl's body<p></p>
        without asking, isn't it? I'm very, very sorry."<p></p>
        "Okay, you don't have to go that far…"<p></p>
        Although they were good friends, they were still the opposite sex, so naturally, Amane<p></p>
        was very careful about how he touched Mahiru.<p></p>
        But he had just touched her stomach—not her head, or her hand, or her shoulder, but<p></p>
        her stomach, a very personal location. He had gotten worked up about how thin she<p></p>
        was, but that was no excuse, and he immediately regretted touching her belly without<p></p>
        her permission.<p></p>
        "I don't really mind it that much, so calm down, Amane. And anyway, I don't suppose<p></p>
        you do things like that with anyone other than me?"<p></p>
        "I don't have this kind of back-and-forth with anyone other than you," he answered.<p></p>
        "Also, I hardly ever interact with any other girls. It's not like I would randomly touch a<p></p>
        girl I don't know that well."<p></p>
        The only other girl he might possibly touch would be Chitose. She was slim, a bit like<p></p>
        Mahiru, but it was more of a lean athleticism, different from Mahiru's petite delicacy.<p></p>
        Though he would never even really touch Chitose like that in the first place, aside from<p></p>
        occasionally, playfully bopping her on the head.<p></p>
        "Well, I'm glad to hear that," Mahiru nodded. She seemed satisfied with Amane's<p></p>
        answer. Then, maybe as payback, she leaned forward and pressed her palm against<p></p>
        Amane's stomach, touching him through his shirt.<p></p>
        He wasn't going to scold her, considering he had just done the same to her, but it<p></p>
        tickled, and he felt embarrassed about his body.<p></p>
        Compared to how he had been before Mahiru had improved his diet, he was healthier<p></p>
        now, but his body was still a far cry from his ideal muscular figure.<p></p>
        It had been quite a shock to hear that she was worried about him being too thin, so he<p></p>
        knew he needed to eat and exercise more to build muscle onto his frame.<p></p>
        "…Do you think I'd be better if I were a little stronger, Mahiru?"<p></p>
        "Strong is nice, but I think that at the end of the day, the most attractive type of body,<p></p>
        for either sex, is a healthy body. Also, this is my personal opinion as a girl, and I would<p></p>
        absolutely never want to force it on anyone else, but… when a girl is standing next to<p></p>
        a really skinny guy, there's a possibility that she will feel awkward, so maybe a medium<p></p>
        build is better than being all skin and bones."<p></p>
        "I see…"<p></p>
        "B-but you're not necessarily… I wouldn't go so far as to say you're too thin, okay,<p></p>
        Amane? But it would be healthier for you to eat a little more. You're not the type to<p></p>
        overeat, despite being a high school boy. Speaking of which, Amane, um, when it comes<p></p>
        to girls… do you like slim ones best?"<p></p>
        "It's rude to comment on girls' physiques," Amane answered immediately. It was<p></p>
        something he thought every guy was supposed to know.<p></p>
        Both his parents always told him, "If you say something, and it goes over poorly, prepare<p></p>
        to see blood," so Amane always avoided commenting on anybody's figure.<p></p>
        "Ah…" Mahiru sounded like she understood his flat assertion, and her gaze drifted off<p></p>
        into the distance. He figured that girls must have the same understanding.<p></p>
        "Well, I guess it's better to be on the slim side," Amane said. "But if you're too thin, it's<p></p>
        worrisome, because it can be bad for your health and might mean you're not getting<p></p>
        enough nutrients. It gives peace of mind to see that someone has the proper amount<p></p>
        of muscle and fat on them."<p></p>
        "…That sounds more like something a parent would say than something you'd hear<p></p>
        from a young man, don't you think?"<p></p>
        "You're one to talk."<p></p>
        "Fair enough, but…"<p></p>
        If anything, Mahiru was the one who had a motherly attitude sometimes. So Amane<p></p>
        didn't think she had any right to accuse him of having a "parental" gaze or whatever.<p></p>
        "Even if I'm not worried about you, I don't think there's any need for you to be on a<p></p>
        diet, Mahiru."<p></p>
        "Really?"<p></p>
        "Where could you possibly lose it from? You've got your ideal body, and now you're<p></p>
        trying to maintain it, right? It's not my place to say anything, but I think the best body<p></p>
        for you is one you feel confident about. And personally, I would worry if you got too<p></p>
        thin, so I'd like you to stay just as you are."<p></p>
        He would definitely be concerned if Mahiru, who was already quite thin, lost any more<p></p>
        weight. He wanted her to know that her figure was fine just as it was. If she wanted to<p></p>
        get any skinnier, he would have to stop her.<p></p>
        "I understand that it's difficult to maintain a certain figure, but I think it's more<p></p>
        important to be healthy."<p></p>
        "…Sure."<p></p>
        Almost in rhythm with Mahiru's nodding head, the washing machine continued<p></p>
        tumbling his laundry around with a loud rattle.<p></p>
        "Good morning."<p></p>
        The following morning, when Amane woke up, Mahiru was there in his apartment.<p></p>
        He turned around and looked behind him at the clock in his bedroom. It was time to<p></p>
        get up and ready for the day, not time to leave his apartment yet.<p></p>
        Mahiru had visited his apartment a handful of times in the morning before, but it was<p></p>
        something that generally didn't happen, so Amane's sleepy mind was confused.<p></p>
        "…Morning?"<p></p>
        Mahiru had a spare key, and he had told her she could come in as she pleased, but he<p></p>
        hadn't expected to encounter her so early in the day.<p></p>
        When, in his bewilderment, he returned her greeting with a questioning tone, Mahiru<p></p>
        put on a gentle smile.<p></p>
        "I know it might be rude for me to come over like this in the morning, but… I was<p></p>
        hoping I could get you to check something for me before I left home."<p></p>
        "Check something?"<p></p>
        At that point, he took a second look at Mahiru and realized that he could see a bit more<p></p>
        skin than usual.<p></p>
        "I changed my clothes. Does anything look off?"<p></p>
        "Ah, summer clothes… uhh, no, well—"<p></p>
        "Yes?"<p></p>
        "…I'm not sure having your legs bare… is a good idea."<p></p>
        Summer clothes meant short sleeves, but that wasn't what Amane was talking about.<p></p>
        When he looked down, he could see her pure, pale thighs peeking out from under her<p></p>
        skirt.<p></p>
        School uniforms featured longer skirts than most street clothes, and Mahiru usually<p></p>
        wore tights as well, so he hadn't gotten a good look at her bare legs before. In keeping<p></p>
        with school rules, Mahiru's new skirt was plenty long enough to keep everything<p></p>
        covered, but even so, her bare legs were now exposed to the air.<p></p>
        Amane was understandably flustered, and his eyes darted around nervously.<p></p>
        "Well, I was thinking that not many girls wear tights at school right now," Mahiru said.<p></p>
        "That's true, b-but I don't think it's right for y-you. It's no good."<p></p>
        "Is that because you can't handle seeing my bare legs?"<p></p>
        "Th-that's not it!" he protested. "It's more like, if you show them off, the other boys<p></p>
        will probably make a fuss and stare, so it's a bad idea, I think."<p></p>
        The day before, they'd had a whole conversation about Mahiru's black stockings.<p></p>
        Amane had never thought she would appear without them.<p></p>
        The pale expanse of her legs was too dazzling. He couldn't look right at them.<p></p>
        "You sure you're not going to stare, too, Amane?"<p></p>
        "Everything has a limit, you know!"<p></p>
        "But it's a fact that you saw my legs when I twisted my ankle, remember?"<p></p>
        "That was an emergency, and anyway, I was a perfect gentleman! I even covered your<p></p>
        lap with my blazer, didn't I?!"<p></p>
        Sure, he might have caught a peek at her legs when he'd knelt down beside her, but<p></p>
        he'd been careful to drape his blazer over her so that he couldn't see anything<p></p>
        untoward. He'd devoted all of his attention to treating her ankle so that he wouldn't<p></p>
        look anywhere inappropriate. Hence, he had honestly never ogled Mahiru's legs. Even<p></p>
        Amane knew better than that.<p></p>
        "Well, are you having any imprudent thoughts right now?"<p></p>
        "…No."<p></p>
        "The way you hesitated is a bit worrying."<p></p>
        "No!"<p></p>
        "Don't get all worked up. Sorry for teasing you too much. I've known from the start<p></p>
        that you weren't looking at me like that. You just don't know where you should be<p></p>
        directing your attention."<p></p>
        "If you knew that, then you shouldn't have felt the need to question me…"<p></p>
        "No, it was necessary for my own satisfaction. Making your heart pound is the most<p></p>
        important part, you see." 2<p></p>
        "So you did this just to give me a heart attack?"<p></p>
        Clearly, Mahiru had wanted to start the day with a bit of fun.<p></p>
        Amane looked at her grudgingly as he realized that he'd fallen for it, hook, line, and<p></p>
        sinker. Mahiru, the prankster, just stared back at him, grinning in her elegant way.<p></p>
        "Relax," she said. "I brought stockings with me, and I was planning to put them on."<p></p>
        "Unbelievable…" Amane groaned, knowing she was trying to get a rise out of him. Then<p></p>
        he decided to get a little bit of revenge and stared back into Mahiru's caramel-coloured<p></p>
        eyes that were twinkling happily.<p></p>
        "…So you don't mind me looking at you?"<p></p>
        "Huh?"<p></p>
        Mahiru stared at him in surprise.<p></p>
        Without breaking eye contact, Amane continued, "You went out of your way to come<p></p>
        show me your bare legs. That must mean you want me to look at them, right?"<p></p>
        "…That's, um, I don't really mind… if you see them—"<p></p>
        "You don't think it's a big deal…"<p></p>
        Mahiru seemed very confused. "That's not—it's not necessarily the case, though…"<p></p>
        Amane sighed softly. "Well then, don't show me. You should only do things like that for<p></p>
        people you want to look at you."<p></p>
        He wished she would put herself in his shoes and imagine what it was like for a guy to<p></p>
        see a new side of a girl he loved. But of course, he couldn't say anything like that. It<p></p>
        was only the start of the day, and already he was feeling exhausted.<p></p>
        Timidly, Mahiru tugged at the sleeve of Amane's pajamas. "…Wh-what if I said I came<p></p>
        to show you because I wanted to?" 5<p></p>
        Her quiet voice trembled bashfully as she looked up at him with watery eyes. This<p></p>
        time, Amane completely froze up.<p></p>
        "Because I wanted to see your reaction… But all you said was that it's no good," Mahiru<p></p>
        mumbled, looking a little dejected.<p></p>
        Amane shook his head frantically. "Th-that's because it's not. Look, how do I say this?<p></p>
        It's troublesome, like… I don't know where I'm supposed to be looking…"<p></p>
        "So you think bare legs don't suit me?"<p></p>
        Amane reluctantly looked down at Mahiru's outfit. She was dressed in a crisp, ironed<p></p>
        short-sleeved blouse and skirt. The outfit exuded her usual tidy elegance, while also<p></p>
        giving off a fresher image, and the buttons and ribbon on her shirt, done properly all<p></p>
        the way up to her neck, were a reminder of her serious nature.<p></p>
        Amane might have preferred it if it were a little harder to see all the angles and curves<p></p>
        of her figure, but these were her summer clothes, so there was nothing to be done<p></p>
        about it.<p></p>
        He looked her over once, trying as best he could not to let his eyes linger on her<p></p>
        perfect, slender legs, then slowly opened his mouth to speak, a little fraught.<p></p>
        "…You look very cute, and those clothes suit you, so please, go put on your stockings<p></p>
        immediately."<p></p>
        "Okay."<p></p>
        Mahiru must have been satisfied by these brief, carefully chosen words of praise<p></p>
        because she gave Amane a gentle, broad smile and nodded.<p></p>
        Momentarily struck speechless by that smile, Amane turned away before Mahiru<p></p>
        could notice, looking toward the bathroom sink.<p></p>
        "Don't come playing tricks on me like this again. I'm going to wash my face and change,<p></p>
        so while I do that, please sort your clothes out and get ready to leave," he said, speaking<p></p>
        somewhat more quickly than usual, and hurried into the bathroom.<p></p>
        Mahiru giggled softly behind his back.<p></p>
        Amane finished getting dressed for the day, and when he headed into the living room,<p></p>
        Mahiru was sitting quietly on the sofa waiting for him. She was fully covered, in black<p></p>
        stockings and a sweater vest. Amane wondered if what he'd seen earlier had even<p></p>
        been real.<p></p>
        He couldn't help but feel exhausted by the whole affair.<p></p>
        "…You know, if you'd shown me this look from the start, I would have been able to offer<p></p>
        you an honest opinion, without worrying about how my heart is going to hold up."<p></p>
        "How nice for you; you got a special treat." 1<p></p>
        Mahiru grinned shamelessly, which made him a little angry. He walked up to her and<p></p>
        pinched her cheek, but she still kept smiling happily.<p></p>
        "…Well then, I'm going to leave for school ahead of you," Mahiru said, standing up from<p></p>
        her seat after watching Amane devour the breakfast she'd prepared.<p></p>
        To get him back in a good mood, she had made a rolled omelet. Amane was fully aware<p></p>
        of her ploy, but couldn't help feeling better anyway and went with her to the door to<p></p>
        see her off.<p></p>
        They walked the same route to the same school, so it seemed a little ridiculous to leave<p></p>
        separately. Even so, there was no way they could arrive at school together, thus the<p></p>
        only other option was to stagger when they left.<p></p>
        "See you at school," Amane said. He was planning to wait long enough to avoid<p></p>
        suspicion, as always, but he noticed that Mahiru was wearing a somewhat dissatisfied<p></p>
        expression. He tilted his head questioningly. "What is it?"<p></p>
        "…Just wondering if there will ever come a day when we can walk together."<p></p>
        "The stares alone would kill me."<p></p>
        Recently, Amane had been seen interacting with Mahiru more and more often, and<p></p>
        their classmates seemed to have gotten used to it, to a certain degree. However, Amane<p></p>
        still received many jealous looks, and when it came to the students in other<p></p>
        classrooms, they often glared at him.<p></p>
        Amane was already fed up with being on the receiving end of their overly aggressive<p></p>
        stares, and if he and Mahiru started going to and from school together, the negative<p></p>
        attention was sure to increase to a level he had never yet experienced.<p></p>
        "I suppose that's to be expected," Mahiru sighed. "…Though we're just reaping what<p></p>
        we've sown, at this point. It's all so exhaustingly inconvenient."<p></p>
        "I imagine that having everyone at school make a big deal of you just walking with a<p></p>
        guy would be pretty unbearable for you, too, no?"<p></p>
        "Actually, I don't really care if anyone makes a big deal out of it, but I know it would<p></p>
        cause trouble for you. If it didn't bother you, I'd be more than happy to go together."<p></p>
        "…You're sure about that?"<p></p>
        "If our timing matches up, that is. It's a pain to go out of our way to stagger the times<p></p>
        we leave, and it's inefficient on days like this. Besides, isn't it more fun to walk to school<p></p>
        with someone you like?" 3<p></p>
        "That's true, but—"<p></p>
        "Isn't it? I guess reality doesn't always go the way we want it to."<p></p>
        After a big, exhausted yawn, Mahiru shook her head once and then transformed before<p></p>
        his eyes, putting on her usual elegant, angelic smile.<p></p>
        "All right, I'm off. I wanted to show you my new summer look first thing in the morning,<p></p>
        so I'm glad I was able to come do that," Mahiru said casually. She batted her eyes at<p></p>
        Amane, who was still frozen in place by her provocative statement.<p></p>
        "See you later," she said as she opened the front door. "Make sure not to be late, okay,<p></p>
        Amane?"<p></p>
        Mahiru slipped bashfully past the doorway and set off for school. Amane leaned his<p></p>
        head against the wall of the hallway for a little while, then decided he should go wash<p></p>
        his face again. He was seriously worried about what was to come.<p></p>
        Amane left his apartment late enough to give Mahiru a solid head start. When he<p></p>
        finally arrived at school, he was not surprised to see people gathered around her,<p></p>
        checking out her new outfit.<p></p>
        The temperature had been steadily rising, and it was definitely time for new clothes<p></p>
        to match the season. Plenty of students had already changed into short sleeves.<p></p>
        Even though Mahiru was wearing lighter summer clothing, she looked very prim and<p></p>
        proper in it. Though because of her gorgeous appearance, her change of outfit still<p></p>
        attracted more attention than usual.<p></p>
        On top of all that, Chitose had gotten to her seat and declared, "That hairstyle looks<p></p>
        like it's sooo warm!" and tied Mahiru's hair up in a ponytail for her. The unusual<p></p>
        hairstyle was drawing even more stares—with her hair up, the nape of Mahiru's neck<p></p>
        was visible.<p></p>
        Amane didn't like that much. Mahiru was obviously free to style her hair any way she 7<p></p>
        wished, but he couldn't help but feel upset that other people were staring at the girl<p></p>
        he loved.<p></p>
        …How can I think that way? She doesn't belong to me.<p></p>
        Amane glanced over at Mahiru again, practically seething with unwarranted jealousy.<p></p>
        He was starting to hate himself for it.<p></p>
        Itsuki peered at Amane with that strangely perceptive look of his. "Oh, are we feeling<p></p>
        a little out of sorts?" he asked slyly.<p></p>
        Amane brushed him off with feigned ignorance. "…Must be your imagination."<p></p>
        Then for some reason, Itsuki looked over at Mahiru and nodded like he understood<p></p>
        everything.<p></p>
        When he looked back at Amane, he was smiling, or rather grinning. Amane could feel<p></p>
        himself getting even more flustered.<p></p>
        Chapter 49: The Angel’s Gaze and Amane’s Struggle<p></p>
        <section id="49"></section>
        "Amane, pass it here!"<p></p>
        "But you've got terrible control!"<p></p>
        The school Sports Day was coming up next month, and the students were leisurely<p></p>
        enjoying gym class.<p></p>
        Remembering the previous Sports Day, Amane knew once the teams were announced<p></p>
        sometime next week, the whole school would start preparing for it, but for now, they<p></p>
        were still having regular gym classes.<p></p>
        Listening to the echo of the basketball club's squeaking shoes, Amane glared at Itsuki,<p></p>
        who had thrown the ball sloppily into the wall as a joke, and chased after the ball as it<p></p>
        rolled away.<p></p>
        They were playing basketball that day, and soon it would be time to practice their<p></p>
        shots. It sounded like they were going to have a game during the second half of class.<p></p>
        Amane wasn't particularly good at basketball, but he didn't mind tossing the ball into<p></p>
        the hoop a bit.<p></p>
        As Amane chased the old, brown basketball rolling slowly away from the wall, he shot<p></p>
        a quick glance across the net dividing the gym in two. On the other side, the girls' class<p></p>
        was playing badminton. The girls were supposed to have been outside, but due to a<p></p>
        sudden downpour, everyone was having gym inside the divided gymnasium.<p></p>
        The girls also seemed to be playing leisurely, and from time to time, Amane would<p></p>
        catch sight of one of them lightly batting the shuttlecock with their racket. He grabbed<p></p>
        the ball and jogged back.<p></p>
        He was careful not to even look in Mahiru's direction. He wanted to avoid any chance<p></p>
        of anybody noticing and accusing him of having a crush on the angel.<p></p>
        He did like her, but he knew it would be troubling for her to hear those sorts of rumors.<p></p>
        He also didn't want to let any unfamiliar classmates know about it, so he kept it a<p></p>
        secret.<p></p>
        "Stop throwing the ball off in weird directions," Amane said. "It'll be awkward if I have<p></p>
        to go get it from the girls' side."<p></p>
        Itsuki grinned foolishly. "Come on, don't be so sensitive."<p></p>
        Amane threw the ball with a little force at his friend's stomach, and Itsuki, who wasn't<p></p>
        particularly bad at sports, caught it without breaking his grin. With a long sigh, Amane<p></p>
        got a new ball from the ball hamper.<p></p>
        The members of the sports clubs were always in high spirits during these sorts of gym<p></p>
        classes. This time, it was the basketball club that was in their element, and they were<p></p>
        especially lively.<p></p>
        Amane didn't really like basketball, but he was surprisingly fond of shooting practice,<p></p>
        so he had been throwing the ball at the basket all class, to show the gym teacher that<p></p>
        he was taking it seriously.<p></p>
        He threw another ball. It arced through the air, rebounded off the backboard, and fell<p></p>
        through the center of the basket. Amane retrieved it with a slight feeling of satisfaction.<p></p>
        "You're good at this kind of thing," Itsuki observed. "Though whenever a game starts<p></p>
        up, you lose all your motivation, and then you're useless. You should try harder."<p></p>
        "Be quiet. You can't expect someone who's a natural-born introverted member of the<p></p>
        'go-home club' to put in a ton of effort in a basketball game. Obviously, the guys in the<p></p>
        sports clubs are going to be the ones actually playing."<p></p>
        "I guess so. Hey, I was just thinking, you ought to show that special someone how cool<p></p>
        you can be from time to time."<p></p>
        Amane knew exactly who Itsuki was referring to, but he wasn't going to just nod<p></p>
        obediently.<p></p>
        "I don't need you to worry about that," he said. "She already knows that I'm no good at<p></p>
        sports and that I'm very uncool."<p></p>
        "Why do you always have to turn it around like that?"<p></p>
        "You have to know by now that telling me to make an effort here is a losing proposition,<p></p>
        right?"<p></p>
        Amane looked at Itsuki, who seemed disinterested in the outcome, with a sour<p></p>
        expression, and was confronted with more cackling laughter.<p></p>
        "Come on now, this is your chance," Itsuki urged.<p></p>
        "It is not. Why don't you give it a try then, see how it goes?"<p></p>
        "Huh? No way, man. I'm not that good."<p></p>
        "Well then, where do you get off telling me what to do?"<p></p>
        Amane grabbed Itsuki under the chin and squeezed his cheeks with his fingers,<p></p>
        warning him not to casually demand things that he couldn't do himself.<p></p>
        "Sorry, sorry!" As he was laughing it off, Itsuki looked over to the other side of the net.<p></p>
        "But she is looking over here, though."<p></p>
        "Huh?"<p></p>
        Amane followed Itsuki's gaze and saw Mahiru, waiting her turn to play badminton,<p></p>
        looking in his direction. Staring, to be more accurate. She was definitely staring at<p></p>
        Amane.<p></p>
        She was probably just killing time by looking around, but Amane suddenly started<p></p>
        feeling uncomfortable, now that he knew he was being watched. He pursed his lips<p></p>
        awkwardly.<p></p>
        Itsuki mumbled, "Better try your best," like he was glad it wasn't his problem, and<p></p>
        pulled Amane along with him after the gym teacher's whistle sounded.<p></p>
        For the practice game in the second half, the class was divided into two teams, to play<p></p>
        against two different teams from another class.<p></p>
        Amane and Itsuki were playing in the second round, so to avoid getting in the way of<p></p>
        the rest of the players, they climbed up onto the stage at the end of the gym and took<p></p>
        a seat.<p></p>
        The two of them were watching the imposing figure of Yuuta, who was on the team<p></p>
        playing the first game. He was putting on a good show.<p></p>
        "How is Kadowaki keeping up against the actual basketball club…?"<p></p>
        Some of the players on the opposing team were in the basketball club, but Yuuta played<p></p>
        well enough to put them on equal footing. Even though Yuuta was an experienced<p></p>
        athlete, at the end of the day, he could not match them point for point. If it had just<p></p>
        been a matter of speed, the track star might have had an advantage, but when it came<p></p>
        to agility and handling, not to mention the coordination required to shoot the ball, the<p></p>
        members of the basketball club were able to show off their specialized skills.<p></p>
        Amane had expected the basketball club would have an advantage and that his<p></p>
        classmates would be entirely shut out, but Yuuta quickly disproved that prediction by<p></p>
        continuing to score points.<p></p>
        "Well, Yuuta's the product of an athletic family, after all," Itsuki said. "He just chose the<p></p>
        track club because he likes running, but he can play just about any sport at a high<p></p>
        level."<p></p>
        "How is he so strong?"<p></p>
        "Apparently, his mother was a sports trainer or something like that. I think he told me<p></p>
        that his older sisters are going into related occupations, too."<p></p>
        "So he's the result of a gifted education."<p></p>
        "Whoa! Watch Kadowaki, guys!"<p></p>
        "Block him, block him!"<p></p>
        "Don't let him get anywhere!"<p></p>
        "Are we sure he doesn't have some awful grudge against us?"<p></p>
        "If he finds a good opening, this is really gonna look bad for the basketball club!"<p></p>
        Amane was half-listening to the cries of the opposing team. He could also hear the girls<p></p>
        cheering Yuuta on from across the partition.<p></p>
        They seemed to have started their own tournament of badminton on the other side of<p></p>
        the gym, and the girls who weren't actively playing had come up to the net to watch<p></p>
        the game.<p></p>
        The other boys, as well, were understandably enthusiastic about Yuuta's performance.<p></p>
        Murmurs of admiration swept the crowd. For some reason, Itsuki slapped Amane on<p></p>
        the back.<p></p>
        In the end, their class was victorious in the first game. Amane jumped down from the<p></p>
        stage, marveling at his amazing friend.<p></p>
        Throwing on the team jersey he had been given, Amane stepped onto the court, not<p></p>
        bothering to hide his expression of irritation, and accidentally made eye contact with<p></p>
        Mahiru on the other side of the net.<p></p>
        She was wearing a faint smile, different from her usual gentle, angelic type. It was<p></p>
        Mahiru's real smile, the mellow one that she always showed him at home.<p></p>
        There was a tenderness to her gaze, as she waved her hand slightly and slowly<p></p>
        mouthed "Do your best!" at him.<p></p>
        She didn't say it out loud, but Amane imagined he could hear it, and it was too much<p></p>
        for him. He couldn't stand to look at her and turned away.<p></p>
        His mistake was turning to face Itsuki.<p></p>
        "Feeling fired up now?"<p></p>
        "Shut up," Amane snapped back desperately. He felt completely transparent when he<p></p>
        heard Itsuki laughing in an apparent effort to break the tension.<p></p>
        "…I'm gonna die…" Amane groaned, squatting down to catch his breath. He was playing<p></p>
        basketball seriously for the first time in a long time and pouring all his energy into it.<p></p>
        His heart was pounding violently.<p></p>
        Even though he had recently started to exercise a little more, he hadn't yet fully exerted<p></p>
        himself like this and hadn't ever done such a strenuous workout. Coupled with the<p></p>
        match, Amane was extremely exhausted.<p></p>
        Amane coughed and slowly tried to get his breath back, but his heart was pounding<p></p>
        away and showed no signs of calming down.<p></p>
        During the match, he had accidentally taken a dramatic fall, so his battered body ached<p></p>
        and his breathing was ragged. He was having a really hard time.<p></p>
        Even though he had tried not to overdo it, clearly, he'd gotten carried away.<p></p>
        I feel like I looked really pathetic out there.<p></p>
        He'd fallen right in front of Mahiru. He felt depressed thinking about seeing her<p></p>
        afterward in the classroom. Far from showing her how cool he could be, the only thing<p></p>
        he'd shown off was how much of a loser he was.<p></p>
        "Amaneee, you okay?" Itsuki asked, crouching down next to his friend to take a look at<p></p>
        him. He must have seen Amane squatting off to the side while the teams shook hands.<p></p>
        "…I'm fine, but I'm definitely gonna be sore tomorrow."<p></p>
        "Ha-ha, that's because you got a late start on exercising!"<p></p>
        Amane felt a quiet gratitude toward Itsuki, who was rubbing his sore back even as he<p></p>
        teased him. He took several deep breaths, and his heart started to calm down.<p></p>
        His body was burning hot, and it hurt where he had hit the floor, but Amane didn't<p></p>
        regret playing this hard. He figured that pushing himself from time to time was a good<p></p>
        thing, even if it wasn't in his nature.<p></p>
        Amane sucked in one more big breath and decided to go cool off for a bit.<p></p>
        After gym class was over, Amane changed clothes and washed his face in the locker<p></p>
        room.<p></p>
        Lunch period was next, and everyone else headed out as soon as they finished<p></p>
        changing, complaining about being hungry, so Amane was left with a moment of<p></p>
        silence.<p></p>
        He had planned to meet Itsuki and the others in the cafeteria, but he felt awkward<p></p>
        about facing Mahiru at the moment, so he spent a long time trying to cool his face off<p></p>
        with the water. He may have gotten carried away, soaking himself all the way up to his<p></p>
        hair, but he was all damp with sweat anyway, and that was probably exactly what he<p></p>
        needed to rinse it away.<p></p>
        I can't believe I fell right in front of her.<p></p>
        Of all the places he could have fallen, he had done it dramatically, right where Mahiru<p></p>
        was standing—he remembered her expression when it happened.<p></p>
        Amane was scowling when he heard quiet footsteps approach from behind.<p></p>
        "Are you all right?"<p></p>
        It was a familiar voice, but one he would rather not have heard now. Amane slowly<p></p>
        stopped splashing his face and looked up.<p></p>
        He didn't want her to see his pitiful expression, so he bit his lip and took a deep breath.<p></p>
        Somehow resisting the urge to run away in shame, Amane combed back his wet,<p></p>
        clinging hair and turned around.<p></p>
        "What's wrong?" he asked, pretending to be calm. "You're still hanging around here?<p></p>
        Not eating lunch?"<p></p>
        He could see that for some reason, Mahiru seemed agitated.<p></p>
        "Oh, no, it's just… you fell, so I was worried if you were okay… Akazawa told me you<p></p>
        were here, so—"<p></p>
        "That Itsuki… You really don't need to worry; I just banged myself up a little bit, that's<p></p>
        all."<p></p>
        Mahiru was avoiding making eye contact as she spoke to him, and Amane got the<p></p>
        feeling that her angel mask was about to peel off, though he wasn't sure why. It was<p></p>
        perplexing.<p></p>
        She had appeared upset when he'd taken his fall in front of her, but this seemed to be<p></p>
        a different sort of agitation.<p></p>
        He tilted his head quizzically. "Shiina?"<p></p>
        "…No, it's nothing, so don't worry about it. Also, Fujimiya, that sort of behavior is<p></p>
        against the rules, so please don't do it again."<p></p>
        "What are you talking about?"<p></p>
        "Anyway, it's not allowed."<p></p>
        Once in a while, Mahiru would say something that Amane just didn't understand, and<p></p>
        this time, he was especially puzzled. Mahiru cleared her throat without answering his<p></p>
        question, pulled herself together, and stared straight at Amane.<p></p>
        "…Earlier, you were protecting us, weren't you?"<p></p>
        "You just happened to be standing there, that's all. I would have taken the hit even if it<p></p>
        hadn't been you that was there."<p></p>
        Earlier, in gym class, the girls had been poking their heads through the net that roughly<p></p>
        divided the gymnasium, so that they could better cheer on the boys. A stray ball had<p></p>
        flown perilously close to where the girls had been standing.<p></p>
        Amane had only fallen because he had just barely managed to block the ball that was<p></p>
        flying toward the opening in the net.<p></p>
        Be that as it may, he wanted absolutely no thanks for it, and he would have been<p></p>
        grateful, though bruised, if she had just let it go.<p></p>
        "It was nobody's fault but my own, so you can laugh at me if you want."<p></p>
        "That would be entirely impossible. I'm really grateful. But… that said, I wish you<p></p>
        wouldn't do such rash things."<p></p>
        "I couldn't help it."<p></p>
        Amane looked away as he dried his face with a towel. When he finished, Mahiru was<p></p>
        looking up at him with an exasperated expression.<p></p>
        "…You looked cool out there, but once we get home, let me take a good look at where<p></p>
        you fell, okay Amane?"<p></p>
        She spoke in a quiet voice that only Amane, standing at this distance, could have heard.<p></p>
        She sounded insistent, like she wasn't going to let him get away without an<p></p>
        examination. In response, Amane averted his eyes without agreeing and grumbled,<p></p>
        "I'll do no such thing."<p></p>
        Despite his attempts at protesting, when they got home, Mahiru forcibly removed his<p></p>
        shirt to tend to his injuries.<p></p>
        After she was done, Amane realized that Mahiru had coerced him into getting half<p></p>
        naked. He blushed bright red and wasn't able to make eye contact with her for a while.<p></p>
        Chapter 50: The Angel Drops a Bomb<p></p>
        <section id="50"></section>
        Exams were returned and results announced, and Amane and the other second-year<p></p>
        students reached a period of relative calm. Club activities resumed, and all they had to<p></p>
        do was prepare for Sports Day, the next upcoming event, in about three weeks' time.<p></p>
        Some students, depending on their scores, had to take supplementary lessons, as well<p></p>
        as supplementary exams for certain subjects. But Amane was in the clear, so during<p></p>
        this brief period of calm, he spent his time taking it easy.<p></p>
        Talking with Yuuta after school, Amane got a strained smile from his friend when he<p></p>
        brought the topic up.<p></p>
        "I don't actually have much down time, though," Yuuta said. "I've got club activities,<p></p>
        and I have to practice for the interscholastic athletics competition."<p></p>
        Yuuta had already become known as the ace of the track and field club in his first year,<p></p>
        and the coaches and managers had more expectations of him. He never failed to put<p></p>
        in the effort to live up to those.<p></p>
        Yuuta had once called Amane "stoic," but from Amane's perspective, that word<p></p>
        described Yuuta more than him. It was probably exactly that earnest effort that made<p></p>
        him so popular and well-liked.<p></p>
        "Oh, that's right, it's still a ways off, but the chance to show off your accomplishments<p></p>
        is coming up, huh?"<p></p>
        "Mmm. With the competitions approaching, I'm gonna need to shorten my times more,<p></p>
        but I don't mind since I like to run anyway."<p></p>
        "Will you be all right? My image of the track club is that it's pretty demanding."<p></p>
        "Maybe it is, but it's not like the club is ancient Sparta or anything. The coach knows<p></p>
        you can't get good results just by going all out every day. There's a balance to it: We<p></p>
        rest during break times, and when it's time for club activities, we work hard."<p></p>
        "Huh… sounds like it's definitely an enthusiastic club."<p></p>
        "I think it does require discipline and motivation, but if it was one of those high-energy<p></p>
        clubs with no time to rest, I probably would have quit already. If I'm just running, I can<p></p>
        do that anywhere. That's probably why Shirakawa quit."<p></p>
        "…Oh yeah, she went to the same middle school as you and Itsuki, right?"<p></p>
        "Yeah, she did. Itsuki and Shirakawa are both so different now compared to back then,<p></p>
        you'd probably be shocked."<p></p>
        Now that Yuuta mentioned it, Amane remembered hearing that Chitose's personality<p></p>
        was quite different than it had been in middle school. He hadn't known any of them at<p></p>
        that time, so it was difficult for him to imagine.<p></p>
        The only version of Itsuki and Chitose that he knew was the cheerful couple and<p></p>
        constant life of the party.<p></p>
        Their past didn't seem like a topic that they liked to discuss much, so Amane hadn't<p></p>
        probed deeply, but they must have changed considerably if it was enough for Yuuta to<p></p>
        mention.<p></p>
        Amane was curious. But on the other hand, with an expression that said he was<p></p>
        worried about upsetting Itsuki and Chitose by saying too much, Yuuta related gently,<p></p>
        "I'm not going to talk about it, but maybe they'll tell you themselves sometime."<p></p>
        Amane had no intention of forcing the information out of him, so he nodded with<p></p>
        understanding. Itsuki didn't butt into Amane's personal life, so Amane decided he<p></p>
        wouldn't go sticking his fingers into his friends' pasts, either.<p></p>
        "Going back to the topic of track and field, getting too obsessed and running<p></p>
        mindlessly only leads to injuring your muscles and tendons. For me, you know,<p></p>
        running track is important, but it's not everything in life. So I'm pretty happy with the<p></p>
        way the club does it."<p></p>
        His smile was so dazzling that Amane had to squint to look at him. Looking a little<p></p>
        embarrassed, Yuuta made an awkward face.<p></p>
        "Well, that's enough about me, right?" he said. "Let's forget about club activities for<p></p>
        now; we've got the day off."<p></p>
        "You're the one who brought it up."<p></p>
        "That's true, so all the more reason to put a pin in that. Come on, let's go home."<p></p>
        Amane laughed quietly at Yuuta, who was clearly trying to change the subject, and the<p></p>
        two of them left the classroom.<p></p>
        Itsuki and Chitose happened to not have any supplemental lessons that day and had<p></p>
        apparently left earlier to go on a date. It worked out that club activities were off for<p></p>
        the day as well, so Amane wanted to seize the chance to hang out with Yuuta. While<p></p>
        chatting casually after school for a bit, they'd decided to stop somewhere on the way<p></p>
        back home.<p></p>
        As they walked down the hallway, Amane spotted a familiar flash of gold farther down<p></p>
        the hall. He looked again, thinking to himself that it would be unusual for her to still<p></p>
        be at school, and saw that for some reason, she was holding a large quantity of<p></p>
        printouts in both arms.<p></p>
        "…What are you up to, Shiina?"<p></p>
        "Oh, Fujimiya and Kadowaki! It's unusual to see you still here at this time. Especially<p></p>
        you, Fujimiya."<p></p>
        "I could say that right back at you… What's up with those?"<p></p>
        Amane pointed at the printouts that she was struggling to hold with both hands, and<p></p>
        gave a small, wry smile.<p></p>
        "The teachers asked for students who had time to help staple together printouts for<p></p>
        next month's Sports Day. I couldn't say no… they just gave them to me."<p></p>
        "…You don't feel like you're being exploited for free labor?"<p></p>
        For better or worse, the teachers depended on Mahiru as much as the other students.<p></p>
        Amane had witnessed her getting constantly saddled with odd jobs, and this seemed<p></p>
        like one of them.<p></p>
        Mahiru was a prodigy who did well in school and at sports, but she wasn't a member<p></p>
        of any school clubs, so she was often given work from teachers who thought she had<p></p>
        an abundance of free time. They probably knew she could never turn down a favor<p></p>
        due to her kind nature.<p></p>
        "I do have time to spare, so… I'll be done with this pretty quickly. This is the last bunch<p></p>
        that I'm taking to an empty classroom, and once I've carried it all over, I just have to<p></p>
        staple them, and then I'm done."<p></p>
        "What does the school have secretaries for, then?"<p></p>
        "Well… it's fine. Despite what it looks like, I'll be done in a little over an hour."<p></p>
        "But you're talking about voluntarily giving up over an hour of your own time!"<p></p>
        Amane had some complicated feelings about Mahiru being a model student and<p></p>
        getting exploited by the teachers in situations like this. But Mahiru either didn't mind<p></p>
        or was just used to it, so Amane relaxed and gave her a weak smile.<p></p>
        "Anyway, that's why I wanted to let you know I'm going to be a little late getting home<p></p>
        today, by about an hour or so. But the sun has been setting later, too, so I'll be fine."<p></p>
        Mahiru said this like it was nothing, and Amane sighed softly.<p></p>
        "…Sorry, Kadowaki, could we push today's hangout to another day?'<p></p>
        "What a coincidence, I was just thinking that."<p></p>
        It seemed the two had been thinking the same thing.<p></p>
        Amane and Yuuta looked at each other and smiled, then casually grabbed the printouts<p></p>
        from Mahiru's hands.<p></p>
        Mahiru must not have been expecting it. She blinked several times, stunned, and<p></p>
        seemed to take a minute to understand what had happened. Then, she grabbed<p></p>
        Amane's sleeve in a panic.<p></p>
        "F-Fujimiya, give those back!"<p></p>
        "Where are you taking them?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        "Umm, to an open classroom on the second floor… but that's not the point!" she<p></p>
        insisted. "I was asked to do this."<p></p>
        "It's not like they have anything confidential written on them, since they gave them to<p></p>
        a student," he said. "And anyway, they didn't say you couldn't have help, did they?"<p></p>
        "Th-that's true, but… say something, please, Kadowaki!"<p></p>
        "Ah-ha-ha! Fujimiya, you can't do that," Yuuta mock-scolded. "You have to let me carry<p></p>
        half."<p></p>
        "Here ya go."<p></p>
        Smiling at Mahiru's grumpy look, Amane handed half of the papers to Kadowaki.<p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to realize that it was pointless to protest any further.<p></p>
        Amane could feel her reproachful eyes on him but let her gaze slide right off as he<p></p>
        headed for the classroom she had indicated.<p></p>
        "…I didn't mean to steal your time from you," Mahiru muttered.<p></p>
        "Nobody's stealing my time. I'm using it as I please."<p></p>
        Amane was doing it completely voluntarily. There was an argument to be made that<p></p>
        he felt compelled to do her this favor, but it was better than Mahiru toiling away alone.<p></p>
        Yuuta was smiling calmly and seemed to agree, so she ultimately gave up on saying<p></p>
        anything else. She glared at Amane with a tiny bit of resentment, which he pretended<p></p>
        not to notice.<p></p>
        Despite it all, Mahiru didn't stop them. He figured she probably just didn't know how<p></p>
        to respond to the favor.<p></p>
        "…You dummy."<p></p>
        She insulted him outright in an adorable way that he had never seen her do at school<p></p>
        before. Both Amane and Yuuta burst into laughter.<p></p>
        Mahiru, whose angel mask had slipped off a little bit, narrowed her eyes as she walked<p></p>
        beside the boys—<p></p>
        "So not only does she curry favor with the teachers, she's flirting with boys, too. All<p></p>
        while telling us that she's got an 'important person' or whatever."<p></p>
        "Seriously. She's such a suck-up."<p></p>
        Amane heard voices from somewhere, and he felt his body stiffen as he walked. He<p></p>
        glanced around but couldn't see any girls who might have been the voices' owners. He<p></p>
        decided they were probably somewhere behind him.<p></p>
        Beside him, Yuuta's smile didn't change, but the look in his eyes was serious. Amane<p></p>
        remembered him confessing once that he absolutely hated people who spread gossip,<p></p>
        so it didn't seem like he would be able to forgive what they just heard.<p></p>
        Even Amane was on the verge of saying something, but he knew that would just make<p></p>
        things worse, so he kept his mouth shut and peered over at Mahiru.<p></p>
        Mahiru didn't seem to think anything of it and had on her usual calm expression, as if<p></p>
        she was accustomed to such treatment.<p></p>
        That expression made him uneasy, and without meaning to, he found himself staring<p></p>
        at Mahiru. She must have noticed, because she put on a gentle smile and said, "Thank<p></p>
        you ever so much for helping me. Let's finish this up before it gets too late, shall we?"<p></p>
        Her voice was calm and collected, and both Amane and Yuuta nodded, unable to say<p></p>
        anything further.<p></p>
        The three of them worked in awkward silence, and once they had finished the job,<p></p>
        Mahiru left for home first. After waiting a while to stagger their times, Amane headed<p></p>
        back as well.<p></p>
        When he returned to his apartment, he took a long look at Mahiru's face.<p></p>
        Her expression was the same as always, and no sign of hurt or anger darkened her<p></p>
        beautiful face. Instead, it was Amane who felt irritated as he recalled those girls'<p></p>
        words.<p></p>
        Mahiru noticed the sour look on Amane's face, and she quickly gave him a bitter smile.<p></p>
        "Are you perhaps worrying about what happened at school earlier?"<p></p>
        "…It's bothering me."<p></p>
        Of course, he was going to get angry at people who wouldn't say anything to her face<p></p>
        but snuck around in the shadows bad-mouthing her.<p></p>
        Amane sat down beside Mahiru and took another long look at her; she was smiling at<p></p>
        his behavior like she always did.<p></p>
        "That kind of stuff doesn't bother me so much. I expect that degree of gossip, actually;<p></p>
        it would be stranger not to hear it."<p></p>
        Amane was the only one who was bothered by it and by Mahiru's total, nonchalant<p></p>
        acceptance of the idea that some people hated her.<p></p>
        He knew the reason why Mahiru conducted herself as an angel, so it was surprising<p></p>
        that it didn't upset her, and his awkward expression showed it.<p></p>
        "I-is that really how it is?"<p></p>
        "It's only natural, right? It's not like everyone is going to like me, you know. It would<p></p>
        be kind of scary if a person like that existed," Mahiru said quietly and dispassionately,<p></p>
        twirling a piece of hair around her fingertip as if she was bored.<p></p>
        "I think that I make it easy for people to like me," she continued, "but I doubt that<p></p>
        works for every single person in school. It's just that all the kind voices are usually<p></p>
        louder and easier to hear. The supportive voices of kind people just help block out the<p></p>
        hate. I mean, even you didn't like me that much at first, I think."<p></p>
        "…It truly pains me to hear you say that, but…"<p></p>
        Sure, before he had gotten to know Mahiru, when he had only known her by her<p></p>
        reputation, Amane had thought of her as someone who excelled in everything and was<p></p>
        beautiful. He knew that she was desirable due to those traits.<p></p>
        But he would say he fell into the category of people who didn't particularly care much<p></p>
        for the angel, at least not on a personal level. When everything about her had seemed<p></p>
        too perfect, he'd found her almost unapproachable.<p></p>
        "Especially among the girls," Mahiru said, "there are people who act friendly on the<p></p>
        surface, when they actually hate me. Since so many people admire me, they bad-mouth<p></p>
        me to mask their own insecurities. I just try to get along with as many people as I can.<p></p>
        It makes everything easier, you see."<p></p>
        Mahiru matter-of-factly evaluated her position relative to the people who hated her.<p></p>
        Amane wasn't sure what he could possibly say in response.<p></p>
        He figured that girls and boys must live in different worlds, with different rules for<p></p>
        human interactions. If Mahiru was telling him this, it probably meant that there were<p></p>
        people out there who shunned her, and she had really heard them say such things<p></p>
        before.<p></p>
        He wasn't able to come up with the right words and couldn't do anything but sit there<p></p>
        uneasily. Mahiru must have noticed, because she relaxed into a smile.<p></p>
        "There are way fewer of them now, but there have always been a certain percentage<p></p>
        of people who hate me, so I'm used to it. I'm careful to conduct myself in a way that<p></p>
        reduces that number as much as possible, but it will never be zero. There are some<p></p>
        people who detest me because the majority likes me."<p></p>
        "…Isn't that painful?"<p></p>
        "Well, I'm sure I wouldn't like it very much if anyone ever said it to my face, but to date,<p></p>
        no one has made such a declaration. Besides, I'm sure that people like the ones today<p></p>
        who say they hate me aren't talking about the real me; they just resent my outward<p></p>
        appearance and social standing. There's not really anything I can do about that, so I<p></p>
        don't plan to try."<p></p>
        "That's very pragmatic…"<p></p>
        "If I wasn't pragmatic about it, I wouldn't be able to stand acting the way I do at school."<p></p>
        Mahiru, who was more disciplined than anyone Amane knew, had a quiet, thoughtful<p></p>
        look in her eyes. A small sigh escaped her lips.<p></p>
        "I am aware that, objectively, I have more attractive features than many other people,"<p></p>
        she said. "Some of it is genetic, but I also put a lot of work into my appearance. There<p></p>
        are people who find me superficial just because I value that."<p></p>
        Her words weren't an exaggeration or presumptuous in any way; they were the<p></p>
        foundation for her self-confidence.<p></p>
        Certainly, Amane was not about to deny her natural beauty, especially having seen her<p></p>
        mother, who she took after.<p></p>
        But Mahiru's charms didn't lie in the features she had inherited.<p></p>
        Her demeanor and conduct, the way she wielded her gaze and her expressions, the<p></p>
        very atmosphere that surrounded her… she had not been born with any of those<p></p>
        things, but they were what made her truly lovely. Amane thought that her remarkable<p></p>
        intelligence and personal character were more beautiful than even her outward 1<p></p>
        appearance.<p></p>
        …Still, she is very pretty… 1<p></p>
        Mahiru's willpower was so brilliant, it seemed like he would be burned by the<p></p>
        radiance. Mahiru herself seemed like she also might be scorched by that light, and it<p></p>
        was a little scary.<p></p>
        "I put a lot of effort into things you can't see on the surface, you know. That's why some<p></p>
        people who can only see the end result assume that I must be cheating somehow. And<p></p>
        their feelings of envy aren't my responsibility. Of course, if I was able to correct one<p></p>
        thing, I think it would be the way people talk about me and Kadowaki. We get along<p></p>
        well, but there's absolutely nothing romantic going on between us. People<p></p>
        misunderstand that and get jealous, which is bothersome."<p></p>
        "I… I see…"<p></p>
        "I mean, have I ever behaved like I was into him? I think he's a considerate and likeable<p></p>
        guy, but I don't have any romantic feelings toward him at all. But people start<p></p>
        speculating if I so much as talk to him, and it's annoying."<p></p>
        What seemed to really bother her was the sheer frequency of the rumors.<p></p>
        Mahiru and Yuuta, who had been transformed into idols of sorts by their schoolmates,<p></p>
        were often paired up in people's minds, since they were both role models to their<p></p>
        respective sexes.<p></p>
        In reality, they barely interacted. When Mahiru had made Amane's acquaintance, she<p></p>
        at best knew of Yuuta as a popular guy on campus but hadn't known him personally.<p></p>
        They only became friends when Amane started hanging out with him.<p></p>
        Amane had never suspected that Mahiru had any romantic feelings toward Yuuta. She<p></p>
        had always treated the "prince" of the school with impartiality.<p></p>
        "Maybe to the girls crushing on Kadowaki, it looks like he's already taken," Amane said.<p></p>
        "Most guys, if you approached them, Mahiru, would go crazy for you."<p></p>
        "Hmm, it doesn't seem like you're in that group, Amane."<p></p>
        "…Well…"<p></p>
        He was already completely infatuated, no approach necessary. He felt like nothing she 1<p></p>
        did would change how deep his feelings of love for her were, but he couldn't tell her<p></p>
        that.<p></p>
        Amane glanced nervously about as he tried to come up with a response, but Mahiru<p></p>
        was staring directly at him.<p></p>
        He couldn't stand the pressure, so he looked away from her, but he saw her sigh from<p></p>
        out of the corner of his eye.<p></p>
        "At any rate, Kadowaki isn't my type. Objectively, he is very handsome, and quite the<p></p>
        well-mannered gentleman, too, but… how do I put this…? In some ways, our situations<p></p>
        are similar, so I'm happy to have him as an acquaintance or friend, maybe even as<p></p>
        someone I can look to for support. But I don't feel like any of that is leading toward us<p></p>
        falling in love."<p></p>
        "…I guess when you think about it, you and Kadowaki do have some things in<p></p>
        common," Amane agreed. "Though there's not such a big difference between his public<p></p>
        and private self as there is between yours."<p></p>
        This was something that Amane had come to understand recently as he'd gotten to<p></p>
        know Yuuta better. Like her, Yuuta also tended to try to act the way that everybody<p></p>
        expected him to. However, it wasn't as obvious as when Mahiru did it, and he usually<p></p>
        let some of his real personality show through.<p></p>
        Mahiru had no choice but to act the way she did because of her family background.<p></p>
        The reason she did it and the degree to which she had to maintain the act were<p></p>
        different, so they were similar but not the same.<p></p>
        "You make it sound like I have a split personality… A-are my public and private selves<p></p>
        really that different?"<p></p>
        "They are, but how can I put this… Your true self is much cuter than your angel<p></p>
        persona. At first, well, you seemed cool and serious, but once I got to know you, I found<p></p>
        you to be an honest person who's much shier than I expected. The way you express<p></p>
        emotions with your words and actions is completely different, too, so… yeah, there's<p></p>
        a difference, you know?"<p></p>
        "Wh-who exactly do you think is making me act like this?"<p></p>
        "…That's, well, hmm. It's not on purpose."<p></p>
        It wasn't that he was doing it intentionally. It was just that Mahiru got embarrassed<p></p>
        easily whenever someone gave her an honest compliment.<p></p>
        Amane understood perfectly well that she had always been a hard worker and very<p></p>
        disciplined, so he had been trying to give her frank, genuine praise as often as he could.<p></p>
        If that brought out her bashful side, well, it was too late to do anything about that.<p></p>
        "I think it's even more wicked of you to do it not on purpose, though."<p></p>
        "You could say the same thing about yourself. You're the heartless one, Mahiru."<p></p>
        "What is that supposed to mean?"<p></p>
        "…In your case, you've been getting more and more touchy, and it's hard to deal with."<p></p>
        Mahiru especially had no room to criticize Amane. She had a talent for making people<p></p>
        blush and used it quite often. To make matters worse, she often carried out surprise<p></p>
        attacks, forcing Amane into difficult tests of willpower on a daily basis.<p></p>
        At the word "touchy," Mahiru's large eyes opened even wider, and she blinked several<p></p>
        times. Then she gasped, and her lip started trembling.<p></p>
        Amane couldn't help but notice a deep red slowly staining her cheeks.<p></p>
        "I-it's not on purpose." Once she'd reached a lovely shade of cherry, Mahiru offered<p></p>
        this excuse in a wavering voice. "There are times when I do touch you on purpose, but<p></p>
        I never meant to make you uncomfortable."<p></p>
        "I have several questions about your definition of 'on purpose,' but I know that you<p></p>
        didn't really mean anything by it. You should just be careful, though, because if a girl<p></p>
        does stuff like that too often, someone could get the wrong idea."<p></p>
        "…I only do it with you."<p></p>
        "I know that, too. That's why I'm telling you."<p></p>
        Amane couldn't be certain what kind of feelings Mahiru had toward him, but he knew<p></p>
        she thought he was special, and that she liked him.<p></p>
        Still, he was a guy, and her thoughtless contact often troubled him. He thought he'd<p></p>
        appreciate it if she toned it down a little, for his sanity's sake if nothing else.<p></p>
        When he looked in Mahiru's direction, Amane noticed that her face was still very red.<p></p>
        Mahiru smacked his upper arm playfully.<p></p>
        "See? That's what I'm talking about," he protested.<p></p>
        "That time was on purpose."<p></p>
        "Okay…"<p></p>
        Mahiru gave Amane a bit of a scowl. He didn't understand what he'd done wrong. Even<p></p>
        though she was glaring at him, the expression on her face and the embarrassment in<p></p>
        her eyes made her look nothing if not adorable.<p></p>
        Amane got the feeling that if he told her she looked more cute than scary, she'd<p></p>
        probably be even angrier.<p></p>
        So, he didn't say anything at all, and Mahiru cleared her throat and straightened up.<p></p>
        "Anyway, back to what we were talking about earlier," she said. "It doesn't really bother<p></p>
        me that some girls hate me. It's a childish dream to think that everyone will always get<p></p>
        along, after all, and I know it'd only cause more problems trying to force it, so I've<p></p>
        accepted that certain people just won't like me."<p></p>
        "…Mm-hmm."<p></p>
        "This contradicts what I was saying earlier, but after pretending to be nice and acting<p></p>
        the part of the angel that everyone adores for so long, recently I've started to think<p></p>
        that maybe I've had enough."<p></p>
        "Really?"<p></p>
        Amane never expected to hear those words from Mahiru, who maintained her angelic<p></p>
        persona with such tireless consistency, and he thoughtlessly repeated her words back<p></p>
        to her.<p></p>
        Mahiru smiled faintly. "I've been thinking, maybe I don't need to be such a good girl…<p></p>
        I've always tried to keep up an act so that everyone will like me, even though I knew it<p></p>
        wouldn't work on everyone. But if I had someone who could discover the real me, and<p></p>
        really see me for who I am, I could be happy just being myself, I think."<p></p>
        Mahiru's eyes wavered with a certain lonesomeness as she thought back on her past<p></p>
        self, and soon her caramel-coloured eyes shone brightly.<p></p>
        "You said you wouldn't take your eyes off me, right, Amane?"<p></p>
        Anyone could have seen that the light contained joyful hope for the future. It wasn't<p></p>
    </main>
