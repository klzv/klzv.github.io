        <p></p>Chapter 1: Meeting an Angel 
        <p></p>"…What're you doing?"
        <p></p>The first time Amane Fujimiya spoke to Mahiru Shiina was when he caught sight of
        <p></p>her sitting on a swing in the park, in the middle of the pouring rain.
        <p></p>This was Amane's first year as a high school student. He'd recently begun living alone
        <p></p>in a nearby apartment building. Little did he know when he first moved in that his
        <p></p>next-door neighbor was a veritable angel on Earth.
        <p></p>Of course, calling her an angel was just a figure of speech, but Mahiru Shiina was such
        <p></p>a beautiful, sweet girl that the comparison seemed entirely fitting.
        <p></p>Her straight, well-groomed, flaxen hair was always silky smooth and lustrous. The
        <p></p>girl's pale, milky-white skin was always soft, as if it had never been anything less than
        <p></p>perfect. From her shapely nose and large eyes rimmed with long eyelashes to her
        <p></p>delicate, dewy pink lips, every part of her looked like it had been sculpted by the
        <p></p>practiced hand of a true master.
        <p></p>Amane went to the same high school as Mahiru and was in the same grade, so he'd
        <p></p>heard plenty about her. Mostly, people talked about her beauty or how she was
        <p></p>accomplished in both academics and sports.
        <p></p>As it happened, Mahiru always got the top score on exams and was a real ace in gym
        <p></p>class, too. Amane was in a different class, so he didn't know all the details, but if the
        <p></p>rumors were anything to judge by, Mahiru was some kind of superhuman being.
        <p></p>Truly, she seemed without a flaw—attractive in face and figure and an excellent
        <p></p>student. Perhaps most surprising was that she wasn't the least bit stuck-up about it.
        <p></p>With her quiet, modest personality, it was no wonder she was so popular.
        <p></p>Living next door to such a beautiful girl would've gotten most boys practically salivating
        <p></p>at the mere thought. Amane, however, didn't intend to make a fuss over her or try to
        <p></p>get too close.
        <p></p>He certainly wouldn't deny that Mahiru Shiina was beautiful, but she had never been
        <p></p>more than a neighbor to him. There hadn't really been any opportunities for them to
        <p></p>talk, and not once did he consider approaching her himself.
        <p></p>If they did somehow become involved in some fashion, it would definitely make a lot
        <p></p>of other boys jealous, and that'd be trouble. Amane knew it was better to remain
        <p></p>amicable next-door neighbors and avoid the wrath of her other admirers.
        <p></p>It was possible to appreciate a charming girl without falling in love with her, after all.
        <p></p>Amane recognized that Mahiru was the kind of girl best cherished from afar and had
        <p></p>contented himself with existing in her life as only her neighbor.
        <p></p>Thus, when Amane caught sight of her looking lost in thought and alone in the pouring
        <p></p>rain without an umbrella, he couldn't help but stop and stare, wondering what she
        <p></p>might be doing.
        <p></p>The downpour was heavy enough to send most everyone else scurrying home, but
        <p></p>there she was, sitting all by herself on a swing in the park between their school and
        <p></p>their apartment building.
        <p></p>What is she doing in the rain? Amane wondered.
        <p></p>Everything was gloomy beneath the darkened sky, and the rain, relentless since that
        <p></p>morning, only made it even more difficult to see. Mahiru's conspicuous flaxen hair and
        <p></p>her school uniform made it impossible to miss her, however, even veiled by the dismal
        <p></p>weather.
        <p></p>Amane did not know why she was sitting there without an umbrella, letting herself
        <p></p>get soaked. Mahiru didn't appear to be waiting for someone, nor did she seem at all
        <p></p>concerned by the rain. As far as Amane could tell, Mahiru was simply staring off into
        <p></p>the distance.
        <p></p>Her face was tilted slightly upward, and though she was always pale, her complexion
        <p></p>appeared downright pallid. If she wasn't careful, she was sure to catch a cold, but even
        <p></p>so, Mahiru sat there quietly, not making any move to head home.
        <p></p>If she's content to sit there, it probably isn't my place to interfere, Amane thought as he
        <p></p>made his way quickly past the park. He took one last look and could see that Mahiru's
        <p></p>face was screwed up as if she might cry.
        <p></p>Amane scratched his head nervously. He wasn't really looking to make any kind of
        <p></p>connection with her or anything, but it seemed wrong to him to ignore another person
        <p></p>who was making such a pained expression.
        <p></p>"…What're you doing?"
        <p></p>When he called out to her in the bluntest voice possible, trying to convey that he was
        <p></p>not a threat, she tossed her long hair, now heavy with water, and looked at him.
        <p></p>Mahiru's face was as lovely as ever.
        <p></p>Even wet with rain, its radiance was not dulled. In fact, every droplet only seemed to
        <p></p>enhance her elegant features. One could say she was dripping with beauty.
        <p></p>She stared at him with large, striking eyes.
        <p></p>Mahiru must have been vaguely aware of Amane as her next-door neighbor because
        <p></p>they occasionally passed each other in the morning. However, the look in her caramel-coloured eyes
        <p></p>revealed that she was slightly guarded—someone she had never really
        <p></p>spoken with had suddenly called out to her.
        <p></p>"Fujimiya? May I help you?"
        <p></p>Amane was rather shocked that Mahiru had remembered his name, but at the same
        <p></p>time, he also figured that this level of familiarity most likely wouldn't cause her to drop
        <p></p>her guard. It was only to be expected that Mahiru would raise her defenses when
        <p></p>confronted by a stranger, even if he wasn't entirely unknown.
        <p></p>She probably didn't want much to do with the opposite sex. It certainly seemed like
        <p></p>she received plenty of romantic advances from the boys at school, regardless of what
        <p></p>year they were in. Would anyone have blamed Mahiru for suspecting Amane of
        <p></p>harboring an ulterior motive?
        <p></p>"I don't really need anything. I was just wondering why you were sitting in a place like
        <p></p>this, all alone in the rain."
        <p></p>"Oh, you were? I'm grateful for your concern, but I'm here simply because I want to be.
        <p></p>Don't worry about me."
        <p></p>There was no edge of suspicion in Mahiru's soft, listless voice, but it was also clear that
        <p></p>she had no intention of opening up to Amane.
        <p></p>All right, suit yourself.
        <p></p>It was clear that there was something going on with her, but she didn't seem to want
        <p></p>Amane to get involved, and he wasn't particularly inclined to pursue the matter any
        <p></p>further.
        <p></p>Amane had only approached her on a whim. He'd simply been curious about her
        <p></p>situation; that was all. It wasn't really his concern. If this was what she wanted to be
        <p></p>doing, then that was just fine by him.
        <p></p>Amane sensed the evanescent beauty regarding him with some suspicion. He was sure
        <p></p>that Mahiru was wondering why he'd even bothered speaking to her at all.
        <p></p>"Ah, I see," he offered in reply.
        <p></p>Pressing the issue wouldn't get him anywhere, so Amane decided to withdraw. There
        <p></p>was no shared history between them, and perhaps that was for the best. The decision
        <p></p>to leave her alone was an easy one.
        <p></p>Even with a very good reason to depart, Amane still didn't think it seemed right to
        <p></p>abandon her—and thoroughly soaked to boot.
        <p></p>"You'll catch a cold, so take this and go home. No need to bother giving it back."
        <p></p>Deciding this would be the one and only time he meddled, Amane offered Mahiru his
        <p></p>own umbrella. After all, he didn't want her to get sick or anything.
        <p></p>Amane handed over the umbrella—or to put it more accurately, he gave her little
        <p></p>choice but to accept. Without giving Mahiru a chance to reply, he turned away and took
        <p></p>off. As he left the scene, Amane heard Mahiru calling to him.
        <p></p>Whatever she was trying to say was too quiet and became drowned out by the rain.
        <p></p>Amane didn't stop or turn around until the park was well behind him.
        <p></p>He had cared enough about the girl possibly catching a cold to foist his umbrella on
        <p></p>her, so he didn't feel that guilty about the fact that he had originally intended to ignore
        <p></p>her altogether.
        <p></p>At any rate, Mahiru had refused his attempt to start a conversation, and Amane didn't
        <p></p>intend to get any closer to her, either. After all, they had no connection to each other
        <p></p>beyond this.
        <p></p>Amane assured himself along those lines as he made his way home.
        <p></p>Chapter 2: A Cold–and Being Nursed by an Angel 
        <p></p>"Amane, your sniffling's annoying."
        <p></p>"You're annoying."
        <p></p>The next day, it was Amane who'd ended up with the cold.
        <p></p>As his classmate and good friend Itsuki Akazawa had pointed out, Amane had been
        <p></p>trying and failing to snort everything back up his nose. Trying to exhale only resulted
        <p></p>in a terrible, wet, burbling sound.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure whether it was because his nose was stuffed up or as a result of
        <p></p>the cold itself, but a throbbing pain was spreading across the back of his head. He had
        <p></p>taken some over-the-counter medicine, but it wasn't making a dent in his symptoms
        <p></p>at all. Truly, Amane was a sad sight. His congested face twisted in nasal distress as he
        <p></p>became well acquainted with a tissue.
        <p></p>Itsuki looked at him, not with concern but exasperation.
        <p></p>"You were just fine yesterday, dude."
        <p></p>"I got caught in the rain."
        <p></p>"Aw, chin up. Wait, didn't you have an umbrella yesterday?"
        <p></p>"…I gave it to someone."
        <p></p>Naturally, there was no way that Amane could openly admit at school that he'd given
        <p></p>it to Mahiru, so he kept things vague.
        <p></p>Incidentally, he'd caught a glimpse of Mahiru earlier that day. She'd looked rather well,
        <p></p>not ill at all. Amane couldn't help but laugh. Things had gotten completely flipped around.
        <p></p>It was his own fault—he'd neglected to warm up in the bath when he'd gotten home.
        <p></p>"Don'cha think you were being a little too nice, lending out your umbrella when it was
        <p></p>pouring like that?"
        <p></p>"Not really. Even if I did, no point complaining about it now."
        <p></p>"And who did you give it to anyway? Who was worth catching a cold?"
        <p></p>"…A, uh, a lost little kid?"
        <p></p>Can't really call her a kid with that body, though… Well, that and the fact that we're the
        <p></p>same age. Although, her face did look kinda lost…
        <p></p>Something clicked when Amane thought of the unusual encounter that way. Her
        <p></p>expression had been exactly that of a lost little kid searching for their parent.
        <p></p>"Well, what a kind and upstanding gentleman you are!" Itsuki laughed, unaware of the
        <p></p>feelings bubbling up in Amane's chest as he recalled his meeting with Mahiru the day
        <p></p>before. "But you know, even if you let someone borrow your umbrella or whatever, I
        <p></p>bet your real problem was that you got lazy and didn't warm up afterward. That's why
        <p></p>you're dying."
        <p></p>"…How do you know that?" Amane shot back.
        <p></p>"Well, you don't exactly take good care of yourself. That much was obvious the moment
        <p></p>I saw your place. That's why you got sick, dumbass."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't really argue with Itsuki's friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn't
        <p></p>have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy,
        <p></p>and his room was always a total mess. What's more, he subsisted on a diet of
        <p></p>convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent
        <p></p>meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated
        <p></p>with him, asking him how he could live like that.
        <p></p>Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had
        <p></p>caught a cold overnight.
        <p></p>"You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow's Saturday, so focus on
        <p></p>getting better," Itsuki advised.
        <p></p>"I will…," Amane replied.
        <p></p>"If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do." Itsuki's lips curled up
        <p></p>at his slight boast.
        <p></p>"Shut up. I don't need to hear that from a guy who's already got a girlfriend." Amane
        <p></p>slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely
        <p></p>irritated.
        <p></p>As the day wore on, Amane's condition continued to deteriorate.
        <p></p>The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that
        <p></p>permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body
        <p></p>seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow.
        <p></p>Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs
        <p></p>to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was
        <p></p>rougher than usual, and he felt hot.
        <p></p>Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he'd let his
        <p></p>guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn
        <p></p>for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally
        <p></p>not a concern, was now a source of dull agony.
        <p></p>When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane's floor, he staggered out on leaden
        <p></p>feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted
        <p></p>by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
        <p></p>Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her
        <p></p>shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her
        <p></p>complexion vibrant and glowing.
        <p></p>Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she
        <p></p>was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display.
        <p></p>In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day
        <p></p>before, neatly folded and closed.
        <p></p>She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn't have to, Amane reasoned.
        <p></p>"…Really, you don't need to give it back," he said aloud.
        <p></p>"It's only natural to return something you borrowed…" Mahiru hesitated as soon as
        <p></p>she got a good look at Amane's face. "Um. You have a fever, don't you…?"
        <p></p>"…It's got nothing to do with you."
        <p></p>Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru—and
        <p></p>all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn't have been worth
        <p></p>the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure
        <p></p>out how Amane had caught a cold.
        <p></p>"But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella…"
        <p></p>"That's totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim."
        <p></p>"It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there
        <p></p>in the rain."
        <p></p>"I said it's fine, really. It's not something you need to worry about."
        <p></p>From Amane's perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self-satisfaction, and
        <p></p>he didn't want her fussing over him now.
        <p></p>However, Mahiru didn't seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across
        <p></p>her graceful features.
        <p></p>"…So yeah, it's all good. See ya." Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so
        <p></p>Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru's questioning and concern.
        <p></p>Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of
        <p></p>his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit
        <p></p>as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength
        <p></p>left his body.
        <p></p>Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his
        <p></p>body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him.
        <p></p>Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it
        <p></p>wouldn't break, and he wouldn't fall. Surely it would catch him, and he'd be fine.
        <p></p>The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there's no avoiding it…, Amane thought,
        <p></p>resigning himself to the pain.
        <p></p>However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright.
        <p></p>"…Just as I thought; I can't leave you alone like this." Amane heard a fragile voice through
        <p></p>his feverish haze. "I'll repay your favor."
        <p></p>Amane's head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up.
        <p></p>Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and
        <p></p>opened the door to his apartment.
        <p></p>"I'm going to help you inside. There's no other way, so please forgive the intrusion."
        <p></p>Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument.
        <p></p>The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering
        <p></p>his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he
        <p></p>didn't have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had
        <p></p>descended to care for him instead.
        <p></p>Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his
        <p></p>place until it was too late. It wasn't until he saw the condition his home was in that he
        <p></p>regretted ever letting Mahiru enter.
        <p></p>His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and
        <p></p>main living space.
        <p></p>It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane's parents
        <p></p>were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the
        <p></p>neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always
        <p></p>thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment
        <p></p>was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he
        <p></p>wasn't about to complain.
        <p></p>Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were
        <p></p>not kept especially tidy. Various items were scattered all over the living room, and
        <p></p>needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom.
        <p></p>"This is too pitiful to look at." The angel, Amane's savior, gave him a frank assessment
        <p></p>of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming
        <p></p>appearance.
        <p></p>Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he'd known that he'd be
        <p></p>bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied
        <p></p>up a bit, but it was too late for that now.
        <p></p>Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane
        <p></p>into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some
        <p></p>serious cleaning sometime soon.
        <p></p>"First, I'm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get
        <p></p>back. You can do that, right?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"…You're coming back?"
        <p></p>"My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,"
        <p></p>Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt
        <p></p>toward her when she was soaking wet the day before.
        <p></p>Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he
        <p></p>was told and started changing out of his school uniform.
        <p></p>"It's really a mess in here; there's nowhere to even step… How can anyone live like
        <p></p>this…?"
        <p></p>As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next
        <p></p>room, and felt quite ashamed.
        <p></p>After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without
        <p></p>realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was
        <p></p>the first thing he saw.
        <p></p>Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side,
        <p></p>peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream.
        <p></p>"…What time is it?" Amane asked, confused.
        <p></p>"Seven in the evening," Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. "You slept for several hours."
        <p></p>As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had
        <p></p>poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was
        <p></p>able to take a look at his surroundings.
        <p></p>Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.
        <p></p>He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did,
        <p></p>his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth.
        <p></p>There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn't have any of those at
        <p></p>his place, and he looked up at Mahiru.
        <p></p>"I brought it from home," she answered immediately.
        <p></p>Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks, either. Mahiru
        <p></p>must have brought that over as well.
        <p></p>"…Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble."
        <p></p>"It's fine."
        <p></p>There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru's curt answer.
        <p></p>Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn't mean
        <p></p>that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was
        <p></p>already talking with a boy she barely knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That
        <p></p>she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only
        <p></p>natural.
        <p></p>"For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It's better
        <p></p>to take it with something in your stomach… Are you hungry at all?" Mahiru asked gently.
        <p></p>"Mm, a little bit," Amane answered.
        <p></p>"Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you're welcome to have
        <p></p>some."
        <p></p>"…Huh, you made it yourself?"
        <p></p>"Is there anyone else here but me? If you don't want it, I'll eat it all alone."
        <p></p>"No, I'll eat it! Please let me eat it!"
        <p></p>Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment,
        <p></p>he was caught off guard.
        <p></p>Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he'd never heard
        <p></p>rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn't be awful.
        <p></p>Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane's sudden bow and insistence that he
        <p></p>would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting
        <p></p>on the side table.
        <p></p>"I'll bring it to you, so take your temperature first."
        <p></p>"Okay," Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning
        <p></p>his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away.
        <p></p>"Do it after I leave the room, please." There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane
        <p></p>spied that the girl's pale cheeks were tinged red.
        <p></p>Amane hadn't thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn't consider
        <p></p>it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn't
        <p></p>accustomed to seeing much skin.
        <p></p>Mahiru's alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned
        <p></p>away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her
        <p></p>shyness almost palpable.
        <p></p>…Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is.
        <p></p>Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he'd also never had any
        <p></p>special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He
        <p></p>had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire
        <p></p>her like one would a distant masterpiece.
        <p></p>Mahiru wasn't some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking
        <p></p>slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some
        <p></p>idol, and it was strangely adorable.
        <p></p>The two didn't have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that
        <p></p>he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird
        <p></p>if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself.
        <p></p>"…Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?" he asked.
        <p></p>"Y-you don't have to tell me," Mahiru answered dismissively. "I'll be right back." She
        <p></p>turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away.
        <p></p>It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe
        <p></p>because of all the clutter. Probably the latter.
        <p></p>After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out
        <p></p>this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh.
        <p></p>…Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened.
        <p></p>Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too
        <p></p>dangerous; she could be attacked or something.
        <p></p>Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must've meant she was worried about him.
        <p></p>Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn't
        <p></p>think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of
        <p></p>obligation.
        <p></p>Amane's mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
        <p></p>Then came a hesitant knock at the door.
        <p></p>"…I've brought the porridge."
        <p></p>At the sound of Mahiru's concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered
        <p></p>again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature.
        <p></p>"I haven't taken my temperature yet," he called back.
        <p></p>"I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though…"
        <p></p>"Sorry, I spaced out."
        <p></p>Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few
        <p></p>moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to
        <p></p>look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn't bad
        <p></p>enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high.
        <p></p>"Okay, I'm finished," Amane said as he put his shirt back on.
        <p></p>Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting
        <p></p>on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes.
        <p></p>"What was your temperature?" she asked.
        <p></p>"Thirty-eight point three. I'll be better after I take some medicine and get some more
        <p></p>sleep."
        <p></p>"…Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won't eliminate the virus
        <p></p>itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job."
        <p></p>Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed
        <p></p>Amane.
        <p></p>Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then
        <p></p>opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely
        <p></p>watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had
        <p></p>done that intentionally because she'd thought it'd be easier on Amane's stomach.
        <p></p>She'd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting
        <p></p>colds.
        <p></p>The dish wasn't steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru
        <p></p>hadn't brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool
        <p></p>down first.
        <p></p>Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl
        <p></p>with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and
        <p></p>had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of
        <p></p>the rice mixed easily.
        <p></p>"Here you go. It shouldn't be too hot."
        <p></p>"Mm, thank you."
        <p></p>Mahiru gave Amane a puzzled look as he received the bowl, but then he merely stared
        <p></p>at the porridge while his spoon hovered over it.
        <p></p>"…What is it; you want me to feed you? Sorry, but that's not on the menu," Mahiru
        <p></p>asserted.
        <p></p>"Nobody asked for that, okay? It's just… So I guess you can cook, too, huh?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"I live alone, so of course I can." The girl's words stung, a heavy reminder of Amane's
        <p></p>own domestic failures. "But before you learn to cook, you should learn to clean up your
        <p></p>room, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>"Yes, ma'am…"
        <p></p>Mahiru had quickly and thoroughly put him in his place. Amane grumbled quietly and
        <p></p>scooped up some of the porridge, stuffing the spoon into his mouth in a bid to end the
        <p></p>conversation.
        <p></p>The flavor of the lightly salted rice spread across his tongue as he ate the porridge.
        <p></p>The mellow sourness of the pickled plums pulled it all together. It was truly a dish with
        <p></p>a perfect balance of flavors.
        <p></p>Amane didn't like pickled plums that were too salty, but these had a milder taste and
        <p></p>a bit of sweetness. They were actually a favorite of his. Often, he liked to top green tea
        <p></p>rice with pickled plums.
        <p></p>"It's good."
        <p></p>"Thanks for saying so. Though, really, once you've tasted one rice porridge, I think
        <p></p>you've probably tasted them all." Mahiru's answer appeared indifferent, save for the
        <p></p>very slightest beginnings of a smile.
        <p></p>Without meaning to, Amane found himself staring at the beautiful girl's relieved
        <p></p>expression. Something about it seemed quite different from the more outgoing smile
        <p></p>he occasionally caught her wearing at school.
        <p></p>"…Fujimiya?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"Sorry, it's nothing," he answered.
        <p></p>Amane thought it a shame that such a beautiful smile had been so fleeting, though he
        <p></p>kept the musing to himself. Instead, he shoveled spoonful after spoonful of porridge
        <p></p>into his mouth.
        <p></p>"…Anyhow, you rest today. And make sure to replenish your fluids. If you need to wipe
        <p></p>away sweat, use this. I've put water into your washbowl, so make sure to wet it and
        <p></p>wring it out before wiping, okay?"
        <p></p>After Amane had eaten, Mahiru diligently prepared an unopened sports drink, readied
        <p></p>the bowl of water, and laid out a towel and spare cooling sheets. All had been carefully
        <p></p>placed on the side table in Amane's bedroom.
        <p></p>There was no way Mahiru was going to stay over at the home of a boy she barely knew.
        <p></p>Amane wouldn't have stood for it if she'd tried. Thus, Mahiru had prepared everything
        <p></p>Amane could've needed while he rested, and he was grateful for her diligence, though
        <p></p>he stared at her the whole time she got everything ready.
        <p></p>This is an awful lot just to repay a favor. Once this is over, I guess we won't have much
        <p></p>reason to interact. It's a one-off thing, a freak occurrence; that's all.
        <p></p>Well, since we won't be talking ever again, I guess it's all right to ask about that thing I
        <p></p>want to know.
        <p></p>Whether from the medicine or his nap, Amane's head felt clearer, though he was still
        <p></p>exhausted.
        <p></p>"Hey, there's something I've been wondering…," he started.
        <p></p>"What is it?" Mahiru turned to look at him from where she was setting up all the
        <p></p>essentials he'd need.
        <p></p>"Why were you sitting out in the rain? Did you have a fight with your boyfriend or
        <p></p>something?" The strange behavior that'd kicked off this whole chain of events had
        <p></p>been on Amane's mind since he'd first noticed it. Mahiru had been rocking back and
        <p></p>forth on a swing in the pouring rain. What could she have been doing there?
        <p></p>It was precisely because Amane had been curious about Mahiru's slight resemblance
        <p></p>to a lost child that he'd offered her his umbrella in the first place. He'd never
        <p></p>discovered why she'd been out there in the storm to begin with, however.
        <p></p>Amane had thought Mahiru had been waiting for someone, so he'd guessed that there
        <p></p>was a boy she was dating, even wondering if perhaps she and her boyfriend had gotten
        <p></p>into an argument. In response to Amane's question, Mahiru looked at him as if she was
        <p></p>fed up.
        <p></p>"Sorry, but I don't have a boyfriend, and I have no plans to get one," she replied.
        <p></p>"Huh? Why?" Amane asked almost unconsciously.
        <p></p>"Let me ask you, why did you assume I was dating someone?"
        <p></p>"With how popular you are, I thought you'd have at least one or two boyfriends."
        <p></p>Something about this back-and-forth made Mahiru seem much more like a normal girl
        <p></p>to Amane. She was kind but strong-willed. To other people, though, he was sure she
        <p></p>seemed quite different. Mahiru was a beautiful girl who was tidy, sweet, quiet, and
        <p></p>humble. Her pretty face, so lovely that she was often called an angel, turned heads
        <p></p>wherever she went, and her body was petite but possessed abundant curves. The
        <p></p>briefest sight of her instilled a strange, momentary feeling of wanting to protect her.
        <p></p>That quality, combined with her excellent sense of style, made her an object of desire
        <p></p>for many a schoolboy.
        <p></p>On top of all that, her grades kept her at the top of her class, and she was an all-around
        <p></p>excellent athlete. What's more, Amane had just learned firsthand that she was good at
        <p></p>cooking, too. That certainly wouldn't hurt her popularity.
        <p></p>Just one glance was enough to know there must have been plenty of guys who were
        <p></p>after her, and Amane knew for a fact that quite a few of his own classmates had
        <p></p>romantic feelings for Mahiru. She could've had her pick of the litter, and it hadn't
        <p></p>occurred to him that she might not be seeing anyone.
        <p></p>That was what Amane had meant when he'd said that thing about one or two
        <p></p>boyfriends, but the moment she'd heard those words, Mahiru's expression had
        <p></p>stiffened, if only for a moment.
        <p></p>"I don't have a boyfriend, and what's more, I'm not the kind of girl who would keep the
        <p></p>company of several boys at once. It's absolutely out of the question."
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes were so cold, they sent a shiver down Amane's spine. He realized
        <p></p>immediately that he'd stepped on some kind of social land mine.
        <p></p>It might have been because of his sickness, but he felt a chill pass over him, and the
        <p></p>room seemed drafty all of a sudden.
        <p></p>"Sorry, that's not what I meant. I apologize," Amane said.
        <p></p>"…No, I'm sorry for getting fired up."
        <p></p>Mahiru bowing her head seemed to disperse the cold, tense atmosphere of the room.
        <p></p>More than being "fired up," Mahiru's icy reply to Amane's question had been like a
        <p></p>blizzard, though he knew better than to point that out.
        <p></p>"Anyway, that's not what was going on at all. I was just trying to cool my head a bit…
        <p></p>And I really am sorry that you caught a cold because you were worried about me,"
        <p></p>Mahiru explained.
        <p></p>"It's fine. I mean, it was my decision, after all. I feel kind of guilty about all this, actually.
        <p></p>I only gave you the umbrella as a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing. I'll try not to
        <p></p>bother you once this is all over."
        <p></p>Amane was sure that Mahiru was only there to help out of some sense of obligation,
        <p></p>but when she heard what he had to say, she blinked a few times and gave him a curious
        <p></p>look. It must have intrigued her to hear that he wouldn't be troubling her again.
        <p></p>"We don't really have any reason to interact, so it's not like it'll be a big deal. I mean,
        <p></p>even if you're the most beautiful girl in our grade, and a genius, and everyone calls you
        <p></p>an angel, I wasn't trying to hook up with you; I swear. You don't think that this was
        <p></p>some kind of scheme or something, do you?" Amane inquired.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked away a little awkwardly. A bitter smile spread across her lips, as if she'd
        <p></p>been waiting for Amane to say those exact words. Finally, he realized that she wasn't
        <p></p>just acting cagey. Mahiru had probably wound up in that sort of situation a few times
        <p></p>before. A guy trying to get in with a beautiful girl by making her feel indebted was,
        <p></p>unfortunately, not unheard of.
        <p></p>It explained why Mahiru had been so wary of Amane that day in the rain. She hadn't
        <p></p>been upset at him; she'd just been trying to protect herself.
        <p></p>"It must be so irritating. Being bothered by guys you don't even like," Amane said.
        <p></p>"Well, that's true, but…" Mahiru's voice trailed off.
        <p></p>"Called it," quipped Amane, a little surprised to hear her admit it.
        <p></p>So the quiet, charming, model student, the one everybody makes a big fuss over, the one
        <p></p>everybody calls an angel, does have things she doesn't like. Why, she even gets annoyed
        <p></p>from time to time, just like the rest of us mortals. The thought gave Amane the sudden
        <p></p>impression that he was seeing the real Mahiru for the first time.
        <p></p>Unfortunately, the way she glared back at Amane seemed to suggest that she was really
        <p></p>regretting having ever met him. It looked like she resented him for making her reveal
        <p></p>how she really felt.
        <p></p>Further proof that the angelic honor student has real emotions hidden deep down,
        <p></p>Amane thought.
        <p></p>"I don't really see the problem with that," admitted Amane. "Actually, I'm relieved. It's
        <p></p>nice to hear that the angel finds that stuff just as annoying as normal humans."
        <p></p>"…Please stop calling me that." Mahiru obviously hated the title others had given her.
        <p></p>With disapproval in her eyes, she continued to gaze at Amane.
        <p></p>Even her displeasure seemed interesting to Amane, who smiled again and said, "Not
        <p></p>to worry, I won't bother you again without a good reason."
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes opened wide as if his declaration had caught her by surprise. With the
        <p></p>faintest whisper of a smile crossing her lips, she bowed sharply and left.
        <p></p>Amane lay in bed, staring vacantly up at the ceiling while thinking about Mahiru.
        <p></p>Even though the medicine had taken effect, he was, unsurprisingly, still feeling sluggish.
        <p></p>If he relaxed, sleep would surely claim him in no time at all. He closed his eyes and
        <p></p>reflected on the events of the day.
        <p></p>No one would ever believe him if he told them that he'd been nursed back to health by
        <p></p>an angel with a surprisingly sharp tongue. The day's events were a secret shared only
        <p></p>by Amane and Mahiru.
        <p></p>It feels kinda weird to call it a secret. It's more like it'd be a real pain to explain the whole
        <p></p>story. It's just easier not to tell anybody, that's all, Amane reasoned.
        <p></p>As he slowly lost consciousness, Amane told himself that, when tomorrow came, he
        <p></p>and Mahiru would be nothing more than mere acquaintances again.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 3: The Angel’s Generosity 
        <p></p>As Amane had anticipated, he and Mahiru had returned to being nothing more than
        <p></p>two people who attended the same school.
        <p></p>He'd been feeling much better the following day and had happened to run into Mahiru
        <p></p>when he went out to shop at the convenience store, but they hadn't said very much to
        <p></p>each other. Amane did catch that Mahiru looked a little relieved to see him well on his
        <p></p>way to recovery.
        <p></p>Nothing changed back at school on the following Monday, either. The two were back
        <p></p>to being strangers. The only tiny difference was that now, whenever they encountered
        <p></p>each other on the way to school, she would greet him with a quick bow. That was all.
        <p></p>"Oh, Amane, you feeling better?"
        <p></p>"I'm good, thanks."
        <p></p>It seemed that Itsuki had also been worried about Amane. He'd been in rather bad
        <p></p>shape last Friday, after all. Amane's condition had been the first thing Itsuki asked
        <p></p>about when they saw each other outside the school building. Itsuki had even sent
        <p></p>Amane a text over the weekend: "You're not dead, right?"
        <p></p>Amane had sent back a message that he was fine, but it seemed Itsuki had only been
        <p></p>half-convinced, because he let out a deep sigh of relief when he saw in person how
        <p></p>much better his friend was feeling.
        <p></p>"Yeah, well, when I saw you in such bad shape, even I started to worry, man! It's all
        <p></p>good if you're better now. You oughtta take better care of yourself. Start by cleaning
        <p></p>your room or somethin'."
        <p></p>"You sound like somebody else I know," Amane quipped.
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"Nothing. Something happened this weekend that kind of opened my eyes. I'll clean
        <p></p>my place up in a few days."
        <p></p>Itsuki didn't let up. "Nah, man, you gotta sort yourself out now!"
        <p></p>Amane turned away in a huff. It would probably take more than half a day to clean that
        <p></p>mess up.
        <p></p>Looking exasperated, Itsuki backed off a bit, saying, "I mean, you can live however you
        <p></p>want, ya know. But just clear a path you can actually walk through for the next time I
        <p></p>come over."
        <p></p>"…I'll deal with it."
        <p></p>Wearing a sour face the whole time, Amane changed into his indoor shoes and headed
        <p></p>for his classroom. An extremely boisterous room caught his attention as he walked
        <p></p>down a hall, however, and he couldn't help but peek in.
        <p></p>Glancing in through a hallway window, Amane saw Mahiru, as beautiful as she'd ever
        <p></p>been, surrounded by her classmates.
        <p></p>Whenever someone spoke to her, she would turn to them with a quiet smile. Everything
        <p></p>about her persona seemed totally different from the Mahiru he'd seen the other day.
        <p></p>Amane suddenly broke out in a smile.
        <p></p>Noticing his friend's gaze, Itsuki's eyes followed the same path. He saw Mahiru and
        <p></p>immediately understood.
        <p></p>"Shiina, huh? As popular as always. No surprise, given how pretty she is."
        <p></p>"Well, you know what they say. She's an angel. What about you, Itsuki? Think she's
        <p></p>cute?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Yeah, I guess so. But I've got Chi, so only in a sorta aesthetic-appreciation-type way,"
        <p></p>Itsuki replied.
        <p></p>"Quit going on about your girlfriend already."
        <p></p>Itsuki had a girlfriend named Chi, although that was a nickname. Her full name was
        <p></p>Chitose Shirakawa.
        <p></p>They were an extremely close couple, madly in love with each other—it gave Amane
        <p></p>heartburn whenever he saw them together.
        <p></p>Although Amane was quick to dismiss the girlfriend talk, Itsuki didn't seem particularly
        <p></p>offended. Amane often said things like that, so Itsuki just laughed. "You're heartless.
        <p></p>So lemme ask you: Do you think she's cute, Amane?"
        <p></p>"She's definitely beautiful, but that's all," answered Amane.
        <p></p>"How bland," Itsuki commented.
        <p></p>"She's like a flower on a high peak that my hand could never reach. I've got nothing to
        <p></p>do with her. Looking is enough."
        <p></p>"Fair."
        <p></p>Some quirk of fate may have brought Mahiru and Amane together that other day, but
        <p></p>they were truly destined to live in different worlds.
        <p></p>The idea that Amane, a self-admitted hopeless loser, and Mahiru, the beautiful superstudent who could do anything, might one day have any kind of relationship, let alone
        <p></p>a romantic one, was frankly ridiculous. It was a veritable impossibility.
        <p></p>That's right, Amane thought. There's no need to concern myself with her any further.
        <p></p>"…What are you eating?"
        <p></p>The theory that the two would never interact again was quickly disproven. Amane was
        <p></p>sucking down some nutritional jelly on his veranda while gazing up at the sky when
        <p></p>Mahiru called to him.
        <p></p>It'd been too much of a bother to even go to the convenience store, so he was
        <p></p>contenting himself with the pouch of jelly he had at home while getting some air when
        <p></p>Mahiru unexpectedly came out onto her own veranda.
        <p></p>She leaned over her railing slightly, looked at the nutritional jelly pouch that was in
        <p></p>Amane's mouth, and frowned.
        <p></p>For a moment, Amane was frozen; he'd thought she was done with him.
        <p></p>"Can't you see? It's a ten-second energy-replenishment jelly," he finally answered.
        <p></p>"…Don't tell me that's what you're calling dinner?" Mahiru asked, incredulous.
        <p></p>"Of course it is."
        <p></p>"That's all you're eating? A high school boy, with a healthy appetite?"
        <p></p>"That's none of your business."
        <p></p>Normally, Amane would've eaten a boxed meal from the convenience store or something
        <p></p>premade from the supermarket, but today, he'd neglected to pick something up for
        <p></p>dinner, and he didn't feel like instant ramen, so this was all he had. It probably
        <p></p>wouldn't be enough, though, so he planned on having a snack later, too.
        <p></p>"…I guess I don't need to ask whether you can cook for yourself. It definitely doesn't
        <p></p>seem like you can, at least. And yet you're living on your own, even though you can't
        <p></p>cook or clean…" Mahiru's observation was brutally honest.
        <p></p>"Shut up. That's none of your business," Amane fired back, though he knew he couldn't
        <p></p>argue with the truth. He frowned and finished off the remainder of his jelly.
        <p></p>He'd wised up about cleaning his place a couple days ago and was definitely planning
        <p></p>to do something about it sometime soon. Ruminating on Mahiru's scolding only
        <p></p>seemed to make Amane want to do it less, however. It also made him wonder why she
        <p></p>was making such a fuss over him in the first place.
        <p></p>Mahiru just stared at Amane, then let out a soft sigh. "…Wait here," she instructed
        <p></p>before disappearing back into her own apartment.
        <p></p>"What now?" Amane grumbled as he listened to the clatter of the glass door closing
        <p></p>behind her.
        <p></p>He'd been told to wait, but he didn't know what for. Turning a puzzled gaze toward
        <p></p>Mahiru's apartment, Amane stood there obediently, but there was no immediate
        <p></p>answer.
        <p></p>It's starting to get chilly out here; I'd like to go inside, but…
        <p></p>He'd been told to stay put, so that was what he'd do. The autumn evening was colder
        <p></p>than expected, and Amane's loosely fitting, casual clothes did little to help him stay
        <p></p>warm.
        <p></p>As Amane waited, watching his deep breaths come out white in the cold, he heard the
        <p></p>electronic bell chime from his front door, announcing a visitor. It was pretty obvious
        <p></p>who it was.
        <p></p>Truly puzzled, Amane made his way toward the front door, dodging scattered clothes
        <p></p>and magazines on the floor.
        <p></p>He knew who it was without even looking through the peephole, so he slid his feet into
        <p></p>a pair of slippers, took the chain off the door, and opened it. As expected, he came faceto-face with waves of sandy-blond hair.
        <p></p>"…What are you doing?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"I couldn't stand how badly you were neglecting your health. These are just some
        <p></p>leftovers I had, but please take them," Mahiru stated plainly as she abruptly stuck a
        <p></p>hand out in front of her. In her delicate palm, somewhat smaller than Amane's own,
        <p></p>was a plastic container. He could vaguely see some sort of stewed dish through the
        <p></p>semi-transparent lid. He couldn't tell exactly what it was, however, as the container
        <p></p>had filled with steam from the warmth of the food.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to understand the confused look in Amane's eyes as he stood there
        <p></p>blinking. She let out a deep sigh. "You're not eating properly. Nutritional supplements
        <p></p>are just that—supplements. You can't live on them alone."
        <p></p>"What are you, my mom?" Amane jeered.
        <p></p>"I believe what I said is common sense. Also, shouldn't you have tidied up your room
        <p></p>by now? There still isn't any room to walk."
        <p></p>Mahiru narrowed her eyes in obvious disappointment as she looked past Amane at
        <p></p>the room beyond, and Amane's words stalled in his throat.
        <p></p>"…I have, a little."
        <p></p>"No, you haven't. Normally, people don't drop their clothes on the floor."
        <p></p>"Those just… fell there."
        <p></p>"That wouldn't happen if you washed, dried, folded, and put them away properly. Also,
        <p></p>you should bundle up your magazines after you're done reading them. That way you
        <p></p>won't slip on one and fall."
        <p></p>It wasn't that he couldn't sense the small barbs in her words, but he also understood
        <p></p>that Mahiru was, for some reason, genuinely concerned for him, so he couldn't dismiss
        <p></p>everything she was saying. After all, the clutter of magazines had almost tripped the
        <p></p>both of them up just the other night. She had a point.
        <p></p>Amane had no rebuttal. He screwed up his face, squeezed his mouth shut tight, and
        <p></p>sullenly took the container from Mahiru's hand.
        <p></p>The food suffused his palm with a welcome warmth, especially after all the time spent
        <p></p>standing on his chilly veranda.
        <p></p>"So I can eat this?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"If you don't need it, I can throw it out," Mahiru answered flatly.
        <p></p>"No, I'm grateful for it. I don't usually get to eat an angel's home cooking."
        <p></p>"…Stop calling me that, seriously."
        <p></p>Using her school nickname was a kind of petty, needling revenge for her critical
        <p></p>comments. Her feelings about the moniker were written clearly across her pale cheeks
        <p></p>as they turned red.
        <p></p>There was no doubt about it—she hated being called an angel. Were he in the same
        <p></p>position, Amane was certain he would hate it, too. That hardly needed to be said.
        <p></p>Despite understanding Mahiru's stance, Amane couldn't help but smile when he saw
        <p></p>her looking up at him with flushed cheeks and tiny, bitter tears forming.
        <p></p>"I'm not going to say I'm sorry," he declared.
        <p></p>It was clear that any further teasing would be certain to wreck what little goodwill she
        <p></p>had left for him, so Amane figured it was prudent to give it a rest.
        <p></p>We're not even that close.
        <p></p>Mahiru also seemed not to want to hear any more, and she emphasized this by clearing
        <p></p>her throat forcefully as she pulled herself together.
        <p></p>Her cheeks were still tinged with red, though, so she didn't look like much had changed.
        <p></p>"Well, thank you for this. Though, you don't really need to worry about what happened
        <p></p>before," Amane said.
        <p></p>"I don't. I considered that debt settled. This is for my own self-satisfaction… I saw that
        <p></p>you weren't taking care of yourself, and I was concerned; that's all."
        <p></p>Of course. Mahiru pitied him; that was it. There was no way to hide—she'd gotten a
        <p></p>very good look at how he lived the other night. Even now, she could see the garbage
        <p></p>piled up in the hallway behind him.
        <p></p>"You need to at least start eating proper meals and… get your life together!" she
        <p></p>scolded.
        <p></p>"Yes, Mom," Amane answered sarcastically. He was getting a little tired of listening to
        <p></p>Mahiru's nagging.
        <p></p>Amane churlishly carried the meal Mahiru had brought him back into his apartment.
        <p></p>He grabbed a pair of disposable chopsticks he'd gotten at the supermarket and sat
        <p></p>down on his living room couch, eager to sample the flavors of her cooking.
        <p></p>He remembered enjoying the rice porridge that she'd brought him before, even though
        <p></p>his sense of taste had been dulled by sickness. The slow-cooked porridge had
        <p></p>possessed a rich, comforting taste that had been gentle on his stomach. If that was any
        <p></p>indication, Mahiru's cooking was undoubtedly quite good, but now it was time to find
        <p></p>out for sure.
        <p></p>As he hastily opened the lid of the container, the savory scent of stew drifted gently up
        <p></p>at him. Various root vegetables had been cooked together with some chicken. The
        <p></p>light-colored sauce underscored the vibrant hues of carrots and green beans, all of
        <p></p>which had been cut into bite-size pieces.
        <p></p>Amane's stomach growled, reminding him that the only thing he'd had to eat was some
        <p></p>nutritional jelly. He hastily snapped his disposable chopsticks apart and brought a
        <p></p>piece of daikon radish to his mouth.
        <p></p>"Yum."
        <p></p>Amane's mouth was greeted with a complex flavor.
        <p></p>Typical of the health-conscious Mahiru, the dish was only lightly seasoned, spiced
        <p></p>mostly with dashi stock. It was immediately obvious that she hadn't used storebought, granulated dashi. Instead, she'd made it herself using with dried bonito fish
        <p></p>and kombu seaweed. The difference in taste was night and day.
        <p></p>As he chewed it thoroughly, the flavor of the dashi and the other seasonings, as well
        <p></p>as the taste of the vegetables, spread gently through his mouth. Amane had never been
        <p></p>a fan of veggies. He usually went out of his way to avoid them, but in this dish, the
        <p></p>essence of each ingredient came together in perfect harmony, and Amane happily
        <p></p>savored them all.
        <p></p>There wasn't much chicken. Perhaps Mahiru had done that on purpose as if to tell him
        <p></p>to eat more vegetables. What little meat there was had been cooked plump and juicy.
        <p></p>There was nothing to complain about there, Amane thought, aside from the quantity.
        <p></p>For something made by a high school girl, the ingredients were a little plain, but her
        <p></p>skill more than made up for it. That Amane so readily enjoyed the food was enough of
        <p></p>a testament to that fact.
        <p></p>It would have been even better with some rice, and maybe some miso soup or clear
        <p></p>broth on the side, but Amane didn't have any prepared. He was all out of rice anyway,
        <p></p>so that modest wish was not destined to be granted that night. It was too late now, but
        <p></p>he regretted not buying any instant rice packets beforehand.
        <p></p>"That angel's amazing," Amane said to himself as he devoured the perfectly seasoned
        <p></p>vegetables, chopsticks never slowing for a second.
        <p></p>To think, she's great at school, and sports, and all kinds of housework.
        <p></p>If Mahiru had been there to hear Amane's praise, she would have hated it.
        <p></p>"Here's this back. The food was good."
        <p></p>The following evening, Amane carried the borrowed container over to Mahiru's
        <p></p>apartment.
        <p></p>The boy was certainly bad at housework, but not so bad that he couldn't wash
        <p></p>something before giving it back. In his hand, he held the carefully cleaned little box,
        <p></p>knowing that it was good manners to return it only after it had been thoroughly
        <p></p>washed and dried.
        <p></p>Mahiru had appeared the moment Amane rang the doorbell without even checking to
        <p></p>see who it was, as if she'd been expecting him.
        <p></p>She was wearing a wine-colored knit dress, and when she saw her visitor, her eyes
        <p></p>narrowed gently. She quickly checked the container and said, "You washed it and
        <p></p>everything, huh? Look at you."
        <p></p>Amane frowned slightly when she praised him like a little child.
        <p></p>"Well, thank you for taking the time," Mahiru continued. "Now take this." She pressed
        <p></p>a new, warm container into Amane's hand.
        <p></p>From what he could tell, there was saute ed pork and eggplant inside. It seemed to have
        <p></p>cooled enough that the lid hadn't fogged up, for Amane could clearly spy the color of
        <p></p>eggplant, grilled pork, and sprinkled sesame seeds through the clear top. From the
        <p></p>color, he guessed the sauce was probably miso flavor. The sight of the eggplant with
        <p></p>slight scorch marks and the lustrous pork definitely roused his appetite.
        <p></p>No one would deny that it looked delicious, but Amane couldn't understand why he'd
        <p></p>been handed dinner again.
        <p></p>"No, um, I just came to return the container," he tried to explain.
        <p></p>"This is today's dinner," Mahiru answered coolly.
        <p></p>"Yeah, I get that, but…"
        <p></p>"I just want to ask: You don't have any allergies, do you? Don't get the wrong idea,
        <p></p>though. I won't be catering to your tastes or anything."
        <p></p>"I don't, but… I mean, I can't accept your food again."
        <p></p>Taking a portion of the girl's dinner for the second time in a row seemed wrong to
        <p></p>Amane. His malnourished body was grateful for the food, and Mahiru was clearly a
        <p></p>much better cook than other girls her age, and the meal he was holding was sure to be
        <p></p>delicious, but it also held no small amount of danger.
        <p></p>If someone from school saw the two of them meeting like this, it could turn into a big
        <p></p>debacle. That would be the end of Amane's quiet student life for sure.
        <p></p>These apartments were meant for single occupancy, but the rent was pretty high
        <p></p>because of the building's location and the amenities. Amane had never seen another
        <p></p>student from their school in the building—except Mahiru, of course—so he was
        <p></p>probably worrying over nothing. Even with that mild consolation, his brief meetings
        <p></p>with the angel still made him wary.
        <p></p>"I made too much, so I'm just happy to be rid of it," Mahiru explained.
        <p></p>"…In that case, I'm happy to take it. But someone might get the wrong idea, since
        <p></p>people usually do this sort of thing for someone they like…," Amane said sheepishly.
        <p></p>"And do you have the wrong idea?"
        <p></p>"Uh, I guess not."
        <p></p>One look at Mahiru's expression was enough to clear up any misconceptions about her
        <p></p>feelings toward Amane.
        <p></p>There was no way that a beautiful, talented girl like Mahiru could possibly fall for an
        <p></p>oblivious slob like Amane. Sure, a cute next-door neighbor bringing him food seemed
        <p></p>like something out of a romantic comedy, but there was no romance here—and
        <p></p>certainly no comedy. The situation was as devoid of those elements as Amane's own
        <p></p>apartment was devoid of rice.
        <p></p>What kindness existed in the angel's barbed words had been born only from pity.
        <p></p>"Well then, there's no problem, is there? And anyway, it looks like you were surviving
        <p></p>on convenience-store meals and side dishes from the supermarket," stated Mahiru.
        <p></p>"How could you tell?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"It's not hard to see that your kitchen has barely been used, and you have a ton of
        <p></p>disposable chopsticks from the convenience store and the supermarket on your desk.
        <p></p>Besides, I can tell just by looking at you. You've got an unhealthy complexion."
        <p></p>Amane's expression froze. Mahiru had gotten all that just from one visit to his
        <p></p>apartment. Everything she'd said had been spot-on; he had no room to argue.
        <p></p>"…All right, I'll be going."
        <p></p>Mahiru bowed and went back inside her apartment, having said what she'd wanted to
        <p></p>say and given him what she'd wanted to give.
        <p></p>Amane looked at the container in his hands as he listened to the jangling sound of the
        <p></p>chain on the other side of Mahiru's front door slide into place. The heat from the food
        <p></p>was beginning to warm the palms of his hands. He let out a soft sigh and returned to
        <p></p>his place.
        <p></p>As expected, the stir-fried sesame miso eggplant and pork was delicious. Amane found
        <p></p>himself wishing even more than yesterday that he'd bought some rice.
        <p></p>As time went on, Amane began swapping an empty container for a full one every day,
        <p></p>and his diet improved dramatically.
        <p></p>Mahiru's cooking was always light and healthy, and since every dish made him want
        <p></p>rice, Amane started fixing microwave packets with each meal. The angel had a variety
        <p></p>of cuisines in her repertoire: Japanese, Chinese, even Western. Each day brought
        <p></p>something new, but every single meal was delicious, and Amane developed an appetite
        <p></p>like never before.
        <p></p>Like a wild animal grown fat on handouts, Amane quickly came to rely on Mahiru's
        <p></p>charity. Even as he continued to obediently accept container after container, he knew
        <p></p>it was presumptuous to expect a meal every day. Still, he happily—and hungrily—
        <p></p>licked his chops each time.
        <p></p>"…You're looking good lately. You fix your diet or something?"
        <p></p>Itsuki took a long, hard look at Amane one day during lunch. Apparently, his complexion
        <p></p>had improved—probably because he was finally supplying his body with much-
        <p></p>needed nutrition.
        <p></p>Amane knew his friend was perceptive, and he felt a bit of a cold sweat break out as
        <p></p>he slurped the udon noodles he'd ordered for school lunch.
        <p></p>"Itsuki, you scare me," he said.
        <p></p>"Why's that? Do you mean I'm right?"
        <p></p>"Uh, well, I guess you could say I've had no choice but to reexamine my lifestyle recently."
        <p></p>Whenever Amane passed by Mahiru near their apartments, she would chide him
        <p></p>gently to take care of himself, and she was regularly sharing her dinner with him. It
        <p></p>was only natural that his life had improved. On the one hand, he wanted to call her his
        <p></p>guardian angel, but a small part of him also felt like she was meddling where it was
        <p></p>none of her business.
        <p></p>Amane had indirectly confirmed Itsuki's suspicions by dodging the question, and
        <p></p>Itsuki cackled with delighted laughter. "Yeah, I knew it. You always looked unhealthy
        <p></p>'cause the way you were living was so crappy."
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>"But what made you decide to 'reexamine your lifestyle'?"
        <p></p>"I guess I was forced to."
        <p></p>"Ah, your mom found out?"
        <p></p>"…You're not right, but you're not far off, either."
        <p></p>Mahiru really did sound like Amane's mom at times. She was much too young and too
        <p></p>cute to be a mother, though. Still, the way the girl went to such lengths to care for
        <p></p>Amane made it hard for him to refuse her.
        <p></p>"Say, Itsuki? Do I really seem that unhealthy?"
        <p></p>"Hmm… Well, to start with, you're pretty pale. I guess you're tall enough, but you're
        <p></p>gangly. You're also always shuffling around all apathetic-like, so you look like a zombie."
        <p></p>"But that's just how I look…"
        <p></p>"You think I don't know that? Try looking like one of the living for a change."
        <p></p>"Don't be absurd… Wait, but seriously… a zombie…?"
        <p></p>Amane wasn't really sure because he almost never bothered to closely check his own
        <p></p>face in the mirror, but apparently, he gave others the impression that he was barely
        <p></p>alive. If he looked half-dead even on a good day, that would explain why Mahiru had
        <p></p>been so worried about him before.
        <p></p>"You should pay a little more attention to how other people see you, Amane. You're
        <p></p>always hunched over, starin' at the ground. It makes you hard to approach, and it's not
        <p></p>like you go out of your way to get close to anybody, either. If I didn't know any better,
        <p></p>I'd say you're the very definition of a moody teenager."
        <p></p>"You sure know how to keep it casual when you're insulting a guy."
        <p></p>"Fine, fine, I won't sugarcoat it, then. You look like a corpse, and your life is a mess."
        <p></p>Itsuki continued teasing his friend, insisting that he ought to take this opportunity to
        <p></p>pay more attention to his appearance and demeanor, not to mention his health.
        <p></p>Sharply turning away, Amane replied sarcastically, "Thanks for your concern."
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 4: A Chance Encounter 
        <p></p>"Ah."
        <p></p>Amane heard a beautiful voice ring out like a bell from behind him.
        <p></p>Recently, he'd grown accustomed to hearing that voice, but only around his apartment
        <p></p>building. Now he heard it while he was standing in the sweets aisle at the neighborhood
        <p></p>supermarket.
        <p></p>Amane had never expected Mahiru to acknowledge him in public, so he turned around
        <p></p>with some bewilderment to see her standing there, eyes wide.
        <p></p>A supermarket basket hung from her arm, and inside it sat a daikon radish and some
        <p></p>tofu, as well as a package of chicken thighs and a carton of milk. These were likely the
        <p></p>ingredients for her dinner tonight.
        <p></p>This was nothing special. Amane had coincidentally stopped by the candy aisle at the
        <p></p>same time. That was all.
        <p></p>"Just so you know, this is merely a coincidence," Amane asserted. "It's not like I'm
        <p></p>stalking you or anything."
        <p></p>"I know, I know." Mahiru nodded. "We're both just here because it's the closest
        <p></p>supermarket." Before Amane had a chance to agree, he heard the girl mutter, "Really,
        <p></p>though, that's the first thing that came to mind…?" She stared down at a notebook that
        <p></p>she was carrying.
        <p></p>It was just like the meticulous Mahiru to dutifully record everything she needed.
        <p></p>Ignoring Amane in favor of her flower-patterned notebook, Mahiru brushed past the
        <p></p>sweets and began searching the condiments on display in the next aisle.
        <p></p>Something about Mahiru searching the shelves for kitchen staples and murmuring
        <p></p>things like soy sauce and mirin in her lovely voice seemed cute to Amane. It was clear
        <p></p>that the girl was in a strange kind of mood, however.
        <p></p>"Mirin is right here. Look," Amane said, pointing it out.
        <p></p>"Ah, not that—I'm looking for the low-alcohol kind. I can't buy that, since I'm underage,"
        <p></p>Mahiru replied.
        <p></p>"This is considered alcohol?"
        <p></p>"Mirin is sweet rice wine, after all. The ones that are specifically for cooking still have
        <p></p>alcohol, but they add in salt to make it gross to drink, so even underage people can buy
        <p></p>it."
        <p></p>Amane had been about to hand her a bottle of mirin when she suddenly refused it,
        <p></p>shook her head, and instead placed the low-alcohol alternative in her basket.
        <p></p>"Learn something every day…" This was all new to Amane, who did so little housework
        <p></p>that even these simple tidbits seemed revelatory. He watched Mahiru as she moved
        <p></p>quickly on down the aisle, stopping in front of a shelf full of soy sauce.
        <p></p>Mahiru frowned, as if she had only just noticed the price labels. "…Bargain price, limit
        <p></p>one bottle per person…" She had apparently been intending to buy a spare. Mahiru
        <p></p>grumbled in disappointment and turned to glance at Amane.
        <p></p>"Maybe… I could buy one, too?" Amane quickly sensed what Mahiru had been trying
        <p></p>to convey with her eyes, and with a wry smile, he picked up a bottle of soy sauce. When
        <p></p>he did, her lips formed a satisfied arch.
        <p></p>"It's helpful to have someone who understands," she said.
        <p></p>"…You're more economical than I expected," Amane commented.
        <p></p>"Well, I don't see why I shouldn't find the best prices when I can. Cut down on needless
        <p></p>expense, right?"
        <p></p>"I wonder if that's what they call a thrifty mentality. Well, as long as you're living on
        <p></p>an allowance from your parents, I guess that's for the best."
        <p></p>Amane may have technically lived alone, but in reality, his parents still supported him.
        <p></p>His family was fairly rich, and they covered the rent of his clean, safe apartment, took
        <p></p>care of his school fees, and provided him with a more-than-fair allowance. Amane had
        <p></p>never had to worry about his expenses, but he was grateful for everything his parents
        <p></p>did for him, so he tried not to waste money.
        <p></p>"…That's right. We depend on their support, so it's important to be frugal," Mahiru
        <p></p>replied matter-of-factly, taking stock of the contents of her basket. Her voice was cold,
        <p></p>like something had stolen away her warmth.
        <p></p>Amane flinched at Mahiru's flat tone, but when she looked up from her groceries, her
        <p></p>expression had returned to normal. The gloomy eyes he'd seen in that brief moment
        <p></p>were already gone.
        <p></p>"…Anyway, are you really buying that?" Mahiru asked, as if to change the subject,
        <p></p>looking at the packs of instant rice and the container of potato salad that were in the
        <p></p>basket that Amane was holding.
        <p></p>The meals that Mahiru was sharing with him were, of course, delicious, but they
        <p></p>weren't enough on their own. To compensate, Amane would pick up a staple food and
        <p></p>side salad like he'd done today.
        <p></p>"I mean, it's dinner," Amane explained.
        <p></p>"It's unhealthy," Mahiru shot back.
        <p></p>"You're so fussy. I'm buying a salad, aren't I?"
        <p></p>"A potato salad… How is your body still functioning?"
        <p></p>"Mind your own business."
        <p></p>Mahiru put wordless pressure on him, scrutinizing him with eyes that reproached him
        <p></p>and told him to eat more vegetables. Amane turned away and let Mahiru go ahead of
        <p></p>him.
        <p></p>Chatting about this and that, the two bought their respective things. Amane had started
        <p></p>to pack his purchases into a plastic bag, but Mahiru produced a reusable bag she'd
        <p></p>brought and quickly put everything into it.
        <p></p>She was truly an environmentally conscious angel.
        <p></p>Mahiru had only brought the one bag, however, and Amane was a little anxious that
        <p></p>the quantity of groceries was too much for it.
        <p></p>With the milk, soy sauce, and low-alcohol cooking mirin, that was four liters of liquid
        <p></p>altogether, and if they weighed anything like water, that meant four kilograms right
        <p></p>there. There was still the whole daikon radish and the other ingredients to consider,
        <p></p>too. The bag had to be really heavy. Everything was packed in quite neatly, but still, it
        <p></p>would surely be hard work carrying it all the way back to Amane and Mahiru's building.
        <p></p>She's been cooking for me, so she must be going through more seasonings and ingredients
        <p></p>than she normally does.
        <p></p>She's gotta be making a lot in order to split the dishes with me. The amount she gives me
        <p></p>is always nearly a whole meal's worth. Mahiru says it's all just extra, but she must be
        <p></p>making a lot of food on purpose.
        <p></p>After Mahiru had gone through so much trouble to take care of Amane, it'd wound his
        <p></p>pride if he didn't do anything to help her out now.
        <p></p>As soon as Mahiru finished packing the reusable bag, Amane took hold of the handles
        <p></p>and lifted it. It wasn't all that heavy to him, of course, but he could tell that it would
        <p></p>definitely be difficult for her to carry for very long.
        <p></p>Mahiru may have been really good at sports, but pure arm strength was an entirely
        <p></p>different matter. Surely, Amane thought, his eyes tracing her slim figure under her
        <p></p>clothing, surely there was no way that her slender arms could command the power
        <p></p>needed to lift these heavy groceries.
        <p></p>Caramel-colored eyes blinked rapidly. Mahiru looked surprised—or maybe a little
        <p></p>concerned.
        <p></p>"…I'm not stealing it or anything," Amane said in his defense.
        <p></p>"I'm not worried about that," Mahiru replied. "It's just… I can carry my own bags, you
        <p></p>know?"
        <p></p>"It'd be more charming if you'd be quiet and let me take care of you for a change,"
        <p></p>quipped Amane.
        <p></p>"That's basically saying I'm not charming," Mahiru answered flatly.
        <p></p>"Well, think about how you act at school, then compare that to how you act toward
        <p></p>me."
        <p></p>Mahiru took a step back. Maybe Amane had unknowingly hit a nerve. The version of
        <p></p>herself that she showed at school—the kind, gentle, modest girl everyone was familiar
        <p></p>with—that was not the person Amane knew. Yes, Mahiru was always kind to him, but
        <p></p>she was also far more direct. She never sugarcoated anything or hid behind niceties.
        <p></p>Everything she said to him was brief and frank.
        <p></p>Amane took advantage of Mahiru's stunned silence and briskly sauntered off toward
        <p></p>the supermarket exit, holding his schoolbag in one hand and the reusable shopping
        <p></p>bag stuffed with groceries in the other. He was leaving her behind, but he didn't care.
        <p></p>Unconcerned, he continued on as the gap between them grew wider. He didn't slow
        <p></p>down or give her a chance to catch up.
        <p></p>They had already been standing next to each other in the supermarket, after all. If they
        <p></p>walked side by side on the way home and somebody saw them, that could start rumors.
        <p></p>So really, this kind of distance was best for both of them.
        <p></p>Amane hurried on with his heavy burden while pretending not to be aware of Mahiru.
        <p></p>As he strode along, he thought he heard someone mutter "Thanks" behind him.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 5: The Angel and the Great Cleaning Campaign 
        <p></p>Amane was terrible at housework of any kind, but the thing he was worst at was cleaning.
        <p></p>Surprisingly, he actually could cook. More specifically, he could prepare something hot
        <p></p>and usually technically edible, as long as he was willing to set aside petty concerns like
        <p></p>presentation or flavor and also assumed the possibility of grievous bodily injury at
        <p></p>some point during the process. He wasn't completely incapable of preparing food.
        <p></p>Laundry was all right, too. That much was possible for anyone, even Amane. If push
        <p></p>came to shove, there was always the option of taking his clothes to a coin laundromat.
        <p></p>All it boiled down to was a matter of stuffing everything into the machine and letting
        <p></p>it run with detergent and water inside. Amane could pull that off, no problem. The one
        <p></p>thing he was absolutely hopeless with, however, was cleaning.
        <p></p>"What do I do?"
        <p></p>One weekend, Amane had finally gotten tired of listening to both Mahiru and Itsuki
        <p></p>lecture him day in and day out about cleaning his apartment and had resolved to
        <p></p>finally do something about it. The only problem was that Amane was at a complete
        <p></p>loss on how to get started.
        <p></p>He knew that this was his own fault, but the first problem was that his things were
        <p></p>piled up all over the place, and he couldn't figure out how he could even begin to get
        <p></p>them in order. Unsure of what else to do, Amane started by washing his bedsheets and
        <p></p>airing out his futon.
        <p></p>What should come next? he wondered. Clothes and magazines are scattered everywhere,
        <p></p>so there's really no room to walk.
        <p></p>One small mercy was that he always threw out any food garbage right away, so there
        <p></p>were no awful stenches or greasy stains. It was simply an enormous amount of clutter
        <p></p>—enough that it seemed like an insurmountable problem.
        <p></p>As Amane sighed softly at the mountain of work before him, the doorbell rang. He let
        <p></p>out a little gasp.
        <p></p>Rather than a regular visitor, he had begun to think of his neighbor more like a delivery
        <p></p>person, a blessing from above who just handed over gifts and then left. As he stood
        <p></p>before his messy room, however, Mahiru seemed like a savior.
        <p></p>Amane scrambled for his front door but couldn't find his footing. He stumbled, caught
        <p></p>himself, and carefully crept the rest of the way to the door with one hand pressed
        <p></p>against the wall for balance.
        <p></p>"Sorry, I wanted to pick up my container a little earlier today… What are you doing?"
        <p></p>Mahiru asked when Amane opened the door.
        <p></p>"…I was trying to clean," he admitted.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked at Amane, still off-balance, with a rather astonished expression.
        <p></p>"I heard a loud noise just now," she said.
        <p></p>"…I almost fell."
        <p></p>"I bet you did. You haven't even begun to clean, have you?"
        <p></p>"I wasn't sure how to start."
        <p></p>"I can tell."
        <p></p>Amane grimaced at Mahiru's comment. It was no less candid than usual, and Amane
        <p></p>really couldn't think of anything to justify his lack of progress. Besides, he knew that
        <p></p>if he got sulky now and lashed out, he wouldn't be able to get her advice on how to go
        <p></p>about cleaning his apartment. The trouble was that he wasn't sure how exactly to ask
        <p></p>for Mahiru's help.
        <p></p>I was hoping for some cleaning tips, but I wonder if she'll actually give me any advice…
        <p></p>Amane hesitated when he saw that Mahiru was peering past him at the clutter beyond.
        <p></p>Her eyes conveyed her shock at the disastrous scene behind him. It truly must've been
        <p></p>an awful sight.
        <p></p>"Unbelievable… I'll help you clean your apartment."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>Even Amane knew that it would be too shameless to ask Mahiru to help him clean.
        <p></p>That's why he'd only been planning to see if she had any suggestions. Never had he
        <p></p>dared to imagine that Mahiru would come right out and offer to help.
        <p></p>"I hate the idea that the apartment next to mine is so filthy." Such scathing words, but
        <p></p>again, Amane could offer no argument. "You must think it's so easy to live alone, but
        <p></p>you can't even clean up after yourself. Worse, you act like it's no problem, like
        <p></p>everything will sort itself out eventually, but it clearly hasn't. Why don't you stop and
        <p></p>take a moment to look at yourself?"
        <p></p>Amane was at a loss for words. His mother had always told him that if he was diligent
        <p></p>about cleaning regularly, it would be easy, but he'd ignored her, and this was the result.
        <p></p>He was fully aware that he was suffering the consequences of his own actions.
        <p></p>"Look, as long as you keep up with routine cleaning, your place won't get this bad
        <p></p>again. It's obvious that you have some terrible habits," Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"…You're absolutely right," agreed Amane.
        <p></p>He couldn't get angry with her. He already owed her so much, and she'd been so kind
        <p></p>to him. Besides, everything she was saying about his past behavior was true. He had
        <p></p>underestimated how difficult living alone would be, and he really did just sort of
        <p></p>assume that everything would somehow work itself out, and this was the result.
        <p></p>Amane could only nod solemnly at Mahiru's words.
        <p></p>"Well, is it all right if I start with this room?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"…Is it all right with you?" Amane answered with a question of his own.
        <p></p>"I'm the one who's offering, so of course it's all right. I'm going to go get ready, so while
        <p></p>I do, if you have anything you don't want me to see, or any valuables, please put them
        <p></p>in a closet and lock them up."
        <p></p>"I'm not worried about that."
        <p></p>Amane refused to even entertain the idea that someone who had been so kind to him,
        <p></p>even despite her sharp words, might steal from him. Not to mention that Mahiru was
        <p></p>far too good-hearted to ever harm another person like that.
        <p></p>"…You're not?" she inquired.
        <p></p>"There's no way that you would do something like that," Amane replied.
        <p></p>"No, that's not what I… Look, aren't you worried that I might see something that, as a
        <p></p>boy, you'd rather hide?"
        <p></p>"Ah… uh, well, unfortunately I don't happen to have any such things."
        <p></p>"Well, in that case, it's fine, then. All right, I'm going to go change clothes and fetch
        <p></p>some cleaning supplies. I don't take cleaning lightly, you know."
        <p></p>Mahiru returned to her apartment, and Amane watched her go with a wry smile.
        <p></p>She came back wearing different clothes: a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo
        <p></p>pants. The T-shirt closely followed the lines of her body, the delicate fabric bringing
        <p></p>the curves and edges into full relief. Mahiru's long hair had been skillfully gathered
        <p></p>into a perfectly round bun, and Amane felt strangely uncomfortable being able to see
        <p></p>the white nape of her neck.
        <p></p>Previously, he had only ever seen her in dresses and skirts, and he found there was
        <p></p>something refreshing about this look. Amane had thought before that boyish clothes
        <p></p>like this probably wouldn't suit her well, but he had clearly been wrong. He was
        <p></p>beginning to realize that beautiful girls looked good in whatever they put on.
        <p></p>This new outfit looked comfortable for moving around the house, but it was also a look
        <p></p>that Mahiru could've worn around town. Amane never would've imagined that these
        <p></p>were clothes that she was okay with getting dirtied.
        <p></p>"You don't mind if those get messed up?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"I was planning to throw these out soon anyway, so it's fine if they get a bit dirty."
        <p></p>Mahiru scanned the cataclysm that was Amane's apartment and sighed softly. "I'm
        <p></p>only going to say this once: We're going to clean thoroughly, got it?"
        <p></p>"…I understand."
        <p></p>"Good, then let's get to it. I'm not going to go easy on you, and I won't let this end
        <p></p>halfway through. I assume you have no objections?" Mahiru had posed the question
        <p></p>so forcefully that Amane could do nothing but sheepishly reply in the affirmative.
        <p></p>So began the great battle to clean Amane's apartment. A battle spearheaded by an
        <p></p>angel.
        <p></p>"First things first, let's toss any clothes into the laundry basket. Usually when you
        <p></p>clean, you work from top to bottom, but we have to handle the clutter on the floor first
        <p></p>before we can run the vacuum cleaner. Before we start the wash, we can divide the
        <p></p>clothes into different loads, since there are too many to wash at once. Do you want to
        <p></p>split them into things you wear and things you don't wear? Or do you want to wash
        <p></p>everything?"
        <p></p>"Just do it however you like…," replied Amane. It seemed so obvious to him now. Of
        <p></p>course they had to clear the floor before trying to do anything else.
        <p></p>"…There isn't any underwear out here or anything, right?"
        <p></p>"Those are in my dresser, as you would expect."
        <p></p>"That's fine, then. We can probably put off washing clothes for now, since even if we
        <p></p>wash and dry them, we'll kick up dust by cleaning and just end up having to do them
        <p></p>again. If you're not in a hurry, you can do the laundry after we finish cleaning."
        <p></p>"Okay."
        <p></p>"…Now, regarding the magazines. Really, the only thing to do is to throw them out. I
        <p></p>suppose it's a bit of a different story if you're collecting them, but from the way you
        <p></p>keep them piled up everywhere, I doubt that's the case. If you do want to hold on to
        <p></p>some part of one, tear out the page and put it in a scrapbook, then dispose of the rest.
        <p></p>Tie up any magazines you're getting rid of and put them out for collection."
        <p></p>Mahiru set about the task of cleaning right away, directing Amane to put his discarded
        <p></p>clothing into the laundry basket as she gathered up every last magazine. She told him
        <p></p>to speak now if there were any that Amane wanted to keep, but there weren't any in
        <p></p>particular that he needed, so he simply shook his head. Having received the answer
        <p></p>she required, Mahiru skillfully tied up the bundle using some plastic cord that she had
        <p></p>apparently brought with her.
        <p></p>"When you're finished gathering the clothes, please go through the other assorted
        <p></p>clutter and decide whether to throw anything out. All these different things on the
        <p></p>floor: same as before, sort them into what you need to keep and what you don't. Then
        <p></p>put the latter in the trash. Got it?"
        <p></p>"…Uh-huh," Amane answered meekly.
        <p></p>"If you have a problem with taking orders, you'd better tell me now."
        <p></p>"No, I don't, but… I was just thinking about how quick you're doing all of this."
        <p></p>"If I don't, we'll run out of time. It's total chaos in here, after all."
        <p></p>"You're right."
        <p></p>Even though it was the weekend, time was limited. If they were going to run the
        <p></p>vacuum, it would have to be during the day, considering that the noise would be a
        <p></p>nuisance to the neighbors. Since Mahiru knew that it would take a lot of effort to get
        <p></p>the place to a state where they could vacuum, she was working to tidy up as quickly
        <p></p>as possible.
        <p></p>One part of Amane felt bad for letting her do so much. On the other hand, under
        <p></p>Mahiru's direction, more and more of the floor began to appear for the first time in a
        <p></p>long while.
        <p></p>"Professor Shiina…," Amane muttered.
        <p></p>"If you're going to ask for guidance from me like I'm a teacher, first learn by imitating.
        <p></p>I'm not going to sort through your personal effects, so please be diligent and keep only
        <p></p>what you really need," Mahiru instructed.
        <p></p>"Yes, sir."
        <p></p>"Please don't address me as a man."
        <p></p>The angel nonchalantly returned Amane's jabs as she skillfully cleared up more of the
        <p></p>clutter with a serious expression the whole time.
        <p></p>Amane had a bad habit of hoarding useless junk, and he was both grateful for Mahiru's
        <p></p>decisiveness and envious of it. Here she was, in a stranger's apartment, picking
        <p></p>through the mess without hesitation. She really was the spitting image of an angel.
        <p></p>Mahiru was so efficient that she could have easily cleaned up the whole place by
        <p></p>herself had she wanted to. However, likely because she was in such a hurry, she got
        <p></p>careless about watching her footing. There was no doubt that it was Amane's fault for
        <p></p>leaving it on the floor, but Mahiru slipped on a piece of discarded clothing and lost her
        <p></p>balance.
        <p></p>The instant a small "Ah!" escaped Mahiru's mouth, Amane dived across the room,
        <p></p>aiming for the spot where he thought Mahiru would most likely fall.
        <p></p>A light, sweet fragrance mixed with the musty smell of the dust that had been kicked
        <p></p>up in the panic.
        <p></p>Amane landed on his backside, leaving his rear end to suffer a dull sting, but it was
        <p></p>tolerable. He groaned just a bit as he felt the weight of Mahiru pressing down on him.
        <p></p>She must be happy that I caught her right away.
        <p></p>"…Fujimiya?" Mahiru looked up at him. She didn't seem angry, but she didn't seem
        <p></p>particularly happy about the situation, either. Mostly, she just sounded surprised. "I
        <p></p>can accept the blame for falling, but this is exactly why you must tidy up, because
        <p></p>otherwise things like this are bound to happen."
        <p></p>"I'm really sorry, honestly… You're not hurt, are you?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"I'm fine. Thanks for going out of your way to catch me. I'm sorry, too."
        <p></p>"No, it's all my fault…"
        <p></p>Amane wouldn't have been able to bear it if Mahiru had gotten hurt while helping him,
        <p></p>especially considering she was already sharing meals with him. That would've been
        <p></p>absolutely unforgivable; he wouldn't have even been able to look her in the eye.
        <p></p>If he needed to, he was considering kneeling and asking for forgiveness, but Mahiru
        <p></p>didn't seem too upset over her tumble.
        <p></p>"We're cleaning up so that things like this don't happen anymore, understand?"
        <p></p>"Yeah. I'm really very sorry."
        <p></p>"It's fine; you don't need to apologize. I'm helping you because I feel like it, after all."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked just a little bit flustered as she gazed up at Amane.
        <p></p>Amane suddenly realized how close they were and was aware of her pressing against
        <p></p>him. For a boy who basically never interacted with girls on a regular basis, this was a
        <p></p>heart-pounding situation. Even though neither of them had any romantic feelings for
        <p></p>the other, something felt very wrong about it somehow.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem to be conscious of the situation, so Amane gently grabbed her
        <p></p>shoulder and pushed her off of him; then he stood up before the awkwardness could
        <p></p>show on his face.
        <p></p>"…Should we… keep cleaning?" he managed after a moment.
        <p></p>"Yes, that's a good idea," Mahiru replied. Fortunately for Amane, she appeared to be
        <p></p>oblivious to his trembling as she grabbed the hand Amane extended and rose to her
        <p></p>feet.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed unaware of how closely she'd been pressed up against him, because
        <p></p>she just maintained her usual expression. Amane figured that a girl like Mahiru
        <p></p>must've been used to the attention of a lot of boys. Surely a little contact like that
        <p></p>wouldn't be enough to unnerve her like it did him.
        <p></p>Smiling wryly at Mahiru's demeanor, Amane decided it would be wrong to leave
        <p></p>everything up to her and returned to cleaning with newfound resolve. Even though
        <p></p>the task was wholly unfamiliar, he did his best to struggle through.
        <p></p>"…You are full of surprises."
        <p></p>Amane was too focused on his work to notice the quiet words that escaped Mahiru's
        <p></p>lips, nor did he see that her ears, hidden by her straw-colored hair, had turned slightly
        <p></p>red.
        <p></p>"…Whew, now, this is clean."
        <p></p>In the end, it had taken the pair the entire day to clean Amane's apartment.
        <p></p>Several hours were spent tidying up the clutter on his floor, and then, between
        <p></p>washing the clothes, dusting the shelves and light fixtures, scrubbing the windows,
        <p></p>and vacuuming, the entire day had flown by before they knew it.
        <p></p>The sun had been visible when Mahiru came over, but it had long since set by now,
        <p></p>proof of just how long she and Amane had been working.
        <p></p>It had certainly been no small task, but those efforts were not without results. Amane's
        <p></p>apartment was so clean that he barely recognized it. There was no unnecessary clutter,
        <p></p>and he could see the floor! Once-dirty windowpanes and frames didn't have a single
        <p></p>speck of dirt on them. The lights, too, shone brighter now that they had been dusted.
        <p></p>The place was finally clean. Without all the junk crowding every surface, it actually
        <p></p>looked to be quite a comfortable space.
        <p></p>"To think that it took us a whole day," Mahiru observed.
        <p></p>"Guess that's what it takes when it's such a mess…," Amane answered.
        <p></p>"But it was your mess."
        <p></p>"R-right you are."
        <p></p>Amane verbally prostrated himself before his angelic savior, who had taken mercy on
        <p></p>him. Mahiru, who had wasted one of her precious weekend days helping him, finished
        <p></p>tying up a garbage bag with a beleaguered look. She didn't seem upset, but a hint of
        <p></p>fatigue showed on her face, though it was mixed with a sense of accomplishment. That
        <p></p>was only natural, since she had been working all day.
        <p></p>After everything that had transpired, Amane would have been ashamed to simply let
        <p></p>Mahiru go make dinner. It'd be unforgivable to expect her to do any more work,
        <p></p>whether she shared a portion of her cooking with him today or not.
        <p></p>"Now that it's evening, I don't feel like going shopping, so I'm going to order a pizza or
        <p></p>something. Please let me treat you today. After all, you've been giving me all kinds of
        <p></p>food and stuff," Amane offered.
        <p></p>"Oh, but—," Mahiru started, but she was quickly cut off.
        <p></p>"If you don't want to eat with me, I'll order one for you, and you can take it home."
        <p></p>This gesture was more about showing gratitude than trying to get Mahiru to eat with
        <p></p>him, so if she wanted to eat alone, Amane didn't mind.
        <p></p>"…That's not what I meant. It's just… I was surprised, because I've never ordered
        <p></p>pizza."
        <p></p>"Huh, you've never ordered pizza?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, I live alone, but I've never ordered pizza… I've made it myself, though."
        <p></p>"It's amazing that you would even think to make it," Amane exclaimed.
        <p></p>Normally, if someone decided they wanted pizza, the three options were to buy a
        <p></p>ready-made one at the store, get it delivered, or go eat it in a restaurant. He was sure
        <p></p>that there were very few people who would think to go through the long, laborious
        <p></p>process of making one from scratch.
        <p></p>"Well, there's nothing strange about ordering pizza for delivery," Amane asserted. "I
        <p></p>do it all the time myself: order delivery or go to a family restaurant solo… you know,
        <p></p>like most people."
        <p></p>"I've actually never been to one of those, either," Mahiru admitted.
        <p></p>"Now, that is rare. I go alone pretty often, and my parents go to restaurants whenever
        <p></p>they don't feel like cooking. I guess your parents aren't the type to eat out often, huh?"
        <p></p>"…In our house, the help made the meals."
        <p></p>"The help? Damn, you must be really rich."
        <p></p>Finding out that Mahiru was fabulously wealthy explained a lot. It certainly cleared up
        <p></p>why Mahiru's mannerisms were so graceful and refined—and why her clothes and
        <p></p>possessions were always top quality. Even the girl's gait seemed to speak of an affluent
        <p></p>upbringing.
        <p></p>At Amane's words, Mahiru broke into a thin smile. "You're right; I think I am
        <p></p>comparatively well-off."
        <p></p>Quickly, Amane began to regret what he'd said, realizing that Mahiru's smile was not
        <p></p>one of delight or pride but rather a display of self-mockery. It seemed that her family
        <p></p>was an area of discussion that was better left alone, and Amane didn't plan to pry any
        <p></p>further.
        <p></p>Everybody has a thing or two they'd rather not talk about. It's only polite to respect that,
        <p></p>especially with people you don't know very well.
        <p></p>"Well, then this will be an interesting experience, won't it? Here, order what you like."
        <p></p>Dropping the topic of Mahiru's parents, Amane showed her a menu for a pizza place
        <p></p>Amane occasionally ordered from. Out of all the places that delivered, it was the best.
        <p></p>Their pizza was no match for one cooked in an authentic wood-fired oven, of course,
        <p></p>but they did offer a wide variety of toppings. Their choices ranged from the standard
        <p></p>fare to stuff more suited to little kids, so Amane figured that there was sure to be
        <p></p>something that would appeal to Mahiru's tastes.
        <p></p>Mahiru accepted both the change of subject and the pizza menu. She immediately
        <p></p>began poring over the list of options, her luminous brown eyes drawn to the many
        <p></p>colorful photos of different pizzas. Her eyes weren't usually very expressive, but now
        <p></p>they shimmered vividly.
        <p></p>She must really be looking forward to this, Amane thought.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed a bit nervous, but after considering it for a little while, she pointed out
        <p></p>a party pizza with four types of toppings and said hesitantly, "All right, this looks good."
        <p></p>She turned an expectant gaze to Amane.
        <p></p>With a slight smile, Amane nodded, picked up his phone, and dialed the number
        <p></p>printed on the menu. Mahiru's eyes sparkled with anticipation.
        <p></p>An hour later, their pizza arrived. Mahiru dug in without hesitation. The pizza was
        <p></p>divided into sections to allow the different flavors to be sampled on their own, and
        <p></p>she'd hesitated a little over which one to try first but finally decided to start with a
        <p></p>piece covered with a hearty helping of bacon and sausage.
        <p></p>Amane was not surprised when Mahiru nibbled at her slice with small, delicate bites.
        <p></p>He supposed her refined upbringing had taught her to eat everything with poise and
        <p></p>grace, even delivery pizza.
        <p></p>Watching Mahiru gave Amane a warm feeling inside, like he was watching a small, cute
        <p></p>animal. She was strangely adorable as her eyes closed and her expression relaxed a
        <p></p>little while she chewed on the stretchy cheese. Usually, the girl appeared so mature; in
        <p></p>this moment, however, she finally looked her age.
        <p></p>Amane quelled an intense urge to pat Mahiru's head as she enjoyed the pizza with
        <p></p>little, mincing bites.
        <p></p>"…What?" she asked.
        <p></p>"Nothing, you just look like you're enjoying it," Amane replied.
        <p></p>"Please don't stare at me so much."
        <p></p>The frown she cast at Amane was anything but cute, however.
        <p></p>"…Geez, you've really got no charm."
        <p></p>"Well, that suits me fine. If I were to act like I always do at school, you'd say I was
        <p></p>making you uncomfortable."
        <p></p>"Yeah, I guess that's true. I'm more familiar with this version of you than the school
        <p></p>version."
        <p></p>At school, Amane barely ever even saw Mahiru, and they had certainly never spoken
        <p></p>there. He only occasionally caught a glimpse of her, and she always wore that same,
        <p></p>impenetrable smile that she showed to everyone.
        <p></p>Here, he got to see beyond that layer. This has to be the real Mahiru, Amane thought.
        <p></p>At school, she always adopted her fake, public persona.
        <p></p>"As far as I'm concerned," he continued, "I never get tired of this version."
        <p></p>"The version with no charm?"
        <p></p>"Don't hold a grudge… You know, how do I put this…? I can never tell what you're
        <p></p>thinking when you're at school."
        <p></p>"Mostly about my schedule and my classes, I suppose."
        <p></p>"So even you can be clueless once in a while, huh?"
        <p></p>Amane had meant to say that Mahiru always looked like she had some secret on her
        <p></p>mind, but Mahiru apparently took his words at face value. She looked at him with a
        <p></p>subtle protest in her eyes, as though she had meant something else entirely.
        <p></p>"I, uh, didn't mean it like that," Amane quickly added. "It's just… You don't show what
        <p></p>you're thinking. All I meant was that it's easier to be around someone who's honest
        <p></p>about their feelings, even if they're a little rude, than someone who you can never
        <p></p>read."
        <p></p>"…Do you think how I behave at school is bad?" Mahiru asked directly.
        <p></p>"Well, I can't really hate on it, since it's probably the secret to your success. I just
        <p></p>wonder if you ever get tired of it," Amane said.
        <p></p>"Not really. I've been acting like that since I was little."
        <p></p>"Hard-core, huh?"
        <p></p>If she'd been keeping up this act since childhood, spending her whole life trying to be
        <p></p>the perfect young woman everyone expected her to be, Amane could understand how
        <p></p>it would definitely be difficult for her to set that persona aside.
        <p></p>Amane had been able to infer a little bit about Mahiru's home life, but he knew that
        <p></p>there was no way he could ask her more about it.
        <p></p>"Well, isn't it nice to have a place where you can relax? And now you've even got a
        <p></p>buddy to chill with."
        <p></p>"Honestly, I don't find you relaxing at all. You make my stomach turn in knots," Mahiru
        <p></p>stated coldly.
        <p></p>"I'm… sorry?" Amane apologized, a little dumbstruck.
        <p></p>Mahiru gave an exaggerated shrug and let out a strange little laugh.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 6: A Visit from a Friend 
        <p></p>After the day-long cleanup, Amane felt like the wall between Mahiru and him had
        <p></p>become ever-so-slightly thinner, but that didn't necessarily mean they had become
        <p></p>much closer.
        <p></p>They still had absolutely zero contact at school; they would make small talk sometimes
        <p></p>when he went to get his portion of dinner from her, but that was all.
        <p></p>Just the other day, Mahiru had scolded Amane, telling him that he had to keep his
        <p></p>apartment tidy. Her words were definitely stern, but they also made it clear that she
        <p></p>actually did care about him, at least a bit.
        <p></p>Since Amane was receiving frequent reminders and tips on cleaning, his apartment
        <p></p>remained as nice as it had been when he and Mahiru had finished tidying up the place.
        <p></p>"Wow, it really is clean." That was the first thing Itsuki said when he came over on a
        <p></p>day off. He muttered in an astonished voice when he saw the drastic transformation
        <p></p>the living room had undergone.
        <p></p>"I never thought your place could look this good. It was so dirty. I remember I helped
        <p></p>you pick up stuff once before, but it was a wreck the very next day."
        <p></p>"Give it a rest," Amane shot back at his friend.
        <p></p>"No, but seriously, think about it. What's the longest number of days you've gone
        <p></p>without dropping something on your floor?"
        <p></p>"This is easily a new record. I've kept it going for two weeks."
        <p></p>"Two weeks?! That's it? That's nothing to be proud of, you know?"
        <p></p>Amane scowled a little. He was now keenly aware that normally, people did not leave
        <p></p>their things lying around on the floor. Still, he knew that Itsuki was only speaking from
        <p></p>a place of kindness and common sense, so Amane couldn't say much. After all, Itsuki
        <p></p>had helped him out, too, long before Mahiru ever had, so Amane knew he shouldn't
        <p></p>act like a jerk.
        <p></p>Itsuki smiled cheerfully at Amane's sullen silence. "Hey, I guess if your apartment's
        <p></p>this clean, I could even bring Chi over."
        <p></p>"No way; why should I have to watch you two flirting in my own home?"
        <p></p>"No need to be shy, buddy."
        <p></p>"Don't turn my place into your hangout!"
        <p></p>Why should I have to watch my friend and his girlfriend getting all lovey-dovey?
        <p></p>Amane wished Itsuki could understand his position and appreciate what kind of
        <p></p>torture it was like to have to watch a sickeningly sweet couple flirting all the time. He
        <p></p>knew that Itsuki was just joking about bringing Chi over, but even so, Amane didn't
        <p></p>find it very amusing that he constantly had front-row seats to their cloying relationship.
        <p></p>"Relax, it was just a joke. Anyway, now that you've finally got the place clean, don't go
        <p></p>messing it up again, you hear?"
        <p></p>"I've got it under control," Amane assured.
        <p></p>"Someone like you… Well, whatever. Just make sure you get in the habit of putting
        <p></p>things away after you take them out."
        <p></p>"Are you my mom…?"
        <p></p>"Now, Amane, dearie, you have to be diligent about cleaning your room!" Itsuki mocked.
        <p></p>"That's so creepy; you sound so much like my mom, it's scary!"
        <p></p>Amane felt a shiver rocket down his back when Itsuki scolded him in a forced falsetto.
        <p></p>He was sure Itsuki had never even met his mother, but still, the impression had hit a
        <p></p>nerve. Itsuki's impersonation of a lady wasn't particularly soothing, either. Amane
        <p></p>stuck out his tongue at him, and Itsuki cackled with amusement.
        <p></p>"Is that what your mom's like, Amane? Because mine is really cold toward me…"
        <p></p>"Actually, I'm jealous. My mom bugs me whenever she gets the chance."
        <p></p>"She sounds like a mom who really cares about her son."
        <p></p>"I think she's just overly attached…"
        <p></p>"No, I'm sure she has to look after you because you're such a slob."
        <p></p>"Oh, shut up. I mean it, you know, that my mom is too clingy."
        <p></p>Perhaps because Amane was an only child, his mother was always fussing over him.
        <p></p>She didn't exactly spoil him, but she did poke her nose around in his business and read
        <p></p>too much into things. Amane certainly didn't hate her, but she made him uncomfortable
        <p></p>at times.
        <p></p>His mother had given him all sorts of instructions when he'd left home to live on his
        <p></p>own and attend high school, and sometimes she would show up to check on him
        <p></p>without warning. The pop-ins could be pretty awful.
        <p></p>"Well, doesn't that just show how much she treasures you, Amane?"
        <p></p>"And her love is a heavy burden."
        <p></p>"Oh, I give up. You're the kind of guy who never appreciates what he's got till it's gone."
        <p></p>"You talk like you've got it all figured out, but don't you have your own problems
        <p></p>dealing with that kind of meddling?"
        <p></p>"Ha-ha! It's Chi, man; what else can I do?" Itsuki had all sorts of issues when it came
        <p></p>to his father and his girlfriend, so his lecture really didn't have much weight behind it.
        <p></p>Even so, Amane knew there was some truth to what his friend was saying, so he didn't
        <p></p>argue any further.
        <p></p>Itsuki sighed quietly, as if to tell Amane to let him worry about his own problems. His
        <p></p>expression remained cheerful and carefree, however. "I'll mess up anybody who
        <p></p>interferes with me and Chi!" Itsuki said, declaring something a little unsettling.
        <p></p>"Anyway, I'll figure out something for my dad situation, so it's all good. For the time
        <p></p>being, how 'bout you sort your life out, Amane?"
        <p></p>Itsuki laughed loudly, and Amane responded by making a sour face. "I know that; you
        <p></p>don't have to tell me." He smiled secretly to himself, however, thinking how he'd heard
        <p></p>that before from another person recently.
        <p></p>Itsuki had come to visit Amane's apartment in order to see how he was living. Well,
        <p></p>actually, he'd mostly come to hang out and mess around, so their discussion about the
        <p></p>state of the room quickly wrapped up, and before long, they were playing a video
        <p></p>game. Their initial intention had been to study for a test the next week, but that notion
        <p></p>had been quickly discarded.
        <p></p>"Careful with the health packs; we're gonna run out," Amane said.
        <p></p>"We'll think of something; it'll be fine," Itsuki answered.
        <p></p>"Not at this level it won't…"
        <p></p>As Amane pondered how best to deal with his less cautious co-op player, the sound of
        <p></p>the doorbell rang through the room and immediately gave rise to a different worry.
        <p></p>"Hmm? A visitor?"
        <p></p>Itsuki looked up, too, after pausing the game. He knew that Amane had never really
        <p></p>told anyone else where he lived, and that he didn't have any friends who might visit
        <p></p>him at home, besides Itsuki himself. More importantly, any regular visitor would have
        <p></p>been stopped at the lobby downstairs anyway, so a page should have come through
        <p></p>the intercom.
        <p></p>"I don't really know, but it must be a neighbor, right? Distributing a community notice
        <p></p>or something," Amane fibbed, knowing quite well who it likely was.
        <p></p>"Ah, gotcha," Itsuki answered.
        <p></p>"I'll just be a minute."
        <p></p>Amane did his best to dispel Itsuki's suspicions and hurried toward the front door,
        <p></p>struggling to hide the twitch in his face that might give him away. He was lucky that
        <p></p>Mahiru hadn't called out to him after ringing the buzzer.
        <p></p>He opened the door quickly, not bothering to check who it was, and slipped through
        <p></p>the small opening to get outside where he couldn't be seen. Amane made sure to close
        <p></p>the door behind himself.
        <p></p>Just as he'd suspected, it was Mahiru standing there, blinking in surprise at Amane,
        <p></p>who must have appeared to have been acting very unusual.
        <p></p>Immediately, he pressed an index finger to his lips and shushed Mahiru. "…Please
        <p></p>speak softly. Itsuki is here."
        <p></p>"Itsuki?" she asked.
        <p></p>"My friend. He came over to play games."
        <p></p>"Ah, okay."
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded in understanding of Amane's secretive behavior, then passed him a
        <p></p>food container as she did every day without bothering to question him any further.
        <p></p>Inside was a type of stew called oden, the perfect dish for the season now that the
        <p></p>weather had gotten cold. Mahiru had probably been preparing it since morning. Amane
        <p></p>accepted it with gratitude and let out a soft sigh as he looked at Mahiru. There was
        <p></p>really no reason she ought to be doing this every day.
        <p></p>"Look, I really appreciate what you do, but… I don't have a lot of time. Sorry," Amane
        <p></p>apologized.
        <p></p>"I wasn't waiting to be thanked or anything… I'm glad, you know, that we cleaned up
        <p></p>enough that you can invite friends over," Mahiru answered.
        <p></p>"I guess I should kneel down and thank you."
        <p></p>"No way; don't do that."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked at him with astonishment in her eyes. Perhaps she thought getting
        <p></p>Amane to do something like that would make her akin to a tyrant. Amane smiled wryly.
        <p></p>There had been a bit of earnestness in his statement, because he truly was indebted
        <p></p>to her. She'd done so much for him that he really ought to be on his knees. Amane
        <p></p>couldn't reconcile continuing to accept all the food for free, so he decided that he
        <p></p>wanted to discuss paying her for the meals at some later date.
        <p></p>"Well, if your friend is here, I suppose you can't talk for too long. Excuse me."
        <p></p>"…You're always helping me out. I'll make sure to keep this secret from Itsuki."
        <p></p>"Please do."
        <p></p>"I mean, even if I told him everything, he probably won't believe me."
        <p></p>"I suppose not."
        <p></p>Mahiru's honest confirmation raised some complex feelings for Amane, but he knew
        <p></p>she was right. If he was in Itsuki's shoes and someone told him that Mahiru Shiina had
        <p></p>been making meals for him daily, he definitely wouldn't believe them. Anyone would
        <p></p>dismiss such a claim as a fantasy.
        <p></p>That was how out of reach this angel was.
        <p></p>Normally, it would be impossible to imagine Mahiru treating even a handsome,
        <p></p>superior man to her home cooking, let alone a mediocre and slovenly guy like Amane.
        <p></p>Hell would sooner freeze over.
        <p></p>"…Can I ask you one thing?" Amane called.
        <p></p>"What is it?" Mahiru stopped before entering her apartment.
        <p></p>"What good does it do you to keep sharing your meals with me?"
        <p></p>Typically, people didn't give away food for free—they expected something in return.
        <p></p>Amane probably wouldn't have thought about doing the same for Mahiru if their
        <p></p>positions had been reversed. Even though he didn't believe for a moment that there
        <p></p>was even the slightest possibility that she had feelings for him, he couldn't help but
        <p></p>wonder.
        <p></p>At Amane's question, Mahiru gaze wandered upward as if she was giving it a bit of
        <p></p>thought herself, then, without any change to her expression, answered, "My own selfsatisfaction. There's nothing more to it. It's just as easy for me to cook for two people
        <p></p>as it is for one, and I guess I simply like treating people."
        <p></p>"So it's because you like to cook?"
        <p></p>"Well, there's that, too. I think it's also because I can give you food without you getting
        <p></p>any weird ideas, and you'll genuinely tell me that my cooking's tasty without any
        <p></p>ulterior motives. Plus, it's satisfying for me because I was concerned after seeing your
        <p></p>eating habits."
        <p></p>"…Is that how it is?" Amane pressed, just the slightest bit disappointed.
        <p></p>"That's how it is. So don't worry about it. Just think of it as… a sudden bout of good
        <p></p>fortune."
        <p></p>"Yes, ma'am."
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem like she was going to give him any more of an answer than that,
        <p></p>and after bowing courteously, she said "Pardon me" and returned to her own apartment.
        <p></p>"I guess that's how it goes," Amane mumbled to himself. "I still don't think it's right for
        <p></p>her to give it to me for free, though." He opened the door back into his own place.
        <p></p>"Who was it?" Itsuki asked.
        <p></p>"My neighbor. She gave me some of her dinner. I'm gonna put it in the fridge, so don't
        <p></p>restart the game without me," Amane replied.
        <p></p>"Ah, sorry, I already beat the boss."
        <p></p>"You gotta be kidding me."
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 7: The Angel’s Injury and a Show of Gratitude 
        <p></p>Every day on his way home, Amane passed the park where he and Mahiru had properly
        <p></p>met for the first time.
        <p></p>The building where Amane lived was less of a family-use apartment complex and more
        <p></p>aimed at single people and couples, so there were few children around, and the
        <p></p>surrounding apartment buildings were much the same.
        <p></p>Tucked away and out of sight, the little park close to Amane's building was often
        <p></p>deserted. It was in that little park devoid of children, Amane saw Mahiru for the
        <p></p>second time.
        <p></p>"What are you doing in a place like this?" he asked.
        <p></p>"…Nothing." Mahiru was sitting on a bench with straight posture and didn't budge at
        <p></p>all even after she recognized Amane and looked him over.
        <p></p>In contrast to the first time the two had met there, this time they were already
        <p></p>acquainted and were on speaking terms. That had made it easier for Amane to call to
        <p></p>Mahiru, but the girl's voice had still been stiff when she answered. It didn't seem like
        <p></p>Mahiru was on guard, as she had been during their first encounter. This was something
        <p></p>different. Amane could tell that Mahiru was being careful not to let something show
        <p></p>on her face.
        <p></p>"Come on, if it was nothing, you wouldn't be sitting here making that face. Did
        <p></p>something happen?" Amane inquired.
        <p></p>"…Not really…" Mahiru looked, as she had before when she was on the swing in the
        <p></p>rainstorm, like she was lost and didn't know what to do. Seeing her like that worried
        <p></p>Amane, but Mahiru didn't seem keen to speak on the matter.
        <p></p>Though he was bound by their tacit promise not to interact outside their apartments,
        <p></p>Amane hadn't been able to help calling out to Mahiru when he'd seen her all alone in
        <p></p>the park again. Mahiru, for her part, probably did not much want to talk to him; her
        <p></p>expression was stiff and blank.
        <p></p>Amane thought it was fine if the girl wasn't feeling up to talking, when he noticed that
        <p></p>there were a number of white hairs stuck to her blazer. "You have some hair stuck to
        <p></p>your uniform; were you playing with a dog or a cat?" he asked.
        <p></p>"I wasn't playing. I just helped a cat that was stranded up a tree get back down," Mahiru
        <p></p>explained.
        <p></p>"What a total cliche … Ah, I get it now."
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"Wait right there. Don't you dare move."
        <p></p>Amane had finally realized just why Mahiru was sitting there alone on the bench. He
        <p></p>sighed and dashed off. He was certain that Mahiru would do as he had asked and
        <p></p>would not go anywhere. Actually, it would have been more appropriate to say that she
        <p></p>couldn't go anywhere.
        <p></p>Muttering to himself about how Mahiru chose the strangest times to act tough, Amane
        <p></p>bought a compress and medical tape from the neighborhood drugstore, along with a
        <p></p>cup of ice normally used for iced coffee from a convenience store. When Amane at last
        <p></p>returned to the park, he found Mahiru sitting on the bench, just as he'd expected. She
        <p></p>hadn't so much as shifted.
        <p></p>"Shiina, take off your tights."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>He gave a direct order, and she answered in an extremely cold voice.
        <p></p>"Yeah, I know it's kind of sudden… Look, I'll put my blazer over you and turn around,
        <p></p>so take the tights off. We need to ice the injury and put a compress on it."
        <p></p>As expected, Mahiru was none too happy at being ordered to take off her tights, so by
        <p></p>way of explanation, Amane waved the bag full of medical supplies.
        <p></p>Mahiru's face understandably tightened. "…How did you know?"
        <p></p>"You had one of your loafers off, and that ankle seemed slightly swollen. Plus, you didn't
        <p></p>try to stand up. It really is a total cliche to sprain your ankle while rescuing a cat."
        <p></p>"Oh, be quiet."
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah. Now, take off your tights and give me your foot."
        <p></p>It was something anyone would have known just from looking, but Mahiru was making
        <p></p>a sour face, perhaps because she hadn't expected him to notice that she was hurt.
        <p></p>Obediently, Mahiru accepted Amane's blazer and put it over her knees, so it seemed
        <p></p>like she was going to listen to what he was saying.
        <p></p>Amane turned his back to Mahiru, put the ice from the cup he had bought at the
        <p></p>convenience store into a plastic bag, and poured water over it.
        <p></p>After he tied the top shut so it wouldn't spill out, he wrapped it loosely in a hand towel
        <p></p>that he kept in his backpack, making an impromptu ice pack. Then he turned around
        <p></p>slowly.
        <p></p>Mahiru had done as he had asked and removed her tights, exposing her bare legs. They
        <p></p>were slender and smooth—and looked soft even as she tensed up. The unnatural
        <p></p>swelling around her ankle was evident.
        <p></p>"Well, it's not that badly swollen, but it could get worse if you move it too much. First
        <p></p>of all, this is going to be cold, but let's ice it for a bit. Once the pain goes away a little,
        <p></p>I'll put a compress on, so take it easy," Amane explained.
        <p></p>"…Thank you."
        <p></p>"From now on, just ask for my help. It's not like you'll owe me or anything."
        <p></p>If anything, it's the opposite—I want to pay you back in some small way for everything
        <p></p>you've done for me, so I'd appreciate if you would let me solve one or two problems for you.
        <p></p>Mahiru sported her usual expression. Still, she didn't argue with Amane and quietly
        <p></p>let him ice her ankle while her leg was propped up on the bench.
        <p></p>"Has the pain gotten any better?" Amane asked after a moment.
        <p></p>"…Yeah, a bit," Mahiru replied.
        <p></p>"All right, I'm putting the compress on, so… don't get mad at me for being a perv or a
        <p></p>groper or something, okay?"
        <p></p>"I wouldn't say something so rude to the person helping me."
        <p></p>"Good to hear."
        <p></p>Stressing that he had absolutely no untoward thoughts, Amane squatted down next to
        <p></p>Mahiru's leg and stuck a compress on her swollen, red ankle.
        <p></p>When Amane initially asked about the level of pain, it sounded like the sort of thing
        <p></p>where Mahiru could still stand and walk, but moving risked agitating the sprain
        <p></p>further, so she was better off sitting here quietly. As long as she stayed off it, it would
        <p></p>probably remain a minor injury.
        <p></p>Amane had just finished sticking on the compress and was securing it with medical
        <p></p>tape when he noticed Mahiru staring intently down at him.
        <p></p>"You're surprisingly skillful with that," she commented.
        <p></p>"Well, I can do first aid. Still can't cook, though." Amane shrugged, acting a little silly,
        <p></p>and Mahiru let out a small laugh. He was glad to see her taut expression relax some,
        <p></p>even if it was only a tiny bit. Reassured by Mahiru's slightly softened attitude, Amane
        <p></p>pulled the pants of his gym uniform from his backpack.
        <p></p>"Here," he said, handing them to Mahiru.
        <p></p>"What?" she asked.
        <p></p>"Don't make that face at me; I don't like it. Anyway, your legs are exposed, right? And
        <p></p>it's not like you can put your tights back on with the compress stuck to you. Relax, I
        <p></p>haven't worn them."
        <p></p>It would be bad to let her put her tights back on over her swollen ankle, especially now
        <p></p>that it had medical tape wrapped around it. Since it looked so painful, Amane figured
        <p></p>Mahiru could wear his gym pants, both as protection from the cold and to stop anyone
        <p></p>from seeing her underwear.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to understand that he was just trying to be considerate, and so she
        <p></p>slipped the pants on.
        <p></p>Amane snatched up his blazer and handed Mahiru the parka he'd been wearing.
        <p></p>"Here, wear this," he told her.
        <p></p>"Wait, but why?"
        <p></p>"Do you want to be seen being carried?"
        <p></p>Letting Mahiru walk on her ankle was a bad idea. Amane had been planning to bring
        <p></p>her home from the start. They were both headed to the same place, after all.
        <p></p>"Oh, sorry, but could you put my backpack on?" Amane asked. "I can't carry you on my
        <p></p>back if I'm wearing it, obviously."
        <p></p>"Is there an option where you don't carry me?"
        <p></p>"Look here, your ankle is twisted, so you need to rest it. No one's around, and I've got
        <p></p>perfectly good legs, so please put them to use."
        <p></p>"Your legs?"
        <p></p>"What, you'd prefer my arms? Would you rather I support you from the side?"
        <p></p>"Are you even strong enough to carry me all that way?"
        <p></p>"Are you making fun of me?… Well, I'm actually not that confident."
        <p></p>Amane knew he could support Mahiru if she leaned on him, but honestly, it would be
        <p></p>quite difficult to fully carry her all the way back to the apartment complex. What's
        <p></p>more, it would be sure to attract a lot of attention, which Amane preferred to avoid.
        <p></p>He knew that Mahiru had been poking fun when she'd brought up his strength, so he
        <p></p>smiled, glad she was feeling well enough to crack jokes like that.
        <p></p>"Look, if you're game, put the hood up and wear my backpack. After you get on my back,
        <p></p>take your own bag, too, while you're at it. I won't be able to hold it if I'm supporting
        <p></p>you," Amane instructed.
        <p></p>"…Sorry," Mahiru muttered.
        <p></p>"I'm telling you: It's fine. It wouldn't be very manly of me to leave an injured person
        <p></p>behind and go home—or to make you walk."
        <p></p>Amane crouched down and turned away from her, and Mahiru timidly leaned onto
        <p></p>Amane's back.
        <p></p>Mahiru was wearing Amane's parka, so she had on even more clothes than normal,
        <p></p>but even so, he could feel her body pressed against him, slim and willowy.
        <p></p>After confirming that Mahiru's arms were secured around his neck without choking
        <p></p>him, Amane stood up slowly, carrying the injured girl on his back.
        <p></p>I knew it; she's so light, Amane thought. He wondered if he should be the one worrying
        <p></p>about her diet instead of the other way around. It was more likely that she was just
        <p></p>naturally petite, though; that was probably all it was.
        <p></p>Mahiru smelled slightly sweet, and though Amane could tell all sorts of things about
        <p></p>how anxious she was feeling based on how tightly she clung to him, he headed for
        <p></p>home without showing it.
        <p></p>A few people did stare at the sight of a guy carrying someone on his back, but Mahiru
        <p></p>had completely covered her face with the hood of his parka, so Amane wasn't too
        <p></p>worried about what little attention was being paid to them.
        <p></p>"All right, here we are." Amane carried Mahiru as far as her front door, then let her
        <p></p>down and quickly turned to leave without interfering any further.
        <p></p>Since Mahiru could get around on her own while leaning on a wall, Amane guessed
        <p></p>that her injury was probably not all that serious. Thankfully, it was Friday, so Mahiru
        <p></p>had plenty of time to rest her ankle and get back on her feet with no problems.
        <p></p>"I don't need dinner tonight, so you should rest. If you like, I could bring you some
        <p></p>nutritional supplements," Amane offered.
        <p></p>"I'm fine. I have some stuff prepared," Mahiru answered.
        <p></p>"That's good. See ya."
        <p></p>That was the most important thing: that food wouldn't be a problem. It was essential
        <p></p>that Mahiru be able to keep still and rest. Amane watched her open the lock on her
        <p></p>front door, and he, too, took out his apartment key.
        <p></p>"…Um," started Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>When Amane heard the girl's voice and turned around, he saw that she was looking
        <p></p>up at him timidly, clutching her bag to her chest. She looked somewhat troubled, but
        <p></p>as he tilted his head in confusion, she seemed to regain her resolve and looked straight
        <p></p>into his eyes.
        <p></p>"…Thank you for what you did today. You really saved me," Mahiru admitted.
        <p></p>"It's fine, really. I just did it because I wanted to. Take care." Embarrassed by the notion
        <p></p>of Mahiru fretting over his help, Amane quickly dismissed the thought from his mind.
        <p></p>After Mahiru gave him a quick nod, Amane turned to unlock his own door. It was only
        <p></p>then that Amane realized that Mahiru was still wearing his parka and athletic pants,
        <p></p>but he was sure she would return them another day, so he slipped into his apartment
        <p></p>without saying anything.
        <p></p>"Damn, dude, you so healthy that you wear shorts year-round now?"
        <p></p>Amane's melancholy in Monday's gym class had less to do with his lack of athletic
        <p></p>talent and more to do with the fact that he was wearing knee-length jersey shorts
        <p></p>during an unpleasantly cold season. Everyone else had already switched to their
        <p></p>winter gym uniforms, but Amane stood out from all the rest, his legs bare below the
        <p></p>knee.
        <p></p>"As if. I just forgot my pants."
        <p></p>"Idiot."
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>Amane hadn't seen Mahiru over the weekend, and she still had his gym pants, but he
        <p></p>couldn't tell Itsuki that, so there was nothing to do but say that he forgot. He had
        <p></p>resigned himself to the inevitable mockery, though when Itsuki slapped his back,
        <p></p>cackling with laughter, Amane still found it in himself to slap him back.
        <p></p>Amane let out a soft sigh as he watched Itsuki groan quietly. Then his gaze shifted. At
        <p></p>the moment, the boys were practicing their high jumps, and the girls were using the
        <p></p>other side of the field. What's more, since two classes of students were using the field
        <p></p>at once, it was fairly crowded.
        <p></p>The girls were practicing different track-and-field events, so between taking turns, the
        <p></p>girls had plenty of time to watch Amane's class.
        <p></p>"Do your best, Kadowaki!"
        <p></p>Usually, the boys and girls took gym class in different places on campus; with the girls
        <p></p>present, the boys were getting all worked up. The girls, on the other hand, all spent
        <p></p>their time watching Amane's most popular classmate, the handsome Yuuta Kadowaki.
        <p></p>Amane had never really talked to him before, but he was nice to everyone and was a
        <p></p>great student, and on top of that, he was the ace of the track club despite being only a
        <p></p>first-year. Everyone knew he was popular with the girls. Amane figured Yuuta must
        <p></p>have won some kind of karmic lottery. A lot of the other boys didn't care for him as
        <p></p>much, and there were always a lot of sulky looks when he was around.
        <p></p>"Oh wow, looks like Yuuta's as popular as always," Itsuki observed.
        <p></p>"Looks that way," Amane answered dully.
        <p></p>"You don't seem too interested," Itsuki prodded.
        <p></p>"Well, it's not like we're friends or anything; we've barely ever spoken. So why should
        <p></p>I care?"
        <p></p>It wasn't as though Yuuta was mean or ever messed with Amane. They had nothing to
        <p></p>do with each other, so Amane honestly did not care. He knew that he was in the
        <p></p>minority there, but he couldn't bring himself to envy Yuuta the same way all the other
        <p></p>boys did. More specifically, Amane knew that Yuuta was so far out of his league that
        <p></p>envying him was pointless.
        <p></p>"Typical Amane. What, you don't get jealous now?" Itsuki asked.
        <p></p>"Oh, should I be like 'Wow, I'm sooo jealous of his populaaarity,' huh?" Amane mocked.
        <p></p>"That was pretty good." Itsuki guffawed.
        <p></p>Amane looked over at Yuuta, who was wearing a brilliant smile and basking in
        <p></p>feminine adoration. Even Amane had to admit that Yuuta's athletic body and
        <p></p>handsome face made him look just like a prince. In fact, some girls had taken to calling
        <p></p>him that.
        <p></p>Yuuta rewarded the girls' passionate gazes and shrill voices with another radiant
        <p></p>smile and waved back at them. He really knew how to cultivate a following.
        <p></p>"Well, he sure is popular, no arguing with that," admitted Itsuki.
        <p></p>"I know. The other guys can't contain their jealousy," Amane said.
        <p></p>"Ha-ha. But the girls are real energetic, too." Itsuki only had eyes for his girlfriend,
        <p></p>Chitose. He had no interest in other girls, so he saw the Yuuta issue as everyone else's
        <p></p>problem. Chitose wasn't the least bit interested in Yuuta, so Itsuki probably didn't
        <p></p>spend much energy thinking about him.
        <p></p>We've got a prince and an angel… This school has a lot of people with cringey nicknames.
        <p></p>Come to think of it, I wonder if Mahiru the angel ended up getting enough rest. Amane
        <p></p>hadn't seen her leave her apartment over the weekend. It was good she was resting
        <p></p>comfortably, but he still wondered about the state of her injury.
        <p></p>Amane stealthily scanned the field with his eyes. His class was sharing the field with
        <p></p>Mahiru's, so she should've been there. Without too much effort, Amane spotted her.
        <p></p>Even in a crowd, the angel was easy to pick out. She hadn't changed into gym clothes
        <p></p>and wasn't practicing with the rest of her class. Evidently, she was sitting out today.
        <p></p>Amane was sure that he was not the only boy staring at Mahiru, who sat there looking
        <p></p>small and quiet. Though they were far away from each other, their eyes met suddenly,
        <p></p>and when Amane shifted his gaze around awkwardly, he saw a small smile pass over
        <p></p>Mahiru's lips. Since she was looking toward Amane, that meant she was also looking
        <p></p>toward the rest of the boys. Each of Amane's classmates took the smile for their own,
        <p></p>nearly inciting a riot.
        <p></p>"Did she just smile at me?!"
        <p></p>"No way; must be me!"
        <p></p>"This is our chance! We've gotta impress her!"
        <p></p>"The prince is hogging the spotlight."
        <p></p>To think that Mahiru could cause such excitement with just one meager smile… Amane
        <p></p>didn't know whether it was because she was that amazing or because the boys were
        <p></p>all that simple.
        <p></p>"…Buncha morons," Itsuki muttered. He'd apparently been thinking the same thing.
        <p></p>Amane chuckled. "Well, if we don't wanna fail gym class, we'd better get moving, too."
        <p></p>"What's that, Amane? The angel's heavenly gaze got you all riled up, too?"
        <p></p>"No, nothing like that. I told you, I'm not interested."
        <p></p>"Well, guess I'll drop it, then. Since you don't care and all."
        <p></p>Itsuki seemed like he was about to start boasting about how great girlfriends are,
        <p></p>likely citing his own personal experience, but Amane was quick to brush him off.
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah," he said. He spared one more glance in Mahiru's direction and smiled
        <p></p>wryly.
        <p></p>"Thank you for what you did the other day. Here's your parka and sweatpants back."
        <p></p>That evening, when Mahiru brought him his portion of dinner, she was carrying a
        <p></p>paper bag in addition to the plastic container. Amane could see at a glance that the
        <p></p>parka and pants he had loaned her a few days ago were folded neatly in the bag.
        <p></p>"Mm. How's the ankle?" he asked.
        <p></p>"The pain is already mostly gone. I've decided not to do any exercise until it's completely
        <p></p>healed," Mahiru replied.
        <p></p>"That's for the best. Looks like you're sitting out gym class, too."
        <p></p>"Yeah."
        <p></p>Mahiru had decided to play it safe and not participate in gym, and Amane figured it
        <p></p>was probably the right thing to do. Her ankle didn't look like it was hurting her
        <p></p>anymore, but she still slightly favored that leg when she walked, indicating that it was
        <p></p>not yet entirely healed.
        <p></p>As Amane was nodding at the girl's sensible decision, he thought back on the day's
        <p></p>gym class and smiled suddenly. "You know, you're really amazing, Miss Angel. With a
        <p></p>single smile, all the boys were practically bursting with excitement."
        <p></p>"I told you to stop calling me that… And it's not as if I like that kind of attention. It
        <p></p>really bothers me, you know," Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"Well, who wouldn't get fired up when a beautiful person looks at them? You know,
        <p></p>the girls started shrieking today, too, when Kadowaki waved at them."
        <p></p>"…Kadowaki… oh, that super-popular guy?" Mahiru didn't seem to be too interested in
        <p></p>the prince. Actually, it seemed like she didn't even recognize his name. Amane had to
        <p></p>describe him a bit before Mahiru realized who he was talking about.
        <p></p>Yuuta wasn't as popular as the angel, but he was a fairly well-known boy in their grade,
        <p></p>so Amane was surprised that she didn't know who he was.
        <p></p>"You're not interested in him?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Not particularly. We're in different classes, and we've never really spoken," Mahiru
        <p></p>replied.
        <p></p>"Hmm. The other girls go bananas for him, though. They can't get enough of the cool
        <p></p>dude."
        <p></p>"Well, he does have a handsome face. But we don't talk; we don't have any connection.
        <p></p>So I don't really care."
        <p></p>"You're so candid about things like that," Amane observed.
        <p></p>"Well, if looks are so important, don't you think it's strange that you don't like me?"
        <p></p>asked Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Oh, so you do realize how beautiful you are?"
        <p></p>Mahiru was quite right in what she said. Beauty could be the spark that ignited greater
        <p></p>affections, but it was rarely the sole source of love. Amane agreed with that, just as he
        <p></p>agreed that Mahiru was very pretty. It was certainly a surprise to hear her say that
        <p></p>herself, though.
        <p></p>"I know that, objectively speaking, I'm considered very attractive, and I do work hard
        <p></p>to maintain my appearance. It's only natural. Given how often people make a big deal
        <p></p>about my looks, I can tell what they think of me even if I don't want to know." Mahiru
        <p></p>didn't seem to be boasting in the least.
        <p></p>She was certainly being honest about how much effort she spent on her appearance.
        <p></p>Mahiru had always had a good-looking face, but clearly she was not content to coast
        <p></p>by on natural good looks. Her hair was like a radiant halo, befitting her angelic
        <p></p>nickname, and the luster of her skin was also always perfect, without a single blemish.
        <p></p>Her hands didn't get chapped, even when she was doing housework, and even her
        <p></p>fingernails were beautifully polished. The gentle curves of her body spoke to a wellbalanced figure that had likely taken some effort to cultivate.
        <p></p>"I'm going to say something straight up, so don't get mad at me…," Amane began, "but…
        <p></p>you don't seem to be embarrassed by all this praise."
        <p></p>"I'd get annoyed before I'd get embarrassed if someone wouldn't stop flattering me,"
        <p></p>Mahiru answered curtly.
        <p></p>"Guess being beautiful has its own struggles."
        <p></p>"Still, beauty does have its advantages, so I suppose I shouldn't complain."
        <p></p>"You say that like you wouldn't know…"
        <p></p>"What? Would you rather I bashfully say 'Oh, no, that's not true!'?"
        <p></p>"No, as someone who knows what you're really like, that would be weird."
        <p></p>"Exactly. Honestly, I don't see the point in putting on an act like that in front of you."
        <p></p>"Glad to hear it."
        <p></p>Mahiru had only recently dropped her public persona around Amane, so if she
        <p></p>changed back now… Amane could feel goosebumps prickling at the thought of facing
        <p></p>the distant angel he saw at school rather than the girl he was gradually getting to
        <p></p>know.
        <p></p>In the end, things between the two of them remained as they were.
        <p></p>Amane looked at the food container he'd been handed. There was actually more food
        <p></p>than usual. The container was packed with several side dishes, each one a large
        <p></p>portion. Rather than leftovers, it was more like Amane had been handed a fancy boxed
        <p></p>lunch.
        <p></p>"Today's quite the smorgasbord," he said.
        <p></p>"Because you took such good care of me," Mahiru replied.
        <p></p>"I told you not to worry about that… Oh, there are croquettes in here!" Amane could
        <p></p>never say no to croquettes.
        <p></p>Croquettes were frequently sold a la carte but could be a big pain to make yourself. As
        <p></p>such, you could consider them the pinnacle of home cooking. After steaming potatoes,
        <p></p>mashing them, stirring in saute ed beef, onions, and more, and then forming the
        <p></p>patties, you had to completely chill them, then add batter and fry them. It was a very
        <p></p>involved process. Even Amane, who rarely cooked anything, had watched his mother
        <p></p>make croquettes and had decided never to make them himself because they were such
        <p></p>a pain.
        <p></p>"Well, I had them already made and chilling, so I only had to fry them," Mahiru
        <p></p>explained.
        <p></p>"Is that why there's fried chicken, too?" asked Amane.
        <p></p>"That's right."
        <p></p>Living alone, Amane didn't get to eat a lot of fried dishes, so he was grateful for the
        <p></p>handmade food. Of course, they were best when they were freshly made, while the
        <p></p>coating was still nice and crispy, served with hot rice.
        <p></p>"…Sometime, I'd like to try them straight out of the oil," Amane muttered.
        <p></p>Mahiru had packed the fried chicken into the container after letting it cool, perhaps
        <p></p>for hygienic reasons. So no matter what, Amane would need to warm the food back
        <p></p>up. Though fried foods could be restored to a crispy texture via a toaster oven, it still
        <p></p>wasn't the same as eating the stuff fresh. Amane had no doubts that Mahiru's cooking
        <p></p>would still be delicious, of course, but it would probably be even better right from the
        <p></p>pan.
        <p></p>Amane hadn't meant to whisper what he had been thinking; his desire had simply
        <p></p>leaked from his lips. Unfortunately, he'd said it loud enough that Mahiru raised her
        <p></p>eyebrows a little.
        <p></p>"Are you inviting me over?" she asked.
        <p></p>"That's not what I'm saying at all! It's already too presumptuous of me to share your
        <p></p>meals." Amane hadn't meant it that way at all, and he shrugged and vehemently denied
        <p></p>it.
        <p></p>Mahiru brought a hand to her mouth and directed her gaze downward. She seemed to
        <p></p>be mulling something over and did not make eye contact with Amane.
        <p></p>"…Your share," she finally said.
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"Let me cook at your place, and we can consider that as part of paying for your share
        <p></p>of the food expenses."
        <p></p>Mahiru's sudden proposition left Amane's mouth hanging open in shock.
        <p></p>The accidental mention about eating the fried foods fresh had been more of a sardonic
        <p></p>wish than anything else. That Mahiru had actually considered and agreed to it left
        <p></p>Amane completely bewildered.
        <p></p>Normally, who would think of going into the home of some boy they didn't know all
        <p></p>that well to cook dinner? Maybe it would be more efficient to cook at his place rather
        <p></p>than bring the food over after, but he was a member of the opposite sex, and it wasn't
        <p></p>like they were close friends. Wouldn't doing that make Mahiru uneasy?
        <p></p>"You definitely don't need to do that; I've already received way more than I could ask
        <p></p>for, way more than I deserve… Aren't you worried about your safety?"
        <p></p>"If you try anything, I'll crush you. Hard. No mercy."
        <p></p>"Ack, you're scary! I felt a chill."
        <p></p>"Well, I don't suppose it will come to that. You already know what the risks are, and
        <p></p>I've decided you won't do anything. You know how popular I am at school, right?"
        <p></p>"Even supposing I did try something, it'd be the end of me."
        <p></p>Mahiru was vastly more popular than Amane, and on top of that, everyone saw her as
        <p></p>this delicate girl, so if word got around that Amane had so much as thought about
        <p></p>doing anything inappropriate to her, he was sure he'd never be able to set foot on
        <p></p>school grounds again. Amane was not so foolish or so unprincipled as to try something
        <p></p>knowing that it would mean, at best, social ruin. He wasn't interested anyway.
        <p></p>"Besides…," Mahiru added.
        <p></p>"Besides?" Amane asked, urging her to continue.
        <p></p>"You're not even the right type for someone like me," Mahiru asserted with a straight
        <p></p>face, then suddenly smiled.
        <p></p>"And what if I was your type?" Amane pressed.
        <p></p>"First of all, I believe you were the one who insisted on talking to me. And then wanted
        <p></p>nothing to do with me."
        <p></p>"And that won you over?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"I mean, it told me that you're harmless enough," Mahiru explained.
        <p></p>"Uh, thanks, I guess."
        <p></p>Whether that was a good thing or not, Amane couldn't deny it was true. After all, he
        <p></p>had never had any intention of doing anything with Mahiru in the first place. One thing
        <p></p>was certain, however: Amane was not going to pass up the chance to enjoy a freshly
        <p></p>made meal. He accepted the title of harmless guy and gained the privilege of sharing
        <p></p>dinner.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 8: The First Meal Together 
        <p></p>Mahiru was going to start cooking dinner at Amane's apartment, and she presented
        <p></p>him with a list of conditions:
        <p></p>• Amane would pay for half the cost of ingredients, plus an additional labor cost, plus
        <p></p>the cost of any incidental expenses.
        <p></p>• The two of them would each contact the other no later than the day before if they
        <p></p>had something to do and couldn't eat together.
        <p></p>• They would divide the work of shopping and cleaning up afterward.
        <p></p>Regarding the extra labor cost, it had taken some work to get Mahiru to agree to it.
        <p></p>Amane had insisted that he felt bad about all the time she was spending on him. It was
        <p></p>to be expected, since she did all the work making the food. Aside from that, though,
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru had come to an agreement rather quickly.
        <p></p>And so, the day after their agreement had been ratified, Mahiru came over early holding
        <p></p>supermarket bags in both hands and made preparations to start cooking.
        <p></p>"…It's really all brand-new, like it's hardly been used…," Mahiru commented.
        <p></p>"Shut up," Amane shot back.
        <p></p>A beautiful girl stood in his kitchen, and she was wearing an apron. This was like a
        <p></p>fantasy come to life. Amane was sure he was going to lose it any second now. When
        <p></p>Mahiru pointed out, yet again, that he had really never used his kitchen, he felt a deep
        <p></p>shame.
        <p></p>"You've got an impressive collection of gadgets here, but they're like pearls tossed
        <p></p>before swine," Mahiru observed.
        <p></p>"Well, if you use them, they won't go to waste," Amane reasoned.
        <p></p>"That's a poor excuse, after the fact. Your precious cookware is practically dying from
        <p></p>neglect."
        <p></p>"All right then, bring it back to life with your amazing culinary talents. I sure as hell
        <p></p>can't."
        <p></p>With gracious concession, Amane motioned for Mahiru to take over. She returned the
        <p></p>gesture with an exasperated expression, but perhaps because she'd expected as much,
        <p></p>she just sighed and didn't complain further.
        <p></p>"All right, let's get started. Do you have any spices?"
        <p></p>"Of course I do; are you making fun of me? They're all properly stored—and none are
        <p></p>expired, either."
        <p></p>"Wow, I'm surprised."
        <p></p>"It's because they've never been opened."
        <p></p>"That's nothing to brag about. All right, if you don't have what we need, I can bring
        <p></p>things over from my place to use this once."
        <p></p>"That would be helpful."
        <p></p>"For now, if you have the basics, I think we can make do. Also, I decided on today's
        <p></p>dishes already; is that all right?"
        <p></p>"I don't know much about cooking, so I'm happy with anything as long as I get to eat.
        <p></p>I don't have strong preferences."
        <p></p>"Really? Then let's hurry up and get started… Please show me where you keep
        <p></p>everything."
        <p></p>"In this basket."
        <p></p>"They're really unopened, huh…"
        <p></p>Mahiru raised her eyebrows in shock as she stared at the basket filled with untouched
        <p></p>seasonings. Perhaps because she'd been warned before she'd seen the unused spices,
        <p></p>she quickly reassumed her usual demeanor and began washing her hands at the sink.
        <p></p>"All right, I'm going to start making stuff, so you can go wait in the living room or in
        <p></p>your bedroom," Mahiru declared.
        <p></p>"Okay. I can't help you with anything anyway," Amane accepted.
        <p></p>"What a gentleman. I suppose you'd just get in the way if you hung around."
        <p></p>"You're awfully honest."
        <p></p>"It's just the truth. There's no need to sugarcoat it."
        <p></p>As Mahiru said, he would clearly just be in the way, so Amane obediently returned to
        <p></p>the living room and watched her back as she worked.
        <p></p>When she had finished washing her hands, Mahiru quickly set to work. Amane didn't
        <p></p>know what she was making, but based on the ingredients she had readied, it was
        <p></p>probably Japanese food.
        <p></p>Everything about this felt strange to Amane, like he was in a dream, but it was real.
        <p></p>Mahiru was actually preparing the ingredients right there, her hair tied up in a gently
        <p></p>swaying ponytail.
        <p></p>What's with this situation? It's like I've got a wife or something, Amane thought.
        <p></p>Mahiru probably didn't feel the same way, but their setup looked a little too much like
        <p></p>they were a happy family, and Amane couldn't help but imagine it. He didn't have even
        <p></p>the smallest desire to live with Mahiru, but the sight of a beautiful girl standing in his
        <p></p>kitchen was in itself enough to send his mind to all sorts of places. Whether or not
        <p></p>there was any affection between Amane and Mahiru, just having a lovely girl treat him
        <p></p>to a home-cooked meal was enough to touch Amane's heart.
        <p></p>"…Are you thinking weird things over there?"
        <p></p>"You can stop with the strange speculations."
        <p></p>Amane had frozen when Mahiru called him out. She'd guessed what he was thinking
        <p></p>without even turning around.
        <p></p>She sure is sharp…
        <p></p>Feeling amazed and anxious all at once, Amane stamped down on the not-quite-evil
        <p></p>base instincts that had begun welling up inside him and returned to staring at
        <p></p>Mahiru's back.
        <p></p>About an hour later, Mahiru began setting out completed dishes on the table.
        <p></p>She'd chosen to make Japanese food today, which was typical when one considered
        <p></p>her penchant for healthy cooking.
        <p></p>"It turns out you have quite a few utensils and seasonings, so it looks like I won't have
        <p></p>to bring anything from my place. Starting tomorrow, I can try more elaborate dishes,
        <p></p>too."
        <p></p>"I mean, I'm just grateful you're making anything for me," Amane admitted.
        <p></p>Perhaps because Mahiru hadn't known how many pieces of cookware and seasonings
        <p></p>Amane had in his collection, she had made many simple dishes rather than anything
        <p></p>more intricate, but the presentation was flawless nonetheless.
        <p></p>Lined up along the table was an array of Japanese-style dishes. From fish simmered in
        <p></p>soy sauce to dressed greens. From rolled omelets to miso soup. Every last item was
        <p></p>something Amane could never dream of making himself.
        <p></p>Previously, Amane had said he didn't have any particular likes or dislikes, but he did
        <p></p>in fact love Japanese food. He wanted to reassure Mahiru, who looked apologetic for
        <p></p>having only prepared easy recipes, that this was exactly what he had wanted.
        <p></p>"…It looks amazing," Amane said.
        <p></p>"I'm happy to hear you say that. Eat up while it's still hot."
        <p></p>Mahiru sat down in a chair next to her, so Amane took a seat across the table.
        <p></p>His dining table was small, since he lived alone, so no matter how they sat, they were
        <p></p>still close together. It was lucky that Amane happened to have two chairs just in case
        <p></p>a guest stopped by, but seeing a beautiful girl sitting right before his eyes evoked some
        <p></p>indescribable feeling from within him.
        <p></p>Once Amane set upon the food, however, even Mahiru's beauty ceased to matter.
        <p></p>Hurriedly, he said "Let's eat" and started with the miso soup.
        <p></p>The moment he brought the bowl to his lips and took a sip, the fragrant miso and the
        <p></p>flavor of the dashi spread through his mouth. The gentle taste was so completely
        <p></p>different from instant miso soup. Amane could tell that it must have been prepared
        <p></p>with great care. The miso flavor wasn't overpowering, and it was thoughtfully
        <p></p>seasoned to allow the taste of the dashi broth to come through.
        <p></p>At first, Amane felt that the soup's taste was just a little bit strong, but after he
        <p></p>considered drinking it while eating the other dishes, he realized that it struck the
        <p></p>perfect balance and knew he would empty his bowl. Rather than being overwhelming,
        <p></p>the miso soup was a comforting flavor. It was a taste that made you want to eat more.
        <p></p>"Delicious," Amane said with sincerity.
        <p></p>"Thank you for saying so." Mahiru's eyes crinkled in a relieved smile.
        <p></p>Amane had been complimenting Mahiru's cooking for a while, but she'd probably been
        <p></p>feeling nervous with this being the first time she'd cooked right in front of him.
        <p></p>Mahiru watched Amane for a few moments before eating anything herself. Once she
        <p></p>finally did start digging in, Amane extended his chopsticks toward the other dishes.
        <p></p>Sampling a bit of each dish, it came as no surprise to Amane that everything Mahiru
        <p></p>had prepared was fantastic.
        <p></p>The simmered fish was bursting with juicy flavor without sacrificing its tenderness.
        <p></p>Usually when fish was cooked for a long time to bring out the taste, it would naturally
        <p></p>lose some moisture and dry out, but this one was plump and had a nice texture.
        <p></p>As for the rolled omelets, they were tailored exactly to Amane's tastes. They were an
        <p></p>enticingly vivid yellow, and when Amane stuffed one in his mouth, he was unsurprised
        <p></p>by the gentle seasoning of dashi that greeted him.
        <p></p>When it came to Japanese-style omelets, Amane knew, some people added sugar when
        <p></p>making them, while others only used salt. These rolled ones had been flavored with
        <p></p>dashi, however. In addition to the rich taste of the dashi, Amane could also taste a faint
        <p></p>sweetness. He wondered if that light undertone came from honey. There probably
        <p></p>wasn't that much in the rolled omelets, but the satisfying hint of sweetness brought
        <p></p>out a real depth.
        <p></p>Amane had no real preference between sweet or salty when it came to egg dishes, but
        <p></p>the ones he liked best combined the complex flavor of dashi with what he suspected
        <p></p>was a bit of honey. Mahiru had accomplished that expertly, and Amane found himself
        <p></p>quite impressed.
        <p></p>Quietly muttering that the rolled omelets were delicious, Amane grabbed another one
        <p></p>with his chopsticks and quickly tossed it in his mouth.
        <p></p>Not only had they been perfectly flavored, they'd been skillfully cooked as well. The
        <p></p>stock added to the eggs made them extra juicy.
        <p></p>These are definitely better than Mom's rolled omelets. He kept rude thoughts about his
        <p></p>nonpresent mother to himself as he smacked his lips happily. Then he realized that
        <p></p>Mahiru was staring at him.
        <p></p>"…You really seem to be enjoying it."
        <p></p>"Because it's all so good. I'm paying my respects to the delicious food."
        <p></p>"Sure, all right."
        <p></p>"Besides, doesn't it feel better when I'm honest about how much I enjoy it rather than
        <p></p>sitting here eating with a blank expression?"
        <p></p>If you think something's delicious, you've got to really act like it, otherwise, the person
        <p></p>who made it will be left wondering. Even if you say you enjoy it, who would believe you
        <p></p>if you didn't look the part? It's better to be honest and just let how you feel show directly
        <p></p>on your face. Whether you're the one giving thanks or being thanked, it's best to do what
        <p></p>feels good.
        <p></p>"…Yes, I suppose so…" Mahiru seemed to understand what Amane was saying, and she
        <p></p>smiled slightly. It was a gentle expression, and it betrayed just a hint of relief. It was
        <p></p>sweet enough that all of Amane's thoughts ground to a halt for a second.
        <p></p>"…Fujimiya?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"Ah… no, it's nothing," Amane replied. He'd been enchanted by the angel's smile, but
        <p></p>he couldn't possibly tell her that. To conceal his growing embarrassment, Amane took
        <p></p>another bite of food, ending any further discussion.
        <p></p>"…Thank you for dinner."
        <p></p>"I'm glad you liked it."
        <p></p>Amane had completely devoured every dish Mahiru had laid out. Mahiru's words had
        <p></p>been calm, but her expression was serene, and she seemed happy that Amane had
        <p></p>packed everything into his stomach. Not a single grain of rice had been left behind.
        <p></p>"It was delicious," Amane complimented.
        <p></p>"I could tell that much just by watching you," Mahiru quipped dryly.
        <p></p>"Better than my mom's cooking."
        <p></p>"I hear it's taboo to compare a girl's cooking to your mother's."
        <p></p>"Isn't that only true when you're criticizing someone? Anyway, does that bother you?"
        <p></p>"I don't mind, no."
        <p></p>"Well then, it's fine, right? It doesn't change the fact that it's delicious."
        <p></p>Mahiru was clearly no amateur cook. Amane's mother probably had more years of
        <p></p>experience under her belt, but she preferred different tastes, and many of her dishes
        <p></p>were fairly bland, so they were no match for Mahiru's carefully concocted foods.
        <p></p>"…Man, this is so awesome. To be able to eat like that every night!" exclaimed Amane.
        <p></p>"As long as I don't have anything else going on, that is," Mahiru added.
        <p></p>"…So I can really host you every night for dinner?"
        <p></p>"I wouldn't have suggested it if I was against the idea."
        <p></p>"Well, I guess that's true."
        <p></p>Mahiru was a straight shooter, so of course she would've never agreed to it if she didn't
        <p></p>want to in the first place. Amane still wasn't sure if it was okay to have her cooking for
        <p></p>him like this so often, however.
        <p></p>He was paying for half the ingredients, plus a bit extra to cover her labor, but even so,
        <p></p>he couldn't help feeling like the burden on Mahiru was too large.
        <p></p>"…Do you normally cook for boys you don't even like?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"I'm doing it because you were neglecting your health. Besides, I enjoy the act of
        <p></p>cooking itself, and I don't hate seeing you eat it with such gusto."
        <p></p>"But…," Amane started.
        <p></p>"If it bothers you that much, it would be no problem to stop."
        <p></p>"No, please, I'm begging you."
        <p></p>At the first sign of Mahiru possibly not cooking for him anymore, Amane instantly
        <p></p>retracted any and all complaints. That was just how much her food meant to him. To
        <p></p>have it snatched away now—it would practically be a matter of life and death.
        <p></p>Amane was entirely aware that Mahiru had gained full control of him by way of his
        <p></p>stomach, but Mahiru's cooking was just too delicious to refuse. Returning to
        <p></p>convenience-store meals now would be like robbing the world of color.
        <p></p>Shocked at Amane's immediate reply, Mahiru was stunned for a moment before
        <p></p>breaking into a smile.
        <p></p>"Well then, please continue to enjoy."
        <p></p>"…Okay."
        <p></p>It appeared that Amane's days of dining with the extremely charitable angel who made
        <p></p>all the food by hand would continue for a while yet. Amane couldn't help but sigh from
        <p></p>happiness, guilt, and anticipation.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 9: The Angel’s Birthday 
        <p></p>"Amaneee, how'd you do?"
        <p></p>Semester exams had finally ended. Having survived their collective hell, the students
        <p></p>gathered in their classroom, more exited and animated than usual.
        <p></p>Amane and Itsuki, both relieved that they had wrapped up all their tests, were
        <p></p>comparing their performances.
        <p></p>"Mm? Oh, pretty average," Amane answered. "Not that great, not that bad."
        <p></p>The exam had covered the expected material, so for anyone who studied daily, it wasn't
        <p></p>that difficult. Amane had done about as well this time as he had with other tests,
        <p></p>leaving little to say about his academics one way or the other.
        <p></p>Amane got bored easily, but he nevertheless always made sure to study. He was able
        <p></p>to retain most of the things taught in class, but it was far too difficult to get a perfect
        <p></p>score, so his scores usually floated between a solid eighty and ninety.
        <p></p>"I bet you'll make it into the top thirty, if you didn't outdo yourself… you egghead,"
        <p></p>Itsuki teased.
        <p></p>"It's because I study every day," Amane shot back.
        <p></p>"Well, how nice for you!"
        <p></p>"Don't start; you're the one forgetting to study 'cause you're too busy flirting."
        <p></p>The difference between Amane and Itsuki probably had less to do with their intellectual
        <p></p>capacities and more to do with which one of them spent all their free time with a
        <p></p>certain girlfriend named Chitose. Itsuki had the ability to make it into a pretty high
        <p></p>score bracket if he ever bothered to study seriously, but since Chitose was his real
        <p></p>priority, his actual rank was much lower than Amane's.
        <p></p>"…Girlfriends are great, you know?" Itsuki said wistfully.
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah."
        <p></p>"Hey, Amane, you should get a girlfriend, too!"
        <p></p>"If guys could just get girlfriends whenever they wanted, the men of the world
        <p></p>wouldn't shed so many bitter tears."
        <p></p>There were plenty of unsatisfied men who would have taken offense at Itsuki's
        <p></p>thoughtless remark. Amane, though, wasn't really inclined to get angry with him over
        <p></p>it. In fact, he'd never really felt that way about any girl, so he was content to let the
        <p></p>comment pass.
        <p></p>"Assuming I did get one, what then?" Amane inquired.
        <p></p>"A double date," Itsuki replied.
        <p></p>"That would end in a bad case of heartburn for my fictional girlfriend and me. We'd
        <p></p>have to break up."
        <p></p>"You could flirt in front of us, too, y'know!"
        <p></p>"Do you really think I can find a girlfriend, the way I live?"
        <p></p>"…I guess it's impossible."
        <p></p>"Right?"
        <p></p>Amane was honest to a fault, even with himself. He'd always found other people difficult
        <p></p>and exhausting, and he was aware that many people found him to be standoffish. That,
        <p></p>plus the blunt way he spoke, meant he was not all that popular. Amane's social status
        <p></p>would've made it hard to find a girlfriend, even if he was looking for one.
        <p></p>Against all odds, if Amane did somehow find a girlfriend, he was sure they wouldn't
        <p></p>be like Itsuki and Chitose. He couldn't picture himself flirting in public with a girl,
        <p></p>oblivious to anyone who might see.
        <p></p>"Come on, you should at least find someone you like, Amane. If you just cut your bangs
        <p></p>a little shorter, cleaned yourself up, and maybe found a style that worked for you, the
        <p></p>girls would definitely look at you differently, I'm tellin' ya."
        <p></p>Assuming Amane's self-evaluation was accurate, he didn't have the handsome looks
        <p></p>of a pretty boy like Yuuta or a Romeo like Itsuki, but he definitely didn't think he was
        <p></p>ugly, either. Amane figured that if he just spent more time on his grooming and paid
        <p></p>more attention to his clothes, he could rival most of the other boys his age. The
        <p></p>problem was that he didn't know enough about fashion to dress well, and he was
        <p></p>certainly not smooth enough with his words to win any girl over.
        <p></p>"I'm not interested in the kind of girl who picks a date based on appearance," Amane
        <p></p>asserted.
        <p></p>"You say that, but if you don't get them interested in the first place, you won't even get
        <p></p>to know them well enough to judge their personality, right?" Itsuki argued back.
        <p></p>"…Even if that's true, I'm not really looking for a girlfriend right now."
        <p></p>Were some hypothetical girl ever actually interested in Amane, it would be all over the
        <p></p>second she saw how he lived. Amane was a slob with no life skills, and on top of that,
        <p></p>he had a difficult time getting along with other people. If there was a girl who was
        <p></p>drawn to him, despite all that, he'd like to meet her. Such a hopeless thought was
        <p></p>enough to bring a bitter smile to Amane's face.
        <p></p>Besides, since Mahiru was cooking dinners for him now, a girlfriend could introduce
        <p></p>some unpleasant complications. Not that Amane intended to pursue a relationship in
        <p></p>the first place, but that was simply one more strike against the idea.
        <p></p>Amane felt that Mahiru's delicious cooking was worth more than the possibility of an
        <p></p>as-yet-unseen girlfriend, and that conviction was not likely to be easily overturned.
        <p></p>"Ugh, you're so boring… How about I get Chi to introduce you to one of her friends?"
        <p></p>offered Itsuki.
        <p></p>"You care way too much about this. Most of Chi's friends are too… excitable. It's hard
        <p></p>for me to hang out with them, even as friends." Amane quickly shot down the idea.
        <p></p>"Only because you're so gloomy."
        <p></p>"Oh, shut up."
        <p></p>"Well, if you say so, I won't say anything to her for now. But as a blossoming high school
        <p></p>boy, isn't it sad to live an empty life, all by yourself?"
        <p></p>"I don't need a girlfriend; they're too much trouble."
        <p></p>Just what do you think we're supposed to be doing at school anyway? Amane thought.
        <p></p>Even if he wasn't actually that serious about his studies, he still didn't see the point in
        <p></p>spending so much time worrying about romance. Above all, finding a real match was
        <p></p>no easy feat.
        <p></p>"…What a waste," Itsuki grumbled.
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah." Amane shrugged.
        <p></p>"But listen, you'll change your tune when you find a good one, Amane, ya hear?"
        <p></p>"What makes you so sure?"
        <p></p>"Because girls particularly like to fuss over guys like you."
        <p></p>"Whatever you say, man."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't imagine acting so sentimental; it didn't seem possible. He decided to
        <p></p>simply ignore his friend's words. Itsuki was looking at Amane with an exasperated
        <p></p>glare, when suddenly, his line of sight shifted, and his face relaxed.
        <p></p>"Itsukiii! Let's go home together!"
        <p></p>"Ah, Chi!"
        <p></p>Just then, Chitose appeared. Apparently, Itsuki had promised to walk her home, which
        <p></p>brought a swift end to their conversation.
        <p></p>When Amane turned to see where his friend's attention had shifted, he saw a girl with
        <p></p>medium-short light-brown hair tinged with red, looking their way with a radiant
        <p></p>smile. Well, to be more accurate, she was only looking and waving at Itsuki.
        <p></p>The girl's lively aura and bright, smiling face were enough to make Itsuki beam
        <p></p>whenever he saw her. That was the kind of effect Chitose had on people, and for better
        <p></p>or worse, she was always the center of attention.
        <p></p>Chitose was a different type of beauty than Mahiru. She had a great big smile as she
        <p></p>rushed over. With any luck, she wouldn't have much to say today, because usually
        <p></p>whenever Chitose talked, she made fun of Amane.
        <p></p>"You agree, right, Chi? Amane's the type of guy who needs a girlfriend to take care of
        <p></p>him, don't you think?" Itsuki asked.
        <p></p>"Don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong," chided Amane.
        <p></p>"Wait, what, do you have a girlfriend, Amane?!" Chitose exclaimed excitedly.
        <p></p>"No way."
        <p></p>"Aw, bummer," Chitose said, pouting. "If you did, I'd want to be friends with her."
        <p></p>"Knowing your idea of friendship, I would feel bad for my imaginary girlfriend,"
        <p></p>Amane said.
        <p></p>"Oh, so you have an imaginary girlfriend?" Chitose asked.
        <p></p>"Weren't we just talking about what if I had one?!"
        <p></p>"Kidding, kidding."
        <p></p>"I get tired just talking to you…"
        <p></p>"That's just because you don't have the stamina to handle me."
        <p></p>"Don't have the patience, more like…"
        <p></p>Even a short exchange with Chitose was mentally exhausting for Amane. Most of the
        <p></p>time, he tried to keep his head down and avoid other people, like at school. When he
        <p></p>found himself forced to carry on a conversation with someone as extroverted as
        <p></p>Chitose, it was really demanding.
        <p></p>Chitose didn't let Amane's sour attitude bother her at all and flashed the exhaustedlooking boy a truly joyful-looking smile. "You're such a mess."
        <p></p>Itsuki smiled in the same way and tossed out some perfunctory advice. "You'd better
        <p></p>get your act together, buddy."
        <p></p>Amane was already too worn-out, managing only to let out a deep sigh.
        <p></p>"…What are you doing?"
        <p></p>After returning home and gobbling up Mahiru's handmade food, Amane returned to
        <p></p>the living room once he was finished doing the dishes and saw Mahiru with a question
        <p></p>sheet spread out before her.
        <p></p>There'd been no agreement about cleaning the dishes, but Amane took the initiative
        <p></p>to shoulder the burden whenever possible. While he'd been tidying up, Mahiru had
        <p></p>gone to sit in the living room. It would have been inexcusable to make her do
        <p></p>everything and then hurry on home.
        <p></p>"I'm grading," Mahiru answered.
        <p></p>"I mean, I can see that."
        <p></p>She seemed to be reviewing her answers with her textbook out, checking that she
        <p></p>hadn't gotten anything wrong.
        <p></p>"So what's the result?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Well, if I didn't make any recording errors on my answer sheet, then it's… a perfect
        <p></p>score."
        <p></p>"I can't think of anything to say except 'It figures.'"
        <p></p>Just as Mahiru didn't show much of a reaction in regard to her errorless work, Amane
        <p></p>didn't have a very exaggerated response. He wasn't surprised, because her name was
        <p></p>practically always written in the top spot of the periodic exam results. He knew Mahiru
        <p></p>was more than capable of a perfect score, so he was not the least bit surprised by her
        <p></p>performance here.
        <p></p>"It's because studying doesn't bother me. I've actually already completed all of this
        <p></p>year's coursework, so now it's enough to simply review," Mahiru explained.
        <p></p>"Whoa, you really go all out…," Amane replied.
        <p></p>"You study a lot yourself, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>"You know what my grades are like?"
        <p></p>"I sort of remember your name in the ranking list."
        <p></p>Apparently, Mahiru had known a little bit about Amane before they ever spoke. She
        <p></p>must have noticed him among the top ranks, because she recounted his exact placement
        <p></p>on the most recent test without hesitation, almost like she was looking at the list right
        <p></p>now.
        <p></p>Amane did work pretty hard at his studies, but it wasn't because of some earnest drive
        <p></p>for success or anything. It was because of an agreement he'd come to with his parents.
        <p></p>In order to live alone, he had to maintain good grades.
        <p></p>"Well, it's a condition for my current lifestyle: I have to keep my grades up."
        <p></p>The only other facet to the agreement was that Amane had to visit home at least once
        <p></p>every six months, but he could take care of that over long school breaks. Basically, as
        <p></p>long as he was keeping his grades up, there were no problems.
        <p></p>"I study hard enough to keep my head above water, but nothing like you. You really put
        <p></p>a lot of effort in."
        <p></p>"…I have to try hard," Mahiru mumbled, casting her eyes downward. Her expression
        <p></p>was hidden by her bangs, and while Amane couldn't get a proper look at it, anyone
        <p></p>would have recognized it wasn't a happy one. Before he could get a read on her, though,
        <p></p>she quickly looked back up, once again wearing her usual expression.
        <p></p>Even if there had been time to point out the curious change, Amane probably wouldn't
        <p></p>have. He could tell that Mahiru was carrying some kind of painful burden by certain
        <p></p>things she did or faces she made.
        <p></p>While Amane made sure to never ask Mahiru what was bothering her or what was so
        <p></p>unpleasant, he still got the impression that she was struggling with something. Amane
        <p></p>imagined that, whatever it was, it had its origins in her home life. It was hardly the
        <p></p>kind of subject he could just casually broach with the girl. He understood that this was
        <p></p>not an area in which an outsider like himself could intrude, and so Amane never
        <p></p>touched the subject, and he persistently tried to maintain a sense of distance
        <p></p>appropriate for a neighbor.
        <p></p>Everyone had things they didn't want to talk about, even Amane. Treading thoughtlessly
        <p></p>on Mahiru would be rude, and he was sure that she appreciated the fact that he
        <p></p>pretended not to notice her distress.
        <p></p>Having disguised her abrupt change in mood, Mahiru declared in a clear voice that she
        <p></p>would be heading back to her own apartment. She put her textbook and her answer
        <p></p>sheet back into her bag.
        <p></p>Amane didn't have any intention of stopping her, so he replied simply "Mm-hmm,
        <p></p>sounds good" and watched Mahiru get ready to leave.
        <p></p>When the angel had finished putting everything away, she stood up from her seat, and
        <p></p>Amane noticed that she'd left something behind next to her empty cup. He picked it
        <p></p>up and discovered it was a case holding Mahiru's student ID, the kind any student
        <p></p>would have. She'd probably pulled it out along with her textbook and forgotten to put
        <p></p>it away.
        <p></p>Along with her name and picture, the little plastic card displayed common
        <p></p>information, like her student number, birthday, and blood type. After staring at it for
        <p></p>a second, Amane called out to Mahiru, who was in the entryway and putting her shoes
        <p></p>on.
        <p></p>"You forgot this," he said.
        <p></p>"Oh, sorry for the trouble. Well then, good night."
        <p></p>"Night."
        <p></p>Mahiru gave a quick, polite bow and turned her back on Amane's apartment. With a
        <p></p>small sigh, Amane watched her leave.
        <p></p>Thinking back to the birth date listed on Mahiru's school ID, Amane put a hand to his
        <p></p>forehead as he realized something.
        <p></p>"…That's in four days, isn't it?"
        <p></p>If he hadn't unintentionally seen the girl's ID, he likely never would've found out.
        <p></p>Amane wished that he'd known about Mahiru's birthday a little earlier and let out
        <p></p>another sigh, a deep one.
        <p></p>"Hey, I was wondering, is there anything you want?"
        <p></p>The following day, Amane tried to see if there was anything Mahiru might like as a gift.
        <p></p>There was no ulterior motive behind the gesture. In fact, Amane had been thinking for
        <p></p>a while that it might be nice to get something for the girl who had been taking care of
        <p></p>him every day. A birthday seemed like the perfect time.
        <p></p>There must have been something odd about the way Amane phrased the question,
        <p></p>however, because Mahiru gave him a puzzled look. One that made Amane begin to
        <p></p>regret asking such a direct question.
        <p></p>"Why are you asking all of the sudden?" Mahiru inquired.
        <p></p>"You don't seem very materialistic, so I was just curious."
        <p></p>"Out of nowhere again…"
        <p></p>Amane thought that he should probably have tried to play it a little smoother, but it
        <p></p>was too late for that now. The one possible saving grace was that Mahiru didn't seem
        <p></p>to have realized that this was about her birthday. As far as she knew, Amane should've
        <p></p>had no way of knowing her date of birth. Hopefully, that would keep her from catching
        <p></p>on.
        <p></p>"Well, let's see, there is one thing I need. I guess that's what I want right now."
        <p></p>"What do you want?"
        <p></p>"A whetstone."
        <p></p>"A… whetstone?"
        <p></p>Unconsciously, Amane repeated Mahiru's words, because the girl's answer had been
        <p></p>far too unexpected.
        <p></p>No one could've expected that kind of answer from a high school girl. Normally, you'd
        <p></p>think they would want cosmetics, or accessories, or bags, or something like that, Amane
        <p></p>thought. He would never in his wildest dreams have expected a girl to want a tool for
        <p></p>sharpening metal.
        <p></p>"That's right, a whetstone. I already have several, but I want one with a finer finishing
        <p></p>surface, you see," Mahiru explained.
        <p></p>"Are you sure you're really an ordinary high school girl?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Please don't expect me to be ordinary."
        <p></p>It was difficult for Amane to object to that. Mahiru could not be called an ordinary high
        <p></p>schooler, by any standard. Describing her as an angel seemed entirely accurate.
        <p></p>Mahiru was a prodigy who was good at school and sports. What's more, she was an
        <p></p>excellent cook and a skilled housekeeper. As if that wasn't enough, Mahiru was a noble
        <p></p>young lady who spent so much time taking care of a slob like Amane that she could've
        <p></p>been mistaken for a married woman.
        <p></p>Still, who could have imagined she'd want something like a whetstone?
        <p></p>Mahiru had to be the only high school girl in the whole world who wanted such a thing.
        <p></p>"You can't buy it yourself?" Amane wondered aloud. She was well-off, after all.
        <p></p>"It's not exactly that I can't buy it, you know. It's just—I won't have that many
        <p></p>opportunities to use it, and it's pretty expensive. After considering all that, I couldn't
        <p></p>really justify the purchase. I already have one that can put a decent edge on, so I keep
        <p></p>telling myself that I don't really need it."
        <p></p>Amane had to admit that it was more than a bit frightening to know that Mahiru
        <p></p>owned several whetstones already.
        <p></p>"…How many high school girls out there sharpen their own kitchen knives?" he asked.
        <p></p>"Quite a few," Mahiru replied.
        <p></p>"Even if there are, you're the only one I know, and you're also the only one who wants
        <p></p>another whetstone."
        <p></p>"Well, I suppose it's nice to be unique."
        <p></p>"If you say so…"
        <p></p>This certainly was an angel with unusual interests. Amane couldn't make heads or tails
        <p></p>of her.
        <p></p>Mahiru tilted her head in confusion as Amane stood there looking baffled. He'd
        <p></p>completely lost sight of his original objective.
        <p></p>"Hey, Itsuki?"
        <p></p>After completely failing to decide on a gift that Mahiru might appreciate, Amane had
        <p></p>decided instead to consult with his best friend. Itsuki had a way with women's hearts,
        <p></p>as well as a girlfriend to consult, so Amane expected that he would probably have
        <p></p>some grasp on what a girl would normally want. While he wasn't really sure it was a
        <p></p>good idea to try to apply normal standards to someone like Mahiru, he expected that
        <p></p>she wouldn't outright hate things that made someone else's girlfriend happy.
        <p></p>"What's up?" Itsuki replied.
        <p></p>"When you give Chitose presents, what do you usually get her?"
        <p></p>Amane thought it would be best to start by asking what Itsuki bought for his girl, but
        <p></p>all he got back was a blank stare.
        <p></p>"Huh, you planning on giving a present to some sweetheart of yours?"
        <p></p>"Do you think I have it in me to do something like that?"
        <p></p>"Nope."
        <p></p>"All right, then."
        <p></p>"In that case, why are you asking?"
        <p></p>"Someone I know has a birthday coming up, so I wanted to ask you."
        <p></p>While Amane was planning on listening to Itsuki's advice with the utmost attention,
        <p></p>he was also keen not to reveal too much about his own circumstances.
        <p></p>"Hmm… for starters, you should try finding out what they want. You know, it's
        <p></p>important to do that sort of research on a regular basis. It's the secret to a harmonious
        <p></p>relationship, I'm telling you," said Itsuki.
        <p></p>"I told you that this isn't for a girlfriend," Amane reminded.
        <p></p>Setting aside the potential grave danger the other boys at school would pose to
        <p></p>Amane's physical safety if word ever got around, Mahiru was too awe-inspiring to even
        <p></p>consider asking out in the first place.
        <p></p>Sure, he was comfortable hanging around with her, and they got along well enough as
        <p></p>two frank individuals, but there were absolutely no romantic feelings between them.
        <p></p>Sure, she was cute, but that didn't mean Amane wanted a relationship.
        <p></p>"What they want, huh…? And what if you don't know?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Depends on how close you are. If you're good friends, an accessory or something is
        <p></p>good, but if you're not close, something practical that they can use is a safer bet. There
        <p></p>are lots of girls who're happy to get flowers but don't know what to do when they
        <p></p>receive them," Itsuki explained.
        <p></p>"…You sure know your stuff."
        <p></p>"Well, I've done a fair bit of research, I guess."
        <p></p>Itsuki and Chitose hadn't always been so wild about each other. Their relationship had
        <p></p>slowly developed, first starting in middle school. Amane had gone to a different middle
        <p></p>school, so he didn't really know all the details, but apparently, they'd gone through a
        <p></p>lot together, and their relationship had grown from those experiences to the point
        <p></p>where these days, they wouldn't shut up about each other.
        <p></p>To hear him tell it, Itsuki had also been fairly lost the first time he'd had to give Chitose
        <p></p>a present, so Amane figured he could benefit from his friend's experience.
        <p></p>"Oh, and no girl hates hand cream," Itsuki added.
        <p></p>"Hand cream?"
        <p></p>As Amane was pondering this unexpected option, Itsuki grinned and explained
        <p></p>proudly, "No matter what age they are, every girl has some use for it. If she's a student,
        <p></p>her hands get dry from handling notebooks and textbooks in class; if she's in the
        <p></p>workforce, her hands dry out from typing and air conditioning; and housewives cook
        <p></p>and clean, so their hands take a beating, too. You can't go wrong with that stuff."
        <p></p>"Hmm. You sure know an awful lot about women's hands…," Amane said.
        <p></p>"You're the one who came and asked me!" Itsuki snapped.
        <p></p>Itsuki slapped Amane on the back, but there was no power behind it. The two friends
        <p></p>shared a laugh.
        <p></p>Hand cream, huh? I guess that is a pretty safe bet.
        <p></p>Amane had been taking the initiative on washing the dishes after dinner, but Mahiru
        <p></p>obviously did her own dishes at home, so he could imagine her hands could use some
        <p></p>moisturizing. More importantly, Amane was sure she took care of her hands already,
        <p></p>since they were so smooth. A gift she could use right away really was the best plan.
        <p></p>"Cool, thanks for your thoughts," Amane said.
        <p></p>"Let's try asking Chi, too. As a fellow girl, she probably has a better idea," proposed
        <p></p>Itsuki.
        <p></p>"…Eh…"
        <p></p>"You gotta warm up to her."
        <p></p>Amane certainly didn't hate her, but Chitose was not exactly his favorite type of girl,
        <p></p>and being around her always made him feel awkward. Usually, he tried to avoid
        <p></p>interacting with her altogether. Itsuki slapped Amane's back again gently, smiling in
        <p></p>amusement.
        <p></p>"Whaaa—? Amane, you're giving a girl a birthday present?" Chitose was smiling—no,
        <p></p>smirking—at this rare development, and it was all Amane could do not to grimace.
        <p></p>He had gone to Chitose's classroom to talk to her after school, and sure enough, she
        <p></p>seemed greatly amused. Incidentally, Itsuki had sent Chitose a message saying that he
        <p></p>wasn't worried about her being alone with another boy as long as it was Amane, so he
        <p></p>had gone on home. Amane had sighed softly, while Chitose had worn a wide grin.
        <p></p>I told him I didn't want to ask her.
        <p></p>It was obvious that she was definitely going to pry and ridicule him, so he hadn't
        <p></p>intended to turn to her for help at all. Amane certainly didn't hate Chitose, but he
        <p></p>couldn't deny that there were some things about her that he just couldn't stand.
        <p></p>"Okay, so Itsuki wrote here that 'Amane was hoping you'd give him some pointers.' So
        <p></p>you want my help, huh?"
        <p></p>"You're the only girl I can ask, Chi."
        <p></p>"It doesn't sound very nice when you put it like that, you know." Chitose looked at
        <p></p>Amane with clear pity, but he let it pass.
        <p></p>The truth was, Amane had no female friends outside of Chitose. Every single girl in his
        <p></p>class barely counted as acquaintances, and he wasn't close enough to any of them to
        <p></p>be able to ask for help with things like this.
        <p></p>Actually, Amane was usually rather quiet in school. If one of his female classmates
        <p></p>tried to talk to him, he probably wouldn't know what to do.
        <p></p>"All right, well, I can't imagine you really understand how girls think, Amane. But don't
        <p></p>worry! Miss Chitose is here to advise you!"
        <p></p>"…I guess I'm in your hands," Amane said.
        <p></p>"You guess? What's to guess? I may not look it, but I know women's hearts perfectly!"
        <p></p>"I mean, you are a girl, after all… I guess."
        <p></p>"Watch it with those guesses, buddy! I'm not sure I like what you're implying!"
        <p></p>Chitose cleared her throat and thrust out her chest. Compared to Mahiru, who Amane
        <p></p>saw every day, the result was underwhelming at best. Amane awkwardly stared at the
        <p></p>ground.
        <p></p>Regardless of what he personally thought, Chitose was popular with guys. Personalitywise, she was cheerful and friendly, and she talked to everyone without playing
        <p></p>favorites, so hers was a different kind of popularity than Mahiru's. She got along with
        <p></p>boys and girls alike. She really was the epitome of a life-of-the-party kind of person.
        <p></p>She had apparently been a member of the track-and-field club in middle school, and
        <p></p>her slender build and toned legs certainly didn't hurt her popularity. It was a verifiable
        <p></p>fact that her legs were beautiful, so much so that Itsuki had warned other guys in
        <p></p>school that he'd get angry if they stared at her too much.
        <p></p>"Ah, right, right," Chitose chittered. "Something for a cute girl, let's see…"
        <p></p>There were definitely times when she got too friendly, but Amane wouldn't deny that
        <p></p>Chitose was cute. He could understand why other guys in school liked her.
        <p></p>"…You know," Chitose added, "that glum attitude of yours is seriously gonna give
        <p></p>people the wrong idea."
        <p></p>"Gee, thanks for your concern," Amane replied.
        <p></p>"Fine, fine. So you're giving something to a girl, right? Well, what kind of girl?"
        <p></p>Chitose's question didn't leave him much room to maneuver, but Amane knew that if
        <p></p>he was careless with what he told her, she wouldn't let him live it down, so he chose
        <p></p>his words gingerly.
        <p></p>"She's an acquaintance of mine, and she's relatively young. Beyond that, I'm exercising
        <p></p>my right to remain silent."
        <p></p>"Uh… if you won't tell me her about her personality or what she likes, even I can't come
        <p></p>up with any ideas, you know."
        <p></p>"Can't you just tell me some things that you would like to get as a gift? Then I'll choose
        <p></p>from among them."
        <p></p>"I get it; you don't want to tell me anything about her. Fine, we'll do it your way."
        <p></p>Chitose made a good point, but if he told her any more, she would know that Amane
        <p></p>was close to a girl their age, and it was likely that the conversation would veer off in a
        <p></p>strange and uncomfortable direction from there. If he really slipped up, Chitose might
        <p></p>even end up figuring out that he was talking about Mahiru.
        <p></p>Amane wanted to avoid that if at all possible, so he'd decided not to tell her anything
        <p></p>that wasn't strictly necessary. Chitose also seemed to understand that he wouldn't
        <p></p>willingly reveal much more, and thankfully, she was kind enough to back off on the
        <p></p>questions.
        <p></p>"Hmm, let's see… I don't know what type of relationship you have with her, but if she's
        <p></p>an acquaintance you speak with fairly often, I'm assuming she would be happy to
        <p></p>receive something from a person who's about as close to her as I am to you. In that
        <p></p>case, generally a consumable or everyday item that's not too expensive should be good."
        <p></p>"Itsuki told me pretty much the same thing," Amane said.
        <p></p>"Obviously. He understands how girls think. Now, if you're looking for a casual gift,
        <p></p>some sweets and a handkerchief or some small item might be good. If I got an
        <p></p>expensive accessory from you, Amane, I'd totally be like 'A bribe?!' or something."
        <p></p>"I don't think I would get anything out of bribing you, though."
        <p></p>After shooting Amane a glance that seemed to be asking for some sort of recompense
        <p></p>for her help, Chitose smiled and answered, "Well, you've got that right. Anyway, little
        <p></p>things like that are safe."
        <p></p>"…Gotcha."
        <p></p>"You sound kinda unsatisfied." Chitose cocked her head.
        <p></p>"It's not that I'm not satisfied, but…" Amane trailed off. In truth, he just wasn't sure
        <p></p>that Mahiru would appreciate the sort of gift that he would select. She probably had
        <p></p>impeccable taste, and she seemed like the type to choose things that combined quality
        <p></p>and functionality. Amane wasn't sure if his choice would measure up.
        <p></p>Chitose could sense a slight hesitation in Amane's demeanor, and she hummed a bit to
        <p></p>herself. "…Let's see… Another option might be… something cute?"
        <p></p>"…Such as?"
        <p></p>"Depends on the person's tastes. For example, a stuffed animal or a keychain with an
        <p></p>adorable character on it. I think giving her something like that might work."
        <p></p>Amane blinked back at Chitose after hearing the unexpected suggestion, and Chitose
        <p></p>smiled knowingly. "Most girls enjoy cute things, you see. There are even some people
        <p></p>who keep collecting stuffed animals long after they grow up, and lots of girls like them
        <p></p>in general, right?"
        <p></p>"…A stuffed animal, huh…?" Amane didn't know whether Mahiru had any girly
        <p></p>interests, but she did wear clothes decorated with cute frills and ornaments, so she
        <p></p>probably didn't hate cuter things like stuffed animals.
        <p></p>Amane could certainly imagine Mahiru being happy to receive a plush toy.
        <p></p>"Oh, do I sense some interest?" Chitose smirked. Apparently, she had caught the
        <p></p>minute change that had come over Amane. He nodded, though he was still unsure, and
        <p></p>let out a small sigh.
        <p></p>"…But it'll be too weird for me to buy a stuffed animal, I think," Amane admitted.
        <p></p>"It's a present; you're not buying it for yourself. What's the problem?" Chitose asked.
        <p></p>"I mean, a guy my age, carrying a stuffed animal to the register…?"
        <p></p>"You really are pathetic, you know that?"
        <p></p>"Mm-hmm."
        <p></p>There was no denying it, but it still hurt Amane to hear it. He ought to be able to get
        <p></p>over such a petty hang-up, but even walking into a store that carried stuffed animals
        <p></p>by himself was enough to make him feel embarrassed.
        <p></p>Fortunately, Chitose was with him today. Amane thought he might be able to convince
        <p></p>her to accompany him to a shop on the way home. It certainly wasn't out of the question,
        <p></p>but…
        <p></p>"…Chitose, come with me," said Amane.
        <p></p>"Whatcha mean?"
        <p></p>"…Please accompany me to go shopping."
        <p></p>"Hmm, I wonder if I should…" It was just like Chitose to tease him like this.
        <p></p>Of course, she didn't really have any intention of refusing Amane's request, but there
        <p></p>could be no doubt that she was putting on a deliberate act, both to make fun of Amane
        <p></p>and to force him to beg for her help.
        <p></p>"I'm asking you, please. I'm really counting on you," Amane pleaded.
        <p></p>"Mmm, I guess I could go… By the way, Amane, I feel like eating something sweet. And
        <p></p>the crepe stand in front of the station has a super-delicious-looking limited-time
        <p></p>item…"
        <p></p>"…Please allow me to treat you."
        <p></p>"Yay!"
        <p></p>Amane grimaced at Chitose's clever manipulation, but he realized it was a small price
        <p></p>to pay for her help. It was way better to pay for one crepe than to go into a cutesy shop
        <p></p>all on his own. Amane let out a powerful sigh as he looked at Chitose, who was grinning
        <p></p>impishly, then mentally calculated his approximate budget based on what was in his
        <p></p>wallet.
        <p></p>After consulting Itsuki and Chitose, Amane had at last made a decision on what to give
        <p></p>Mahiru for her birthday. Staring at the back of the girl in question, a nervous
        <p></p>expression overtook Amane's face.
        <p></p>As compensation for a deluxe crepe from the shop in front of the station, the
        <p></p>Wintertime Limited Edition Berry Berry Special to be exact, Amane had asked Chitose
        <p></p>for one more thing. It and the actual present were now sitting in a bag together. The
        <p></p>problem was that Amane was completely at a loss for when he should give the gift to
        <p></p>Mahiru.
        <p></p>The birthday girl was fixing dinner as usual, with no change in demeanor.
        <p></p>Amane didn't know what was on the menu, but it had the air of Japanese food and
        <p></p>certainly didn't seem like anything special. She seemed relaxed as she went about her
        <p></p>preparations.
        <p></p>Mahiru had made no indication at all that today was anything but another regular day.
        <p></p>She was acting so normal that Amane wondered if perhaps she even knew.
        <p></p>As Mahiru started setting the table, Amane couldn't help but notice that her face
        <p></p>remained completely unchanged. The two ate an extremely typical dinner and held a
        <p></p>totally normal conversation. Through it all, Amane remained completely unsure of
        <p></p>when best to present her with the gifts he'd gotten. Frowning, he glanced in the
        <p></p>direction of the paper bag hidden behind his sofa.
        <p></p>He decided to wait until they had cleaned up after dinner and returned to the living
        <p></p>room, when he could take a seat beside Mahiru on his two-person sofa. She'd brought
        <p></p>some books to look over after their meal, so that seemed as good a time as any.
        <p></p>True to her nickname, the angel was just as beautiful when she was reading.
        <p></p>Without knowing why, Amane hesitated a little to sit next to her, but even if he
        <p></p>hesitated, there was no way around it, so he grabbed the paper gift bag from its hiding
        <p></p>place and sat down next to Mahiru.
        <p></p>Immediately, the girl's head snapped up. Whether she'd noticed Amane's presence or
        <p></p>heard the sound of the crinkling paper bag was unclear. Either way, her caramelcolored eyes turned toward Amane before shifting to what he was holding.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked confused, as if she still hadn't realized that this was about her birthday.
        <p></p>"Here. For you." Amane placed the bag on Mahiru's knees, and the girl's expression
        <p></p>grew even more puzzled.
        <p></p>"What is this?" she asked.
        <p></p>"It's your birthday, right?"
        <p></p>"That's true… but wait, how did you know that? I don't remember telling anyone."
        <p></p>Mahiru was suddenly on guard.
        <p></p>"Remember when you dropped your school ID in my apartment?" Amane reminded
        <p></p>her.
        <p></p>She seemed to understand, and her normal expression returned. "I really wish you
        <p></p>hadn't gone to the trouble. I… don't celebrate my birthday."
        <p></p>Amane was certain that he'd heard a bit of cold detachment in Mahiru's voice when
        <p></p>she spoke. The look in her eyes told him that even the word birthday was something
        <p></p>she avoided.
        <p></p>I see, he thought. So the reason why she didn't act any differently, even though it's her
        <p></p>birthday, wasn't because she forgot… She's been purposely ignoring it. Something about
        <p></p>it must bother her.
        <p></p>Amane figured that if that wasn't the case, Mahiru wouldn't have spoken like that.
        <p></p>"Okay then, call it an expression of gratitude for everything you do for me. I just
        <p></p>decided to give you something to repay you."
        <p></p>Setting aside any mention of Mahiru's birthday, Amane pressed the bag on her,
        <p></p>justifying it as his way of thanking her for her daily kindnesses. She cooked delicious
        <p></p>meals for him every evening and helped him with his cleaning sometimes. When it
        <p></p>came down to it, Mahiru did a lot to take care of Amane. He wanted to repay that debt
        <p></p>in whatever small way possible.
        <p></p>Amane held out the present to Mahiru, but she shrank away. First, she looked confused,
        <p></p>then she frowned at Amane's determination. Finally, she accepted the gift bag.
        <p></p>"…Well, can I open it?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"Yeah," Amane said.
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded and gingerly pulled out the box that was inside the paper bag, then
        <p></p>she carefully untied the ribbon and removed the wrapping paper.
        <p></p>Something about watching Mahiru open the gift made Amane extremely nervous.
        <p></p>Inside the box was the hand cream Itsuki had suggested. It was nestled in a largish box
        <p></p>alongside some sweets. Apparently, it'd been some kind of set. It wasn't the kind of
        <p></p>hand cream that smelled particularly nice, nor was it all that stylish. Instead, it was
        <p></p>the scentless kind that was gentle on the skin. That way, it wouldn't cause any trouble
        <p></p>while doing housework. This was the sort that was advertised as moisture-retaining.
        <p></p>Amane had made sure to check the reviews of the product on the Internet, so he was
        <p></p>certain of its efficacy.
        <p></p>"Yeah, sorry it's nothing too crazy. I just thought that since you do a lot of housework,
        <p></p>your hands might get dry. They had scented ones, too, but I thought you might have
        <p></p>some of those already. Apparently, it's effective and easy on the skin."
        <p></p>"It is… quite practical," Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"I thought you would value practicality over anything else," answered Amane.
        <p></p>"Yeah, you're right. Thank you very much." Mahiru smiled slightly, as if she understood
        <p></p>Amane's reasoning. A little less nervous now, Amane's expression softened a bit as
        <p></p>well. It seemed like he'd made a good impression.
        <p></p>There was one more present, though, and Amane felt embarrassed to have Mahiru
        <p></p>open this one in front of him for some reason. He'd hoped that she would only notice
        <p></p>it after she had gone back home.
        <p></p>However, Mahiru was peering into the paper bag, looking as if she had already noticed
        <p></p>that there was one more thing hiding within it.
        <p></p>"…What, a second one?" she asked.
        <p></p>"Ah. Yeah, there is. It's a bonus; I picked it out myself," Amane answered.
        <p></p>"What does that mean?"
        <p></p>"…Exactly what I said."
        <p></p>Amane averted his eyes. Mahiru tilted her head in confusion for an instant, then
        <p></p>promptly pulled the second gift from the bag.
        <p></p>To purposefully disguise this other present, Amane had intentionally wrapped it in
        <p></p>paper the same color as the interior of the bag. He'd hoped that would make it stand
        <p></p>out less—and that Mahiru would only notice it later when he wasn't around.
        <p></p>Unfortunately, it was large enough that Amane should've known it would be
        <p></p>impossible to miss. There was honestly no way Mahiru could have overlooked it.
        <p></p>Unlike the hand cream, this present didn't come in a box, just a polyester bag. It was
        <p></p>just about the right size to fit comfortably in Mahiru's arms. The bag was tied up with
        <p></p>a navy-blue ribbon, and Amane watched Mahiru undo that carefully as well,
        <p></p>wondering if it would be all right for him to stand up from his seat. Finally, Mahiru
        <p></p>carefully pulled out what lay inside.
        <p></p>She held the bag's contents up gently with both hands, blinking her large eyes
        <p></p>dramatically, looking truly surprised.
        <p></p>"…A bear?" Mahiru mumbled.
        <p></p>It was a stuffed animal. Not too large, it was perfectly proportioned for an elementary
        <p></p>school student. Its light-colored fur was soft, much like Mahiru's own hair. A light-blue
        <p></p>ribbon was tied around the toy's neck to form a collar. It had a rather cherubic look
        <p></p>stitched onto its face, and the round, cute button eyes had a luster to them that
        <p></p>reflected Mahiru's face as they stared at her.
        <p></p>Doubtless, the girl was wondering why Amane had given her such a thing when she
        <p></p>was in high school. The truth was that Amane had taken a risk and chosen it based on
        <p></p>Chitose's advice that girls liked cute things no matter how old they were.
        <p></p>Of course, he had been much too embarrassed to go buy the bear alone, so Chitose had
        <p></p>come with him to make the purchase, though only in exchange for the deluxe crepe
        <p></p>from the shop in front of the station.
        <p></p>Chitose's smiling face had loomed over Amane throughout the whole process of
        <p></p>buying the bear and getting it wrapped. In the end, he couldn't help but think it
        <p></p>might've been better if he'd just gone alone. Though, there was nothing he could do
        <p></p>about it now.
        <p></p>"…I thought it looked like something a girl would like," Amane mumbled to no one in
        <p></p>particular, scratching his head. He was terrible at stuff like this.
        <p></p>The last time he'd gotten a present for a member of the opposite sex was when he'd
        <p></p>given gifts to his mother as a little kid. Amane had never once thought he'd have to
        <p></p>pick something out for a girl.
        <p></p>So it doesn't faze her to get a cute stuffed animal from a boy, huh…?
        <p></p>Risking a quick glance at Mahiru, Amane saw her staring directly into the bear's face.
        <p></p>He couldn't tell from her expression whether she was happy, only that her eyes were
        <p></p>fixed on the stuffed animal.
        <p></p>"I mean… If you don't like it, you can just toss it," Amane said, hoping to diffuse the
        <p></p>situation with some light humor.
        <p></p>Mahiru turned sharply toward him and drew her eyebrows tightly into a frown. "I
        <p></p>would never!"
        <p></p>"S-sure, I, uh, didn't think you would or anything."
        <p></p>The response had been so absolute that Amane couldn't help but flinch and barely
        <p></p>managed to nod in answer. Mahiru looked back at the bear in her hands again.
        <p></p>"…I would never do such a cruel thing. I'll treasure it." Slender arms embraced the
        <p></p>stuffed bear, as if to wrap it up entirely. Amane couldn't decide if Mahiru looked more
        <p></p>like a child with a favorite toy or a mother protecting an infant. Either way, she
        <p></p>certainly embraced the bear enthusiastically, looking down at the thing as though it
        <p></p>were the most precious object in the world.
        <p></p>Mahiru's face was not the stony mask she kept up at school, nor was it the face she
        <p></p>often wore when she was exasperated with Amane. This time it was peaceful, soft, and
        <p></p>somewhat affectionate—an unmistakably sweet expression.
        <p></p>Amane felt an innocence in her, and her pure smile was beautiful enough to take his
        <p></p>breath away. She was really exceptionally cute.
        <p></p>I shouldn't be staring, Amane thought. Mahiru was liable to notice if he kept looking at
        <p></p>her like that.
        <p></p>Amane was certain that he wasn't in love, but seeing a beautiful girl make a face like
        <p></p>that, and knowing that he was the cause of it, undeniably made his heart throb. She
        <p></p>looked so adorable as she sat there with a faint smile, hugging the stuffed animal to
        <p></p>her chest. Anyone who saw her would've been captivated by the sight. Amane certainly
        <p></p>was, despite his usual reservations.
        <p></p>Just pressing a palm to her face would've made it immediately apparent how much
        <p></p>warmer it was than usual. Embarrassed after being so open with her emotions, she
        <p></p>swore under her breath. "…Damn." The word was so quiet it could barely be heard.
        <p></p>Fortunately, Mahiru did not seem to have noticed how Amane was looking at her,
        <p></p>because her face was half-buried in the stuffed animal that she was clutching to her
        <p></p>chest.
        <p></p>She still looked extremely sweet, and Amane was worried he would say something
        <p></p>strange in spite of himself.
        <p></p>"…I'm really glad you like it." Thankfully, Amane managed to keep what he said brief.
        <p></p>Quickly, Mahiru turned to face him. "This is the first time I've ever received something
        <p></p>like this."
        <p></p>"Huh? With how popular you are, I thought you'd be getting presents like this all the
        <p></p>time…"
        <p></p>"What do you take me for…?" It came as a relief to see Mahiru's usual behavior return,
        <p></p>but that was only because Amane couldn't see her current expression behind the bear.
        <p></p>"…I never told anyone when my birthday was," Mahiru continued, looking back down
        <p></p>at the stuffed animal. "I hate that day, so I don't really share it."
        <p></p>Mahiru's expression softened as she looked at her gift, though her words remained
        <p></p>sharp. The apparent dissonance set Amane on edge a bit.
        <p></p>"Normally, I hate getting presents from strangers, so I don't accept them," Mahiru
        <p></p>explained.
        <p></p>"You're accepting this, though," Amane said.
        <p></p>"…Fujimiya…," Mahiru said quietly, "you're not a stranger."
        <p></p>Face still half-buried in fur, Mahiru looked up toward Amane again. She wore a dreamy,
        <p></p>innocent expression. It was captivating, and as Amane gazed at the angel sitting on his
        <p></p>couch, he realized he was in trouble.
        <p></p>Mahiru was so cute that Amane found himself reaching unbidden to stroke her hair,
        <p></p>and he had to quickly stuff his hand behind his back before he did something really
        <p></p>awkward.
        <p></p>…That was close! If Amane had let his guard down, he probably would've started
        <p></p>patting Mahiru on the head right then and there. Doing something so inappropriate
        <p></p>would have destroyed everything he'd built with her.
        <p></p>"…What is it?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"N-nothing," Amane replied shyly.
        <p></p>Perhaps Mahiru had seen his arm move, or maybe she'd noticed his obvious distress
        <p></p>as he struggled to keep his alarming feelings from bubbling to the surface. Mahiru's
        <p></p>head tilted to one side in puzzlement. That simple movement was enough to leave
        <p></p>Amane speechless, and it occurred to him that beautiful girls possessed a terrifying
        <p></p>power. Still, he felt embarrassed for being so captivated by Mahiru's cuteness. He was
        <p></p>also confident that if he told her how he felt, she would just be confused.
        <p></p>Something about the feeling instilled a sense of danger in Amane, and he did his best
        <p></p>to push it deep down.
        <p></p>"…Thank you very much, Fujimiya," Mahiru said in a soft voice, but Amane had already
        <p></p>turned away from her.
        <p></p>"Hey, hey, Amane, how'd it go with that girl you got the present for?"
        <p></p>Obviously Chitose was going to pry, since Amane had convinced her to come along
        <p></p>shopping with him. The day after Mahiru's birthday, Amane was confronted by
        <p></p>Chitose's grinning inquiry.
        <p></p>Chitose was in a different class but had come to his classroom after school. That alone
        <p></p>wasn't much of an issue, but hers was the sort of smile that made Amane feel like she
        <p></p>was up to something. Today especially, he felt the urge to turn and run.
        <p></p>"Nothing happened—at least, not anything like you're imagining," Amane answered.
        <p></p>It was the truth. He definitely wasn't holding on to any amorous feelings, and he hadn't
        <p></p>given Mahiru the present because he hoped it would lead to the start of something
        <p></p>more. Sure, she'd graciously accepted the gifts, but there had certainly been no
        <p></p>romantic developments of the kind that Chitose anticipated.
        <p></p>"Now hold on," Itsuki interrupted, "The fact that you were so concerned about
        <p></p>someone at all is a pretty rare thing, you know. You suddenly have some acquaintance
        <p></p>that you seem involved with, and it's a girl. Very suspicious."
        <p></p>"It's nothing like that." Amane knew he had to shut this down now. He was happy that
        <p></p>Mahiru had been pleased with her gifts, but he was starting to think that bringing
        <p></p>other people into the situation was more trouble than it'd been worth.
        <p></p>Not wanting to feed their curiosity anymore, Amane had answered as bluntly as
        <p></p>possible, but Itsuki had his hand to his mouth, as if he was pondering something.
        <p></p>"…Hmm… say, Amane?"
        <p></p>"What is it?"
        <p></p>"Is it possible that the person you gave the present to is… your neighbor?"
        <p></p>Itsuki was smart and very perceptive, which at times like these could be a real pain.
        <p></p>"…What makes you think that?" Amane asked nervously.
        <p></p>"Well, she's the only person I could think of that bothers taking care of you. And you're
        <p></p>not from around here, so you don't know many people. Plus, you don't hang out with
        <p></p>many girls. She brought you dinner that other day, right? I was thinking that maybe
        <p></p>this was about you wanting to return the favor."
        <p></p>"Well…"
        <p></p>"Hmm… Amane has been looking very healthy recently, right, Chi?"
        <p></p>"Oh, I thought so, too."
        <p></p>"She must be bringing him meals pretty frequently, huh? I wonder if that's why he
        <p></p>wanted to give her a birthday present, to thank her?"
        <p></p>Amane fought to maintain a blank expression as Itsuki perfectly described the
        <p></p>situation to Chitose. It was so accurate that it was like he had been there to watch it all
        <p></p>go down. Sometimes Itsuki was scary like that. Amane could see why his friend was
        <p></p>so popular. He was a bit of a show-off but also smart and thoughtful. Amane just
        <p></p>wished Itsuki would save the grandstanding for his girlfriend.
        <p></p>"What an overactive imagination…," Amane interjected.
        <p></p>"Well, you won't fess up, so imaginations are all we've got. C'mon, spill it!" Itsuki pressed.
        <p></p>"Who knows…?"
        <p></p>"You're holdin' out on us!"
        <p></p>"So stingy!" Chitose chimed in agreement.
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>No matter what anyone said, Amane wasn't planning on confirming the truth. If he let
        <p></p>anything slip, Itsuki and Chitose would never stop hounding him until he'd spit out
        <p></p>the whole story. Really, Itsuki was only the tip of the iceberg; Amane was in the
        <p></p>presence of a high school girl who loved gossip, especially when it came to romantic
        <p></p>affairs. While there wasn't the slightest bit of romance to be found here, if Chitose got
        <p></p>one whiff of the person involved, Amane would never hear the end of it.
        <p></p>Sighing in exasperation, Amane finished packing his things and shouldered his
        <p></p>backpack. He'd decided on a strategic retreat, before his two friends gave him
        <p></p>heartburn.
        <p></p>"See ya. You two can go ahead and flirt all you like in private," Amane said.
        <p></p>"We were gonna do that whether you said to or not!" Itsuki shouted.
        <p></p>"…Itsuki, weren't we gonna tail him and try to meet the girl in question…?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, uh, you probably shouldn't discuss your operation in front of the target… And
        <p></p>anyway, there's nothing to see. Even if there was, you two would never make it past
        <p></p>the lobby!" Amane scolded.
        <p></p>"Tch!" Chitose's lips curled into a cute pout, but her eyes were serious. Apparently, she
        <p></p>really had been planning on tailing Amane. Nervously hurrying out of the room,
        <p></p>Amane left his friends behind.
        <p></p>"…That was a close one," Amane grumbled without thinking.
        <p></p>"What was?" Mahiru asked him curiously.
        <p></p>It was still a little early to make dinner, but Amane and Mahiru had gone shopping and
        <p></p>come back to his apartment. They'd been relaxing for a bit, when Mahiru overheard
        <p></p>Amane talking to himself.
        <p></p>Mahiru had been acting the same as usual; there was no trace of the girl who'd been
        <p></p>so enamored with the stuffed bear. The same placid expression remained, and Amane
        <p></p>wondered if perhaps he'd dreamed up the whole birthday incident. Actually, he
        <p></p>preferred her this way. He wasn't sure his heart could stand regularly seeing her look
        <p></p>at him the way she had the other day.
        <p></p>"Ah, well, Itsuki and Chitose were suspicious about the present."
        <p></p>Amane intended to explain that he'd consulted them about the present, but Mahiru
        <p></p>seemed to remember Itsuki's name, and she exhaled, saying "Ah, I see" as if she
        <p></p>understood.
        <p></p>"Well, it didn't seem like the sort of thing you would buy on your own."
        <p></p>"That's not what I was concerned about…"
        <p></p>Apparently, no one thought Amane was capable of getting a gift for a girl. If he was
        <p></p>being honest, he really didn't think he'd ever experience the many sweet and bitter
        <p></p>feelings that were supposed to accompany love all at once.
        <p></p>"My shopping is my business. Why does everyone think that way about me anyway?"
        <p></p>Certainly, Mahiru was cute, and yesterday he'd felt a desire to reach out and touch her.
        <p></p>That much he couldn't deny, but what young man wouldn't have felt that way? Mahiru
        <p></p>was outrageously beautiful, after all. Amane had been caught up in her beauty; that
        <p></p>was all. Nothing about what had happened was evidence he had any deeper feelings.
        <p></p>Mahiru was a great person, but Amane was not interested in her like that.
        <p></p>He glanced over at Mahiru. She was just as beautiful as ever, but Amane's heart didn't
        <p></p>pound like it had the night before. Once again, he reminded himself that he didn't care
        <p></p>for Mahiru in any meaningful way.
        <p></p>Worried that Mahiru would say something if she caught Amane staring at her, he
        <p></p>looked down at his phone instead. When he did, he realized he'd received a ton of new
        <p></p>texts. Thinking it was probably Itsuki, Amane decided to check them, but it turned out
        <p></p>they hadn't come from his friend.
        <p></p>Amane frowned at the sender's name: SHIHOKO.
        <p></p>She was one of only three female contacts in Amane's phone. There was Chitose,
        <p></p>Mahiru, and… Amane's mother.
        <p></p>Wondering what she could possibly want, Amane tapped the message thread. He
        <p></p>hated dealing with his mother's high-strung questions, always asking him how exams
        <p></p>were going or whether he needed anything. He could barely handle Chitose, and yet
        <p></p>some members of his family were just like her. In fact, Chitose might become very
        <p></p>much like Amane's mother as she got older. Shihoko wasn't so bad that Amane outright
        <p></p>hated her, but he couldn't stand his mother's personality.
        <p></p>"I brought some fruit back from Grandfather's, so I'm going to share it with you, Amane.
        <p></p>I'm sending it over, so be at your place on Saturday afternoon! I won't forgive you if you
        <p></p>refuse delivery or aren't there to get it, okay?"
        <p></p>"So you can just decide my plans all on your own…?" Amane muttered. Now, he didn't
        <p></p>actually have any plans for Saturday, but he thought his mother ought to have at least
        <p></p>contacted him a little earlier.
        <p></p>"Did something happen?" Mahiru must have heard Amane's whisperings, because she
        <p></p>looked over at him with her usual calm expression.
        <p></p>"My mom picked some fruit at my grandpa's place, and she's sending it here on
        <p></p>Saturday afternoon. Probably apples and stuff," Amane explained.
        <p></p>"Do you peel your apples?"
        <p></p>"…I guess I could do that, with a peeler."
        <p></p>"That would peel them, but… it'll take off a lot of the flesh, too, so it's a little wasteful."
        <p></p>Mahiru's words sounded like something Amane's mother would say, and he tried to
        <p></p>swallow that thought before it surfaced.
        <p></p>"If it comes down to it, we can just eat them whole," he said.
        <p></p>"How savage."
        <p></p>"It's a pain to peel them." Amane shrugged and grinned haplessly.
        <p></p>"You're such a mess." Despite Mahiru sounding annoyed and giving a rather brutal
        <p></p>assessment of Amane's table manners, the way she held herself also showed some
        <p></p>understanding. "I guess it's all the same once you eat them."
        <p></p>"You know, I'm not sure I'll be able to eat them all before they go bad. Do you want
        <p></p>some, too?" asked Amane.
        <p></p>"Sure, I'd be happy to take some. Fruit is expensive, after all." It was kind of a domestic
        <p></p>thing to say, but then again, that was the kind of person Mahiru was.
        <p></p>"Saturday, right? In that case, I'll make us lunch beforehand as thanks," Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"But you're always taking care of me already," Amane protested.
        <p></p>"Like I've told you, I really don't mind making food for you, Fujimiya." Mahiru smiled
        <p></p>very slightly. Somehow, the little grin made Amane feel awkward. It called to mind the
        <p></p>events of the previous day, and Amane couldn't help but avert his eyes from the
        <p></p>beautiful angel in his apartment.
        <p></p>"…All right, thanks," he replied curtly.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 10: Mother Invades 
        <p></p>Asking Mahiru to pick up her portion of the fruit as soon as the package arrived turned
        <p></p>out to be a big mistake. When Amane heard the sound of the intercom and the highpitched, mischievous voice that called "Aaa-maaa-neee!" through it, he understood
        <p></p>that he was in trouble.
        <p></p>Amane had been very grateful for Mahiru's proposal to make lunch for him on Saturday.
        <p></p>It had seemed a veritable blessing from heaven at the time. Truly, the carbonara she'd
        <p></p>whipped up had been delicious. The thick-bodied sauce and the kick of black pepper
        <p></p>were a perfect match, and it'd been tremendously tasty.
        <p></p>Mahiru hadn't done anything wrong. Those at fault were Amane himself for failing to
        <p></p>recognize in advance what his mother had meant by telling him to be home on
        <p></p>Saturday for the delivery and that irksome, surprise-loving woman herself.
        <p></p>"…Um, Fujimiya? Is that the delivery…?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"Nope. That would be my mother. She's probably using her duplicate key to get
        <p></p>through the front door and is heading up right now," Amane explained. Thinking back
        <p></p>on it, it had been his own mistake to take what his mother had said at face value. One
        <p></p>way or another, she always created situations that allowed her to come by and check
        <p></p>in on him. Amane's mother could never resist employing a little misdirection.
        <p></p>"…Uh, your mother?"
        <p></p>"She probably came to see whether I'm getting along okay… and she didn't tell me she
        <p></p>was coming. Probably because she knew I would clean up in advance."
        <p></p>"Uh-huh…"
        <p></p>"I know it's all a bit hard to swallow, but that doesn't matter right now."
        <p></p>Right now, the problem was what to do with Mahiru. If Amane's mother had still been
        <p></p>in the lobby downstairs, he could have sent Mahiru home, but that was out of the
        <p></p>question now that she was approaching his door. At the same time, his mother was
        <p></p>sure to get the wrong idea if he invited her into his apartment and she came across
        <p></p>Mahiru. There was no doubting that Mahiru would hate that as much as Amane would.
        <p></p>The longer Amane puzzled over what to do, the closer his mother was getting to just
        <p></p>barging right in.
        <p></p>I can't believe this is happening… Amane did have an idea, but he didn't like it.
        <p></p>"…I'm sorry, Shiina, but could you please hide in my bedroom?"
        <p></p>"Huh, wh-what?"
        <p></p>"Take your stuff with you, and once I find some way to get my mom outside, you can
        <p></p>go back home. I'm really sorry, but please?"
        <p></p>With no other viable option, Amane took the helm and steered Mahiru into concealing
        <p></p>herself. Thankfully, they'd already finished cleaning up after lunch, so that wouldn't
        <p></p>be a giveaway. If he hid her shoes in the shoe closet, they wouldn't be discovered, and
        <p></p>Mahiru could just bring her personal effects into Amane's room.
        <p></p>The plan was to let Amane's mom to make a quick inspection of the apartment while
        <p></p>Mahiru was hiding. Amane would mention to his mother that he really wanted to eat
        <p></p>her home cooking, something that'd probably keep her too busy to push her way into
        <p></p>his room.
        <p></p>Whatever it took, Amane had to keep his mother from breaching the bedroom.
        <p></p>He would purposely request that his mother cook something that used an ingredient
        <p></p>he didn't have in his refrigerator. If the two of them went out shopping together, that
        <p></p>would provide Mahiru with a window to escape.
        <p></p>Amane hurriedly explained to Mahiru that such a scheme was the only option as he
        <p></p>handed her his extra key and asked her to cooperate with the greatest sincerity he
        <p></p>could muster.
        <p></p>"O-okay," she said, nodding in bewilderment.
        <p></p>In truth, the storage room was also an option, but Amane didn't want a girl to wait in
        <p></p>there. It had no heating, which meant it was quite cold this time of year. Amane's
        <p></p>bedroom had a proper heater, as well as soft cushions. It wouldn't do to have Mahiru
        <p></p>sitting on a bare floor while she shivered from the cold.
        <p></p>"…All right, I'm counting on you. I have to deal with my mom, so…"
        <p></p>Even before meeting his mother, Amane looked dejected. He headed for the entrance
        <p></p>while Mahiru quietly slipped into the bedroom. After making sure that the angel was
        <p></p>hidden, Amane reluctantly opened the front door.
        <p></p>"My goodness Amane, that took you long enough. I'm glad to see you're looking well. I
        <p></p>was starting to wonder if you were asleep."
        <p></p>There was Amane's mother, standing just outside his apartment. He hadn't seen her
        <p></p>since summer break.
        <p></p>Although she was a parent, it would have been difficult to tell from her looks alone. It
        <p></p>wasn't just that her face looked young, she never acted her age, either. She wore the
        <p></p>same sort of happy expression she often had back when Amane was still living at home.
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah, I'm perfectly fine, so how about heading home?"
        <p></p>"How can you say that to your own mother? It took me several hours to get here, you
        <p></p>know? Don't I even get a thank-you?"
        <p></p>"Thank you very much for traveling a great distance, now please go home."
        <p></p>"Come now, don't say such things. It's not very endearing. You should act more like
        <p></p>Shuuto, your father!"
        <p></p>"Men don't need to be endearing, do we?" While Amane had spat his words acidly, his
        <p></p>mother, Shihoko, didn't seem bothered at all, instead breaking into a fit of laughter.
        <p></p>"You've really hit your rebellious phase!" she said. "I hope you're not planning on
        <p></p>having me stand outside all day. I'm coming in, okay?"
        <p></p>"Wait, nobody said you could—"
        <p></p>"Have you forgotten that your father and I pay the rent on this place?"
        <p></p>There was nothing Amane could do to argue or refuse his mother once she'd played
        <p></p>that card. Reluctantly, he allowed her to enter.
        <p></p>To keep her from going into the bedroom, Amane casually guided his mother to walk
        <p></p>past the bedroom door and into the living room.
        <p></p>"By the way, you really should tell me beforehand when you plan on visiting," said
        <p></p>Amane.
        <p></p>"Now, I wouldn't be able to get a proper picture of my son's living situation if I didn't
        <p></p>show up unannounced, would I?" Shihoko replied.
        <p></p>"Ugh… Look, there's no problem, okay? I'm keeping the place clean."
        <p></p>"You certainly are; I'm surprised. You never kept your room clean at home, but you're
        <p></p>doing better than I'd expected. I'm surprised." Shihoko nodded seriously, looking
        <p></p>genuinely astonished as she surveyed the living room.
        <p></p>The unspoken truth was that his place was only clean because Mahiru had helped
        <p></p>Amane tidy up. Her advice and constant scolding was a big part of how his place had
        <p></p>managed to stay clean, too. Really, Mahiru deserved most of the credit, but there was
        <p></p>no way Amane was going to tell his mother that now.
        <p></p>"Your skin looks good, too; you must be eating well," Shihoko observed.
        <p></p>"…Yeah," Amane admitted, unable to meet his mother's eyes. Even his improved health
        <p></p>was something he owed to the angel.
        <p></p>"You're even cooking properly, huh. Oh, but it looks like you're cooking for two?"
        <p></p>Shihoko's manicured finger was pointing at his dish rack. Two people had eaten lunch,
        <p></p>so naturally there were two sets of dishes. Carelessly, Amane had forgotten to put
        <p></p>them away. He should've remembered how perceptive his mother could be.
        <p></p>"Yeah, I had a friend over." Amane's answer was not quite a lie. He'd spoken as
        <p></p>indifferently as he was able, doing his best to stop himself from shaking. It was fair to
        <p></p>say that he and Mahiru had built up to something resembling a friendship, so it wasn't
        <p></p>exactly untrue. There was the small matter of hiding that the friend in question was a
        <p></p>girl.
        <p></p>"Hmm," Shihoko replied with a tone that suggested she didn't really accept that
        <p></p>explanation at face value. She scanned the living room again.
        <p></p>"I suppose you get a passing mark. You're doing so well, I can hardly believe you're a
        <p></p>boy living on his own," Amane's mother finally conceded.
        <p></p>Somehow, Amane had been able to deceive her, though only just barely. Strangely, he
        <p></p>felt a chill run down his spine, and he was sweating bullets. On the other hand, maybe
        <p></p>he shouldn't have been so surprised to have passed his mother's inspection. Mahiru
        <p></p>really had turned some things around for him, after all.
        <p></p>"See, there was nothing for you to worry about, Mom."
        <p></p>"I suppose not; though I can hardly believe it. You could barely do anything for yourself
        <p></p>at home. You've certainly grown up."
        <p></p>"…I'm basically an adult," Amane replied, though inwardly, he scoffed at himself for
        <p></p>having the audacity to say such a thing.
        <p></p>"Good job," Shihoko praised, smiling.
        <p></p>It made Amane a little uncomfortable to hear that, since of course he hadn't done any
        <p></p>of it on his own. There was no way he could risk telling his mother the truth, however,
        <p></p>so he would have to leave things as they were and try to get her out of there.
        <p></p>She's pretty much finished her evaluation, right? I wonder if I can get her to leave
        <p></p>without saying anything about wanting to eat her cooking or whatever, Amane thought.
        <p></p>"That just leaves the bedroom check, I suppose," Shihoko mused nonchalantly.
        <p></p>Amane's eyes went wide at the drop of that bomb. Mahiru was still in there. If his
        <p></p>mother found a girl hiding in the bedroom, a far greater disaster would ensue than if
        <p></p>Amane had just revealed Mahiru from the get-go.
        <p></p>"Hey, don't joke around. Even if you're my mom, I don't want you digging around in my
        <p></p>bedroom."
        <p></p>"Oh? Something in there you're feeling embarrassed about?" Shihoko prodded.
        <p></p>"There's probably one or two embarrassing things in any high school guy's room, if
        <p></p>you think about it."
        <p></p>"So you admit it?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, I admit it. Please don't go in there."
        <p></p>Even though it was shameful, there'd been no other choice. Amane had been forced to
        <p></p>go along with his mother's assumption to keep her from entering the bedroom. If she
        <p></p>discovered Mahiru in Amane's room, she would most assuredly get the wrong idea.
        <p></p>For both his own sake and Mahiru's, Amane needed to avoid that at all costs.
        <p></p>When Amane's mother saw him blocking the door to his room, desperately trying to
        <p></p>keep her from getting through, she could tell right away that he was hiding something.
        <p></p>Closing in on her son, Shihoko said, "I suppose you are grown up, if you're hiding those
        <p></p>sorts of things from your parents."
        <p></p>If it came down to it, Amane was prepared to keep his mom out by force if necessary,
        <p></p>though he admittedly didn't like that idea. He stood ready to stop her, but then…
        <p></p>Thump. There came a noise from inside the bedroom.
        <p></p>"Amane…"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>"What are you hiding?"
        <p></p>"…It has nothing to do with you, Mom."
        <p></p>"So you say." A wide grin spread across Shihoko's face.
        <p></p>It was the kind of coercive smile that could not be denied. Amane became extremely
        <p></p>uncomfortable every time she looked at him like this. It had a way of sapping his
        <p></p>willpower to oppose her.
        <p></p>Amane groaned, and Shihoko saw an opening. She put her hand on the doorknob to
        <p></p>his room, and by the time Amane noticed, it was far too late. Shihoko slipped past
        <p></p>Amane, intent on discovering the source of the noise on the other side of the door.
        <p></p>What met her eyes beyond that barrier that Amane had failed to protect was the figure
        <p></p>of a beautiful girl. She was leaning her back against the side of the bed while hugging
        <p></p>a cushion to her chest. The girl's eyes were closed, and her breaths were a gentle
        <p></p>rhythm. Mahiru had dozed off by the time Shihoko discovered her.
        <p></p>A warm room with a heater running and a full stomach after lunch were the perfect
        <p></p>conditions for an afternoon nap. Amane couldn't help but wonder whether Mahiru
        <p></p>often slept in boys' rooms, but all this really confirmed was that she found Amane to
        <p></p>be harmless enough to doze off in his bedroom.
        <p></p>He couldn't exactly blame her for it. Sitting motionless so as not to make any noise had
        <p></p>probably gotten real boring real fast.
        <p></p>The main problem was, obviously, Shihoko, who had arrived at just the wrong moment
        <p></p>to witness a situation she was sure to misunderstand.
        <p></p>Had he been the third party, Amane would have gotten the wrong idea, too. He would
        <p></p>have assumed they were so intimate that Mahiru had no problem drifting off for a nap
        <p></p>in his room.
        <p></p>Grimacing all the while, Amane glanced over at his mother and saw that her eyes were
        <p></p>sparkling. He could only imagine the commotion she was about to raise.
        <p></p>"Oh my, Amane, you've got such an adorable girlfriend!" Shihoko shrieked in her
        <p></p>youthful voice. "This isn't the kind of girl you can just hide away in a corner, you know!"
        <p></p>Amane felt a headache coming on.
        <p></p>She had immediately jumped to possibly the worst conclusion available, and to make
        <p></p>matters worse, she was clearly very excited about the idea that her son was dating
        <p></p>such a lovely girl. There was no doubt that even Amane's mother was smitten with
        <p></p>Mahiru's beauty.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked so vulnerable when she was asleep. The practiced air of elegant
        <p></p>refinement that she always wore like a mask had melted away, revealing the full
        <p></p>captivating nature of her looks. Her cute face had never looked more peaceful—or
        <p></p>more pretty.
        <p></p>Amane had grown somewhat accustomed to Mahiru's appearance, but seeing her like
        <p></p>this, he was once again struck by her incredible charm. Her cherubic face held such an
        <p></p>innocent serenity. Once again, he felt the urge to reach out and touch her. Her sleeping
        <p></p>figure, hugging Amane's cushion tight, awakened many desires in him that were best
        <p></p>kept private.
        <p></p>This truly captivating girl was Amane's girlfriend, or so his mother thought. It was no
        <p></p>wonder she was excited.
        <p></p>"I suppose the reason you didn't want your mother looking in this room is because
        <p></p>your girlfriend is here? Look at you, growing up right before my eyes."
        <p></p>"That's not it! You've got it all wrong! She's not my girlfriend or anything!"
        <p></p>"Come now, you don't have to make excuses! Your mother has no intention of opposing
        <p></p>your relationship, Amane."
        <p></p>"No, I'm telling you, that's not the issue here! We're not in a romantic relationship!
        <p></p>You've got it totally wrong!"
        <p></p>"Well, whether I'm right or wrong, she's in your bedroom right now, isn't she?"
        <p></p>"That's because you showed up all of the sudden! We were just hanging out in the
        <p></p>living room, but I knew you would misunderstand!"
        <p></p>"You see, the problem with that excuse is that you would never let a girl you don't like
        <p></p>into your apartment. And I really don't think a girl would just waltz right on into the
        <p></p>apartment of someone she didn't like, would she?"
        <p></p>Amane struggled to find a way to argue the issue. His mother was right; Amane was
        <p></p>awfully territorial about his living spaces and wasn't inclined to let just anyone into
        <p></p>his domain.
        <p></p>The first time Mahiru had come in, she'd practically forced her way, but ever since
        <p></p>then, he'd welcomed her over, even when she wasn't coming to cook for him.
        <p></p>I guess that means I really do like her.
        <p></p>As far as Amane was concerned, he was sure he liked Mahiru for her personality, not
        <p></p>her appearance. He enjoyed that seemingly contradictory part to her. There was a
        <p></p>biting and honest side of her that she didn't show at school, and yet she found it hard
        <p></p>to be open about her feelings. He liked her curt and annoyingly helpful attitude and
        <p></p>the reserved way she conducted herself. When she was taken by surprise, she would
        <p></p>get flustered, and the mask would drop momentarily, which was another thing he
        <p></p>enjoyed. Most of all, Amane especially liked that rare angelic smile that he'd only seen
        <p></p>cross her face a few times. He supposed that each of those attributes were all precious
        <p></p>parts of Mahiru's appeal.
        <p></p>If he had to say whether that was a feeling of romantic love, Amane would have
        <p></p>insisted that it was something else, but he couldn't deny that Mahiru was a wonderful
        <p></p>girl for many reasons.
        <p></p>"I care about her as a friend. Not every relationship between members of the opposite
        <p></p>sex has to be romantic, you know. And I'm pretty sure she doesn't feel that way, either."
        <p></p>Amane was not the kind of mama's boy who would obediently play along with
        <p></p>whatever Shihoko said. Plus, Mahiru would certainly object to the suggestion that she
        <p></p>had feelings for him.
        <p></p>"Now, you don't know that, Amane! Aren't you being rather presumptuous, thinking
        <p></p>you know exactly what her heart wants?"
        <p></p>"What can I say to get you to understand that our relationship is not like that, Mom…?
        <p></p>Shiina, please, help me out here…"
        <p></p>No matter how he tried to explain, Amane's mother had already made up her mind.
        <p></p>Amane pressed a finger to his forehead, stumped on what to do. With all possible
        <p></p>urgency, he wished Mahiru would just wake up.
        <p></p>"Nn…"
        <p></p>Either Amane's unspoken prayer had been heard or all the ruckus had, because
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyelids fluttered open, and she made a sweet noise as she raised her face.
        <p></p>Her flaxen hair slipped over her shoulders. The girl's shining eyes, the color of caramel,
        <p></p>were blurry with sleep, and she looked so vulnerable that it felt somehow wrong to
        <p></p>look directly at her.
        <p></p>Maybe she wasn't quite fully awake yet as she looked up at Amane vacantly, her eyes
        <p></p>still relaxed and drowsy. Amane pointedly stared in another direction.
        <p></p>"Shiina, I don't mind that you fell asleep, but there's been a misunderstanding, so
        <p></p>please help me clear things up."
        <p></p>"Misunderstanding…?"
        <p></p>"Hey, hey, Miss Girlfriend, what's your name?"
        <p></p>Mahiru was still clearly confused over what had happened, but Shihoko didn't hesitate
        <p></p>to approach her, beaming with an amiable, carefree smile and an overly familiar
        <p></p>demeanor.
        <p></p>Mahiru was visibly flustered, still trying to get her bearings.
        <p></p>"Huh, uh, um…"
        <p></p>"It's important to tell each other our names when we first meet, you know!"
        <p></p>"Ah, I-I'm Mahiru Shiina…"
        <p></p>"Oh, Mahiru, what a cute name that is! I am Shihoko; please don't be shy and call me
        <p></p>by my first name, okay?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had reflexively given her name when pressed for it. She looked up at Amane,
        <p></p>her eyes begging him for rescue. Unfortunately, Amane was helpless. He had been
        <p></p>hoping Mahiru would save him somehow. Regretfully, he shook his head. He knew that
        <p></p>once his mother got started, there was really no stopping her. She was set on learning
        <p></p>more about Mahiru, and nothing would dissuade her now. It was unlikely she'd ever
        <p></p>realize just how uncomfortable she was making the poor girl.
        <p></p>"A-all right, um… Mrs., that is, uh, Shihoko…"
        <p></p>"See? That sounds more like my daughter-in-law."
        <p></p>"Fujimiya!"
        <p></p>"That could be referring to either of us, you know? Right, Amane?
        <p></p>"Mom, you're bothering Shiina."
        <p></p>"Amane, you mustn't be so formal with your sweet new girlfriend; call her by her first
        <p></p>name!"
        <p></p>Shihoko didn't seem inclined to listen to anything anyone said. Amane scowled at her,
        <p></p>but she didn't show any sign of letting up. Her smile was wide and utterly shameless.
        <p></p>"Uh, um, Shihoko?"
        <p></p>"Yes, dear?"
        <p></p>"He and I—"
        <p></p>"Why, I don't know who you mean. He who?"
        <p></p>"…A-Amane and I; we aren't dating."
        <p></p>Even though she was obviously flustered by his mother's verbal assault, Mahiru tried
        <p></p>her best to set the record straight. Unfortunately, she'd looked right at Amane and had
        <p></p>even been forced to call him by his first name, which was apparently exactly what
        <p></p>Shihoko had been after. The older woman's smile grew even wider.
        <p></p>"Well, I suppose it takes time for things like this to blossom. Something to look forward
        <p></p>to," Shihoko said, quite presumptuously.
        <p></p>"Eh, ah, um, that's not…," Mahiru said, trying to object.
        <p></p>"Oh no, I must have intruded just when things were getting good!"
        <p></p>"U-um, I want you to let me explain properly! I don't have that kind of relationship
        <p></p>with… Amane. We were just having lunch together because Amane can't cook!"
        <p></p>"What a wonderful bride you'll make, sweetie. My Amane set out to live on his own
        <p></p>even though he's incapable of doing any kind of housework, you see. So I really do
        <p></p>appreciate you supporting him."
        <p></p>"No, uh—"
        <p></p>Mahiru had put up a heroic effort, but she may as well have been banging her head
        <p></p>against a wall at this point. The moment she'd mentioned visiting Amane's place,
        <p></p>cooking there, and sitting at the same table as him, the sparkle in Shihoko's eyes had
        <p></p>changed. The pushy mother somehow looked even more unhinged than usual to
        <p></p>Amane.
        <p></p>Once Shihoko got like this, he knew there was nothing he could do to stop her. The
        <p></p>only person who ever stood a chance was his father, Shuuto.
        <p></p>"Shiina, just give up. My mother won't listen to anyone when she gets like this."
        <p></p>"You can't be serious…" Mahiru sounded extremely dismayed.
        <p></p>Amane realized that they weren't getting anywhere. Trying to explain the situation
        <p></p>wasn't working, and he clearly couldn't stop his mother's wild speculations.
        <p></p>"At any rate, my Amane did quite well to snag such a beauty. I'm surprised."
        <p></p>With Amane exhausted from arguing, and Mahiru having no clear idea what to do,
        <p></p>both simply went quiet.
        <p></p>It was possible Amane's mother took their sudden silence as a sign of agreement,
        <p></p>though Shihoko had doubtlessly already assumed that their embarrassment was proof
        <p></p>enough of her suspicions. She was looking at Mahiru with no attempt to hide the wild
        <p></p>curiosity in her eyes.
        <p></p>"What do you think, Mahiru? Can my Amane really make it, living on his own?"
        <p></p>"Uh… That's… Well…," Mahiru stammered. "…Enough to stay alive…"
        <p></p>"You should've just said I'll be fine!" Amane interjected.
        <p></p>"I remember the place being pretty bad," Mahiru reminded him.
        <p></p>"Don't bring that up. I'm keeping it clean now, aren't I?"
        <p></p>"And I've been helping you with the cleaning this whole time, haven't I?"
        <p></p>"That's true, and I'm grateful for it," Amane admitted. "All of it, truly—the food, the
        <p></p>cleaning, and everything else." Mahiru was inarguably the reason that he'd been able
        <p></p>to live so comfortably, and he would bow down in thanks to her without any hesitation.
        <p></p>He knew that she wouldn't have done so much if she'd hated it, but he always strove
        <p></p>to make his appreciate known.
        <p></p>As should've been expected by now, Amane's mother interpreted the exchange in a
        <p></p>different light.
        <p></p>"Well now, Amane, so it wasn't just today's lunch! Mahiru's been doing everything for
        <p></p>you this whole time, you useless child. The way you speak to each other—it's like
        <p></p>you're already living together!"
        <p></p>"No! How did you even reach that conclusion?! We only live next to each other!" Amane
        <p></p>fired back.
        <p></p>"Aha, so it was fate! Isn't that wonderful, Amane. You got me such a beautiful daughterin-law."
        <p></p>"I'm not denying that she's beautiful and talented, but I'm totally against calling it fate
        <p></p>or destiny or whatever!"
        <p></p>"Doesn't it sound more romantic that way?"
        <p></p>"That's not what I'm bothered by! I'm telling you we don't have a romantic relationship
        <p></p>at all!"
        <p></p>"How persistent." Clearly, Shihoko was choosing to believe that Amane was still too
        <p></p>embarrassed to admit the truth.
        <p></p>Amane's face contorted into a progressively deeper grimace, and he heaved his
        <p></p>heaviest sigh of the last few months. He couldn't recall how many times he'd suffered
        <p></p>at the hands of his mother's wild imagination. Shihoko was really the kind of woman
        <p></p>who just did whatever she wanted.
        <p></p>As for Mahiru, the one who'd been caught unawares by the full weight of Shihoko's
        <p></p>overwhelming enthusiasm, she could do little else than look helplessly back and forth
        <p></p>between Amane and his mother, utterly bewildered.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, this is probably a parent's love talking, but my Amane isn't very good with
        <p></p>words, and he isn't very up-front about his feelings, but he is faithful and gentlemanly.
        <p></p>I'd say he's a pretty good catch. Plus, he doesn't have any experience with girls, so
        <p></p>you'll be able to get him to do whatever you want."
        <p></p>"What on earth are you saying, Mom? Seriously, cut it out."
        <p></p>That last bit especially is none of her business, Amane thought angrily.
        <p></p>"I mean, it's true, isn't it? If not, then why haven't you had any other girlfriends? You
        <p></p>resemble your father, so I don't think it's your looks. Maybe it's because you're a little
        <p></p>immature?"
        <p></p>"It's n-none of your business."
        <p></p>"You really should try harder to act cool in front of Mahiru, you know."
        <p></p>"I will not, and she's not interested, either," Amane protested.
        <p></p>"Oh, come now! Sweetie, you can train him to suit your own preferences, you know.
        <p></p>Amane cleans up pretty good if you dress him up."
        <p></p>Shihoko, grinning madly, struck poor Mahiru again, who could do nothing but offer a
        <p></p>vague sort of smile in return. Not even an angel could retaliate in a battle like this.
        <p></p>Amane's mother was truly something else.
        <p></p>"Mom, you're bothering her. Please go home."
        <p></p>"What a big man you've become, telling your mother to go home."
        <p></p>"I'm serious, please. It's really obvious that you're making her uncomfortable."
        <p></p>"Oh? Is that true, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Don't ask her; she'll definitely just say what you want to hear. Just this once, please
        <p></p>head back. You can come back some other time."
        <p></p>"Well, if you're going that far, I suppose I get the message. I did barge in while you were
        <p></p>alone with your girlfriend, after all. It's only natural you'd be upset to lose your alone
        <p></p>time."
        <p></p>"Fine, you can explain it however you like. Just hurry up and go!"
        <p></p>Amane was beyond tired of arguing with his mother, and this whole situation had to
        <p></p>be taking a toll on Mahiru as well. He looked over and saw that she also looked
        <p></p>exhausted.
        <p></p>Vowing internally to shower her with appreciation later, Amane shooed his mother
        <p></p>away and got a look of sour disapproval in return. Even so, Shihoko didn't make an
        <p></p>effort to stay, so at least she kind of cared, though it was obvious her view of reality
        <p></p>was still quite different.
        <p></p>"Ah, Mahiru, let's exchange contact information, shall we? I want a full report later on
        <p></p>how Amane's doing, among other things."
        <p></p>"Uh, o-okay…?"
        <p></p>In a last-ditch effort, Shihoko tried to sink her hooks in again. Caught in the woman's
        <p></p>powerful momentum, Mahiru wound up exchanging contact information with her.
        <p></p>Now Amane's mother would be able to reach her directly. The thought made Amane
        <p></p>want to press a hand to his forehead.
        <p></p>Beaming wide, Shihoko gripped Mahiru's hand and reminded the girl to look after her
        <p></p>son. Amane resolved to send his father a message later, asking him to rein Shihoko in.
        <p></p>"I'm exhausted…"
        <p></p>"Sorry; she's like a hurricane."
        <p></p>Shihoko hadn't stayed all that long, but she'd left the two completely ragged.
        <p></p>After flumping down on the couch, Amane put his head in his hands and sighed deeply.
        <p></p>Mahiru gingerly took a seat, too, but her usually perfect posture was bent and haggard.
        <p></p>Amane had thought that the angel could handle anyone, but even she had no energy
        <p></p>left after the encounter with his mother. He was unsure if he should try to apologize.
        <p></p>"I really didn't want to let her go home still believing the wrong thing," Amane admitted.
        <p></p>"Well, there's no real harm done…," Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"No, I think there is… If she was acting like that, it probably means that she's taken a
        <p></p>liking to you… One way or another, she's gonna be an issue…"
        <p></p>It was truly unfortunate that this was going to put a burden on Mahiru. Shihoko's love
        <p></p>for all things adorable, coupled with her mistaking Mahiru for her son's girlfriend,
        <p></p>almost certainly meant that Amane's mother would be finding new ways to poke her
        <p></p>nose where it didn't belong in the days to come. Trouble was on the horizon.
        <p></p>"Shihoko really cares about you a lot, doesn't she?"
        <p></p>"That's a nice way to put it, but sometimes she really just refuses to listen…"
        <p></p>More than just an overly affectionate parent, Shihoko doted and fawned on Amane
        <p></p>even though he hated it. He knew he shouldn't complain too much, since it was
        <p></p>probably at least partly his own fault because he was such hopeless slob. It wasn't as
        <p></p>though he was ungrateful for all his mother had provided, but she could be a real pain
        <p></p>in the butt, and he wished she'd give him more space.
        <p></p>"…How nice," Mahiru mumbled quietly.
        <p></p>Amane looked up at her. "What is?"
        <p></p>"Your mother is quite a character but also very kind."
        <p></p>"That means she's loud and loves to meddle."
        <p></p>"…Even so, I think it's nice."
        <p></p>Mahiru's words weren't an empty compliment; she really did seem envious as she
        <p></p>mumbled and averted her eyes.
        <p></p>A gloomy expression was plain on the girl's face. So much so that Amane thought she
        <p></p>might break down into tears at the drop of a hat. Anyone could have sensed how fragile
        <p></p>she was right now. It was clearly more than simple exhaustion.
        <p></p>Mahiru must have noticed Amane looking at her, because she suddenly looked up and
        <p></p>forced her lips into a small smile. Then, just as quickly, she regained her usual
        <p></p>composure and leaned back against the sofa, something she rarely did.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, huh?"
        <p></p>"…What are you saying all of a sudden?"
        <p></p>"Nothing… I was just thinking that it's been a while since anyone called me by my first
        <p></p>name. Most people only address me by my family name."
        <p></p>It was pretty surprising to know that someone who seemed as popular as Mahiru
        <p></p>didn't actually have any friends close enough to call her by her first name. Everyone at
        <p></p>school saw her as a flawless angel. Even Mahiru's acquaintances probably maintained
        <p></p>some degree of formality with her, and nobody had the courage to really get to know
        <p></p>her. A lot of students only ever addressed her by a nickname that Mahiru herself didn't
        <p></p>even like.
        <p></p>"Well, I guess if you don't have any close friends, that would leave only your parents,
        <p></p>right?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"My parents would never talk to me that way. Absolutely not." Mahiru's reply was cold.
        <p></p>Looking her over, Amane saw that Mahiru's face was an expressionless mask. She
        <p></p>resembled a beautiful doll, completely devoid of feeling. That, too, only lasted a
        <p></p>second, however, and Mahiru's visage changed again when she noticed that Amane
        <p></p>was looking at her. Her eyebrows lowered, as if she was troubled by something.
        <p></p>"…Anyway, it doesn't happen often," she muttered, before letting out a sigh.
        <p></p>Amane had been wondering for a while if Mahiru had a bad relationship with her
        <p></p>parents. It had been easy enough to imagine that she had problems at home from her
        <p></p>frosty demeanor whenever he touched on the subject. Plus, she never went out to eat
        <p></p>with her parents and hated her own birthdays, but Amane never would've thought
        <p></p>Mahiru's parents were so distant as to not even call the girl by her first name.
        <p></p>Thinking back to how Mahiru had quietly said she enjoyed Shihoko's personality,
        <p></p>Amane wondered how the angel must have felt in that moment.
        <p></p>"Mahiru." Rather suddenly, Amane blurted out the word. He'd never called his
        <p></p>neighbor by her first name before. The girl in question blinked her caramel eyes. She
        <p></p>looked stunned, and Amane could tell that he'd caught her off guard. The momentary
        <p></p>surprise had revealed a youthfulness about Mahiru that she normally kept hidden.
        <p></p>"It's your name. Someone ought to call you by it," Amane reasoned.
        <p></p>"…I suppose you're right," Mahiru answered bluntly. A few moments later, a tiny smile
        <p></p>appeared. Amane's chest felt fluttery when he spotted it.
        <p></p>"…Amane."
        <p></p>When he heard her small voice pronounce his own first name, the flutter turned to a
        <p></p>storm. Maybe it was because, until just a moment ago, his mom was the one calling
        <p></p>him by his first name, but when Mahiru called him by his first name face-to-face, he
        <p></p>felt the uneasy, impatient stirring in his chest churn and roar.
        <p></p>"Please don't call me that outside, okay?" Mahiru reminded.
        <p></p>"…I already wasn't planning to. That goes for you, too. Don't slip up outside the
        <p></p>apartment."
        <p></p>"Understood. It's our secret, right?"
        <p></p>Amane couldn't bring himself to look directly at Mahiru, as she was still grinning a
        <p></p>little. Looking away, he responded in agreement and shifted in his seat, turning away
        <p></p>to escape the angel's smile.
        <p></p>Though Shihoko's Saturday invasion had been a nightmare, nothing much had
        <p></p>changed aside from how Amane and Mahiru referred to each other.
        <p></p>They hadn't suddenly become any closer. Addressing each other a little more directly
        <p></p>wasn't a big deal. At most, perhaps Mahiru's demeanor had softened a little, but that
        <p></p>was it.
        <p></p>"…Um, Amane?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had come over earlier than usual for dinner on Sunday, perhaps feeling a little
        <p></p>uneasy, because she looked troubled.
        <p></p>Amane was glad to let her in, but he was confused by her peculiar attitude. He'd
        <p></p>thought that maybe using their first names didn't sit right with her after all, but when
        <p></p>the time had come, she'd said his name without hesitation, so there must have been
        <p></p>something else bothering her.
        <p></p>For the time being, they sat on the sofa together, and as he waited to see what Mahiru
        <p></p>would do, she pulled a handkerchief from her skirt pocket.
        <p></p>As Amane continued to wonder what was up, Mahiru opened the neatly folded
        <p></p>handkerchief to reveal a tarnished silver key. It must have been the one he'd given her
        <p></p>the day before.
        <p></p>"I'm returning your spare key. In the end, I never got the chance to use it, and then I
        <p></p>forgot to give it back. I'm very sorry about that."
        <p></p>"I see."
        <p></p>Apparently, Mahiru hadn't been able to rest until she'd returned the key. Satisfied that
        <p></p>he understood the cause for her strange behavior, Amane stared at the bit of metal
        <p></p>resting on the handkerchief.
        <p></p>Now that he thought about it, Mahiru came over to fix dinner in his apartment almost
        <p></p>every night. Usually, he met her at the door, but sometimes it took him a while. There'd
        <p></p>even been times where Mahiru had been forced to wait because he wasn't home. It
        <p></p>must have been inconvenient for her to have to wait outside for him, especially during
        <p></p>these colder months. Somewhere, Amane had heard that chilly weather was a girl's
        <p></p>worst enemy, and now that he thought about it, he wouldn't have been too happy
        <p></p>waiting in the cold, either, had the situation been reversed.
        <p></p>Since Mahiru was basically coming over every day, he wondered if it wouldn't be easier
        <p></p>for her to have a key to get in.
        <p></p>"That's fine; I think you should keep it," he said.
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"You can give it back to me whenever we stop spending time together."
        <p></p>It seemed perfectly reasonable to Amane. Now that Mahiru had the key, she might as
        <p></p>well keep it—but she didn't seem convinced.
        <p></p>"B-but…"
        <p></p>"I mean, going to the door every time you come over is a hassle."
        <p></p>"Ah, so that's what this is about."
        <p></p>"I doubt you're going to misuse it or anything."
        <p></p>"Well, that's true, but…"
        <p></p>Amane had been sharing meals with Mahiru for more than a month now, and he
        <p></p>figured that he knew her pretty well. She was sensible, considerate, and kind. He was
        <p></p>certain that she would never hand the key over to anyone else or do anything while
        <p></p>Amane wasn't around. If there was anyone he could trust, it was Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Besides, you must think it's a pain to have to ring the buzzer and wait out there all
        <p></p>the time," Amane said.
        <p></p>"Even if it is, I feel like you're being a bit careless."
        <p></p>"But I'm giving it to you because I trust you."
        <p></p>At that, Mahiru's eyes went wide, and she floundered for words. Confusion, along with
        <p></p>something else that Amane didn't really understand, passed over the girl's delicate
        <p></p>features.
        <p></p>The truth of it was that Amane had only wanted her to have the key to save himself
        <p></p>some trouble, but if she really hated the idea, he was prepared to back down.
        <p></p>As for Mahiru, she looked intently back and forth between Amane and the key for a
        <p></p>few moments, then finally let out a gentle sigh.
        <p></p>"…Understood. I'll hold on to it."
        <p></p>"Mm."
        <p></p>"You know, I'm never sure if something is a big deal to you, or if you even care at all,
        <p></p>Amane," Mahiru jabbed with a slightly prickly tone. She sounded fed up, and Amane
        <p></p>couldn't do anything but smile wryly.
        <p></p>"Suits me well, don't you think?"
        <p></p>"You shouldn't say things like that about yourself," Mahiru admonished.
        <p></p>Amane's smile grew wider. Mahiru seemed to be growing more comfortable with this
        <p></p>kind of silly back-and-forth. They were now on a first-name basis, of course. It
        <p></p>would've been strange if they hadn't built up some kind of rapport. While Mahiru's
        <p></p>eyes were still full of exasperation, as if to say that Amane was really a hopeless case,
        <p></p>her gaze wasn't cold. In fact, there was a noticeable bit of warmth to it. She understood
        <p></p>that Amane was just joking around.
        <p></p>"All right then, I won't hesitate to use this. I might even do something to your
        <p></p>apartment without telling you."
        <p></p>"Like what?"
        <p></p>"…Like… a surprise cleaning!"
        <p></p>"I would be grateful for that."
        <p></p>"…Or how about if your fridge was suddenly packed full of food?"
        <p></p>"It'd make breakfast easier, and we'd have more options for dinner, too."
        <p></p>Mahiru's idea of a prank clearly needed some work. Amane would've been glad to
        <p></p>suffer under any one of her suggestions. That she couldn't come up with a real threat
        <p></p>even when she truly tried only reminded Amane of Mahiru's gentle nature. It was quite
        <p></p>charming and brought a smile to his lips.
        <p></p>"Are you sure you're not making fun of me?" Mahiru looked like she ready to pout,
        <p></p>which would've been cute in its own right, but Amane didn't want to upset Mahiru any
        <p></p>further.
        <p></p>Suppressing the grin that threatened to break out, Amane said, "Course not."
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 11: A Reward for the Angel 
        <p></p>"Well, guess that's how it goes," Amane grumbled as he looked the list of names up and
        <p></p>down. The rankings for the previous week's tests were out, so Amane had shown up
        <p></p>to check them like the rest of his class.
        <p></p>Coming in at twenty-first, Amane was situated around his usual score. It was a good
        <p></p>enough ranking but hardly a result that stood out. He hadn't found this exam any more
        <p></p>challenging than previous ones, though it was still a relief to see he'd done as well as
        <p></p>he'd expected.
        <p></p>Surprising no one, Mahiru reigned over all the rest from her typical first-place
        <p></p>position. She truly was a genius, but Amane knew perfectly well that she didn't attain
        <p></p>that position without applying herself. Amane had often seen her studying after
        <p></p>dinner. He wasn't about to argue that Mahiru wasn't smart, but he felt confident that
        <p></p>it was the hard work that put her at the top more than anything else.
        <p></p>"Shiina is first again, huh?"
        <p></p>"Of course she is. The angel's on a whole different level."
        <p></p>Such proclamations caused Amane to make a sour face.
        <p></p>"…What's with that look? Was your rank that bad?" Itsuki came over, puzzled by his
        <p></p>friend's odd expression.
        <p></p>Only the top fifty test scores had been posted. As such, Itsuki hadn't come to see his
        <p></p>own score, but rather, to accompany Amane.
        <p></p>"It's nothing. I'm twenty-first."
        <p></p>"Oh? Isn't that better than last time?"
        <p></p>"Only by a little. Gotta consider the margin of error."
        <p></p>"Whoa, you clever people even speak differently compared with us common folk."
        <p></p>Itsuki grinned.
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah." Amane ignored his friend's sarcasm and turned back to the class
        <p></p>rankings. He knew Mahiru really gave it her all when it came to studying. She didn't
        <p></p>like all that effort to show, however, so she worked tirelessly in secret to make her
        <p></p>success look like it came naturally. Others might've praised her or called her a genius,
        <p></p>but since they didn't know about all the behind-the-scenes struggling, they couldn't
        <p></p>recognize her actual accomplishments.
        <p></p>That must have been an oppressive way for Mahiru to live.
        <p></p>"…I should at least do something," Amane whispered.
        <p></p>"Hmm? What'd you say?"
        <p></p>"Nothing. Come on, let's go back to class."
        <p></p>"'Kay."
        <p></p>"Huh? What's this, Amane?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had gone to the supermarket and returned with dinner ingredients. When
        <p></p>she'd started to put them in the refrigerator, a conspicuously unfamiliar white box had
        <p></p>caught her eye.
        <p></p>"Hmm? Ah, it's a cake."
        <p></p>It was likely that Mahiru already had an inkling as to the box's contents based on its
        <p></p>shape, but she'd gone ahead and asked anyway. Amane had gone to a patisserie that
        <p></p>Chitose talked about a lot on social media to buy the cake.
        <p></p>"…Do you like cake?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"Not really. I bought it for you."
        <p></p>"What? Why?"
        <p></p>"I thought it would be nice as a little celebration, because you were top of our year on
        <p></p>the test. It's to congratulate you."
        <p></p>Mahiru quickly blinked a few times, unable to process that the cake was for her. She
        <p></p>looked quite taken aback.
        <p></p>"B-but I get top rank every time, so it's not really something to celebrate," she protested.
        <p></p>"Well, you're always working hard, so I thought it might be nice to get a reward for
        <p></p>once. It's a shortcake. I hope you like that."
        <p></p>"Huh? I mean… I don't hate it or anything…"
        <p></p>"Great. Have some after dinner."
        <p></p>While Mahiru still looked a bit troubled, Amane cut the conversation off there. He'd
        <p></p>decided that it would be best to act like this was no big deal, since Mahiru always
        <p></p>seemed troubled when people treated her like she was special.
        <p></p>Mahiru was the type of person who would exhaust herself taking care of someone else
        <p></p>but then neglect herself. Amane had never once seen the girl do anything enjoyable
        <p></p>for her own sake, and whenever anyone praised her or showed appreciation, she'd
        <p></p>just redouble her efforts and run herself down.
        <p></p>Simply put, Mahiru was not good at accepting kindness from others. Amane hadn't
        <p></p>known her for all that long, but he was sure that much was true. That's why he wanted
        <p></p>to return just a little bit of the kindness she was always showing him.
        <p></p>Amane smiled again as Mahiru got everything ready in the kitchen and began cooking
        <p></p>for that night.
        <p></p>After dinner, Mahiru put the cake on a plate and brought it over to the coffee table with
        <p></p>a nervous expression. Amane couldn't help but chuckle at the sight.
        <p></p>"Wh-why are you laughing?"
        <p></p>"Nothing. Don't worry about it."
        <p></p>"It doesn't seem like nothing."
        <p></p>"It's fine—stop worrying."
        <p></p>Amane found it amusing that Mahiru was acting so stiff, but his laughter clearly
        <p></p>bothered her. He was supposed to be showing her some appreciation, not making fun
        <p></p>of her, so Amane quickly shut up.
        <p></p>Mahiru set the cake and the coffee she had brought along with it on the low table, then
        <p></p>sat down on the sofa.
        <p></p>Her movements were still slightly stilted, and Amane felt another fit of laughter
        <p></p>coming on, but Mahiru was sitting next to him now, so he did his best to quash the
        <p></p>temptation.
        <p></p>A shy look in her eyes, Mahiru glanced up at Amane.
        <p></p>"Right, so congratulations," he said.
        <p></p>"…Thank you very much. But…"
        <p></p>"It's fine; just enjoy it. You worked hard."
        <p></p>"That's true, but…"
        <p></p>"Come on, eat up. Even you should treat yourself to something nice once in a while."
        <p></p>The deed was done, and the cake was already here. Mahiru couldn't object to that. She
        <p></p>gave a small nod before picking up the plate of cake and a fork.
        <p></p>"Very well, then I will gratefully accept this," she said.
        <p></p>"Please go ahead."
        <p></p>With a nimble wave, Mahiru cut the cake into bite-size pieces with her fork and
        <p></p>cautiously tried some. Amane imagined that girls were naturally very picky about
        <p></p>their sweets, but since he'd gotten the cake from one of Chitose's favorite shops, he
        <p></p>was fairly confident it was a good choice.
        <p></p>He knew his hunch was correct when he saw Mahiru's eyes widen slightly when she
        <p></p>put the cake in her mouth, then the corners of her mouth relax slightly. Usually,
        <p></p>Mahiru's expressions really didn't change all that much, but recently, she'd become a
        <p></p>bit more animated, or perhaps it was that Amane had gotten better at reading her
        <p></p>emotions.
        <p></p>The mellow, carefree face that Mahiru let show as she slowly savored her cake was
        <p></p>one she made only while eating.
        <p></p>"…Hmm? Is something wrong?" She must have noticed Amane staring, and he quickly
        <p></p>looked away.
        <p></p>"No, nothing," he answered hastily.
        <p></p>Now it was Mahiru's turn to stare at Amane. Suddenly, she snatched up the fork again,
        <p></p>as if an idea had just struck her. She stabbed one bite of cake and held it out toward
        <p></p>Amane in a suggestive way. In other words, she was offering to feed him.
        <p></p>"Oh, um… no, thanks, I didn't really want any," Amane protested.
        <p></p>"Really?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"…No, well, um… if it's all right, I guess I'll have some, but, uh…" Amane certainly hadn't
        <p></p>expected this development. At a loss, he reflexively agreed.
        <p></p>A beautiful girl, hand-feeding him cake. For many adolescent boys, it would be a dream
        <p></p>come true. Unfortunately, Amane's shyness prevented him from enjoying the situation
        <p></p>as much as he would've liked.
        <p></p>"You're the one who bought it in the first place, Amane, so you've got to have some,
        <p></p>too."
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed entirely unaware of any of the implications behind her gesture. She
        <p></p>maintained an ordinary, clueless expression as she held the cake out toward his
        <p></p>mouth.
        <p></p>There was no way he could turn her down, so Amane steeled himself and bit down.
        <p></p>An incredibly sugary flavor instantly hit him.
        <p></p>"…This is crazy sweet," he said.
        <p></p>"Well, it is cake."
        <p></p>That wasn't what Amane had really been getting at, but Mahiru remained oblivious.
        <p></p>Sweetness spread through Amane's mouth as he chewed, but he was too preoccupied
        <p></p>with something else to appreciate the flavor.
        <p></p>"…This really doesn't seem weird to you, does it?" Amane questioned in a low voice.
        <p></p>He was practically gagging on sweetness and shame, and Mahiru was acting like this
        <p></p>was all quite normal. Amane snatched the fork from Mahiru's hand and held out a bite
        <p></p>of cake to her in the same way she'd done for him.
        <p></p>Turnabout is fair play, right?
        <p></p>"…Um." Mahiru hesitated.
        <p></p>"Eat it," Amane insisted, his tone surprisingly forceful. Mahiru looked even more
        <p></p>confused. Perhaps knowing that she'd started this, she decided to play along and
        <p></p>timidly took a quick bite. The action reminded Amane of a small bird nipping at
        <p></p>something.
        <p></p>Amane stared at Mahiru as she chewed, and gradually, a change came over her. At first,
        <p></p>she'd just looked entirely bewildered, but as her mouth moved, a slight redness spread
        <p></p>across Mahiru's face. By the time she swallowed the cake, there was no hiding her
        <p></p>obvious embarrassment. Mahiru's usually milk-white cheeks now resembled apples,
        <p></p>and her eyes were shimmering, slightly blurred with tears.
        <p></p>"So what do you think?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"I-it's d-delicious…"
        <p></p>"Not that. What do you think about being fed?"
        <p></p>Surely Mahiru understood now how Amane had felt earlier, and her eyes shifted down
        <p></p>to look at the floor while she trembled faintly.
        <p></p>"…I feel very much like running away."
        <p></p>"I bet you do. That's exactly the sort of thing that might give people the wrong idea,
        <p></p>you know. Save it for your female friends, okay?" Amane turned away sharply to
        <p></p>emphasize his point.
        <p></p>"Okay," Mahiru replied with a voice that was barely above a whisper.
        <p></p>She'd probably only fed Amane so easily because she trusted him. Mahiru hadn't
        <p></p>meant any harm by it, of course, but it was still troublesome.
        <p></p>A stubborn sweetness still clung to the inside of Amane's mouth.
        <p></p>Guess someone feeling too safe around you can be its own kind of problem.
        <p></p>In the end, Mahiru curled up into a ball next to Amane, looking slightly embarrassed
        <p></p>as she let a small sigh escape.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 12: Cooking Classes with the Angel 
        <p></p>Amane usually bought something to eat for lunch at school, but on days off, that wasn't
        <p></p>possible. He and Mahiru each had their own errands to take care of, so it was
        <p></p>impossible to eat both lunch and dinner together. Even if it had been doable, Amane
        <p></p>would've felt supremely guilty asking Mahiru to make and eat two meals with him.
        <p></p>Usually, Amane only needed to handle his weekend lunches himself, but if he made too
        <p></p>frequent use of the convenience store, Mahiru would scold him, saying something like
        <p></p>"You need to eat a properly balanced diet." With the costs of his dinners piling up,
        <p></p>Amane also felt awkward about going out to eat for lunch.
        <p></p>What to do for his midday meal was quickly becoming an issue.
        <p></p>"…I wonder if I should cook something?"
        <p></p>Without any errands that would take Amane out of the house, he sat at home by
        <p></p>himself. Noon was only an hour away.
        <p></p>Mahiru had likely already gotten started making something for herself, but the same
        <p></p>could not be said for her hapless neighbor.
        <p></p>When it came down to it, Amane could make something if he really had to. It wasn't
        <p></p>like in manga where he'd churn out some censored blob. While it wouldn't look
        <p></p>particularly fantastic and might not taste spectacular, the food Amane was capable of
        <p></p>creating was edible. It wasn't exactly cooking, but it was close enough, and it kept him
        <p></p>fed.
        <p></p>The problem was that he'd grown accustomed to Mahiru's top-rate meals, so the idea
        <p></p>of going back to his own dishes was not particularly appealing. Nobody would want to
        <p></p>go back to such plain fare after sampling such delicious works of art.
        <p></p>…Augh, Mahiru really spoils me.
        <p></p>Amane had become a slave to Mahiru's cooking. He felt ashamed at the thought of
        <p></p>going out to eat again, but he'd also lost interest in convenience-store meals.
        <p></p>Deciding that he'd been depending on Mahiru too much, Amane concluded this was a
        <p></p>good time to challenge himself. Even though he'd failed when it came to preparing his
        <p></p>own meals thus far.
        <p></p>Mahiru wouldn't be with him forever, after all. Things between them were nice and
        <p></p>reliable for now, but there were still two years of high school left, so if anything
        <p></p>happened during that time, this relationship of theirs might come to an abrupt end.
        <p></p>What's more, they would surely go their separate ways when it came time for college.
        <p></p>There was no way things would simply go on like this indefinitely.
        <p></p>I guess I'd better try to put in a little effort now, while I still have her around.
        <p></p>Resolving to do something, even if it was relatively minor, Amane stood up from the
        <p></p>sofa and grabbed his wallet.
        <p></p>"Oh, did you go to the supermarket?"
        <p></p>On his way back from the store, Amane ran into Mahiru in the apartment lobby. He
        <p></p>wasn't sure if the coincidental meeting was good or bad. Mahiru looked like she'd also
        <p></p>just gone out, because she was carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery
        <p></p>store.
        <p></p>"Yeah," Amane admitted. There was no need to hide it, so Amane waved his supermarket
        <p></p>bags to show her.
        <p></p>With a curious expression, Mahiru asked, "Oh, was the shopping from yesterday not
        <p></p>enough? Didn't you buy everything on the list?"
        <p></p>"N-no, that's not it… It's just… I thought I might try making lunch on my own," he said.
        <p></p>"…On your own?"
        <p></p>Despite the explanation, Mahiru's eyes seemed full of doubt. It was only natural.
        <p></p>Before becoming dependent on Mahiru's cooking, Amane had survived by buying
        <p></p>premade meals and convenience-store lunches. It must have been difficult for her to
        <p></p>believe that he was really going to cook for himself.
        <p></p>"I don't want to say anything mean," Mahiru continued, "so I'll just tell you it would be
        <p></p>safer for you to stop now. What if you burn yourself or get a cut?"
        <p></p>"…You know, it's not like I literally can't cook anything at all."
        <p></p>"Right, it's just that you can't cook anything that tastes good. And that's assuming you
        <p></p>don't kill yourself in the process."
        <p></p>Mahiru's thorough dressing down left Amane speechless. She'd said exactly what he
        <p></p>himself had been thinking.
        <p></p>"If you say you're going ahead with it, I won't stop you," Mahiru said, "but manage your
        <p></p>expectations, or you'll end up severely disappointed."
        <p></p>"…Fair enough," Amane conceded.
        <p></p>By "expectations" she must have been referring to her own cooking. Mahiru was
        <p></p>confident in her abilities, and she was well aware how much Amane enjoyed her food.
        <p></p>"It's just that, well, you're always talking about nutrition and stuff. There might be
        <p></p>some time in the future when I really have to live on my own, like college. I can't rely
        <p></p>on you forever, right?"
        <p></p>Overdependence on Mahiru only spelled trouble for Amane. After realizing how much
        <p></p>Mahiru had been spoiling him lately, he felt like he ought to be able to at least manage
        <p></p>the basics.
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes went wide at Amane's words, then she let out a sigh that sounded just
        <p></p>the slightest bit impressed.
        <p></p>"…I think it's a great thing to set your eyes on the future, but if you're going to do that,
        <p></p>shouldn't you have come to me first?" she posed.
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"Rather than making whatever kind of mess you're about to do without my supervision,
        <p></p>it would be much better for me to watch and ensure nothing goes wrong. Amane, are
        <p></p>you confident that you won't accidentally destroy your kitchen?"
        <p></p>"…No." Amane sighed. He knew he made a terrible mess of his kitchen whenever he
        <p></p>tried to use it. With no rebuttal, he gave Mahiru a slow nod.
        <p></p>"It figures," Mahiru replied stolidly. "That's why it's better for me to be there, right?"
        <p></p>"Would that be asking too much?"
        <p></p>"If I didn't want to do it, I wouldn't have suggested the idea." Her voice had a bit of a
        <p></p>cold edge to it, but since she was agreeing to help him, Amane didn't mind. He bowed
        <p></p>deeply to express his gratitude.
        <p></p>"You don't need to be so formal," Mahiru said, sounding flustered. Amane smiled, and
        <p></p>the two stepped into the elevator, taking it up to their floor.
        <p></p>"…By the way, do you have an apron?" Mahiru inquired.
        <p></p>"No problems on that front. I bought one for cooking class."
        <p></p>"And did you use it?"
        <p></p>"There was really no point. All I did was measure ingredients and wash dishes."
        <p></p>"Figures." Mahiru sighed, as if that was exactly what she had suspected. She accompanied
        <p></p>Amane into his apartment. There was actually another apron already there, one that
        <p></p>Mahiru had left behind. Amane would've felt fairly uncomfortable using that one,
        <p></p>however.
        <p></p>Donning the apron she kept at Amane's place, Mahiru gathered her hair up into a
        <p></p>ponytail, like she usually did. Eyes narrowed, she watched Amane put on the darkcolored apron that he had pulled from the back of a dresser drawer.
        <p></p>"Wow, I've never seen you in that before, Amane. It kind of feels like the apron's
        <p></p>wearing you."
        <p></p>"Oh, well, excuuuse me."
        <p></p>"I guess there's nothing we can do about that. So you've already decided what you plan
        <p></p>to make, right? Since you went and bought the ingredients." Mahiru took a peek at the
        <p></p>shopping bag that Amane had set on a shelf.
        <p></p>Amane nodded. "Stir-fried vegetables and an omelet."
        <p></p>"…Veggie stir-fry because I've been scolding you to eat more vegetables and an omelet
        <p></p>because you like eggs, right?"
        <p></p>"Bull's-eye."
        <p></p>"It's not like it was a difficult guess. What seasonings do you have for the stir-fry?"
        <p></p>"This: yakiniku sauce."
        <p></p>"Oh… straight from the bottle, huh? I suppose it has that robust flavor that boys like…
        <p></p>and I guess it is tasty…"
        <p></p>"It's better than me trying to make something from scratch, isn't it?"
        <p></p>If Amane had no yakiniku sauce on hand, he'd planned on whipping up something that
        <p></p>used salt, pepper, and soy sauce instead. Truthfully, he was glad that he did have the
        <p></p>yakiniku sauce. Amane whispered a silent expression of gratitude for his good fortune
        <p></p>of still having a condiment he could use, then he followed Mahiru's example and
        <p></p>washed his hands.
        <p></p>While he did that, Mahiru was arranging all the necessary utensils and lining up the
        <p></p>ingredients so they would be easy to use. Truly, the angel's efficiency knew no bounds.
        <p></p>"For the veggie stir-fry, you just need to cut the vegetables up and fry them until
        <p></p>they're cooked evenly through, okay?… Do you know how to cut them?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"Are you making fun of me?" Amane replied.
        <p></p>It was obvious he knew that much. He wasn't very good at it, but he could handle a
        <p></p>knife.
        <p></p>Under Mahiru's careful supervision, Amane began to finely slice up some cabbage, but
        <p></p>he quickly realized how meaningless his earlier words had been after he cut his own
        <p></p>finger.
        <p></p>First Amane had been shown how to do it, and then Mahiru left him to try on his own
        <p></p>while she watched. He'd done fine in the beginning, while Mahiru was helping him get
        <p></p>used to the task, but as soon as she'd left Amane on his own, he'd slipped up.
        <p></p>"…Owww," he mumbled, looking down at his finger. It was only a small cut, but it was
        <p></p>bleeding.
        <p></p>The first thing to do was wash it, but of course getting it wet would sting, too.
        <p></p>"…I thought something like this might happen. Here, give me that." Mahiru took a
        <p></p>bandage from her apron pocket and skillfully wound it around Amane's hurt finger.
        <p></p>He was equal parts grateful and impressed.
        <p></p>"You're very prepared," he complimented.
        <p></p>"Beginners often hurt themselves."
        <p></p>"You have no faith in me, do you?" Despite such an accusation, Amane knew full well
        <p></p>that there was no reason for her to think he was even slightly capable. He'd hurt
        <p></p>himself almost immediately, after all.
        <p></p>"I do recognize that you were trying your best," Mahiru consoled. "That's wonderful."
        <p></p>"Gee, thanks."
        <p></p>"I still would have liked you to ask me ahead of time, though."
        <p></p>"You say that, but it would've been awful to make you cook lunch for me, too, especially
        <p></p>on a weekend."
        <p></p>"I know you're trying to handle things by yourself, but if you mess up and it becomes
        <p></p>a whole situation that ends with calling me anyway… It would be easier to have just
        <p></p>been here from the start."
        <p></p>"Fine."
        <p></p>This time, Amane had gotten away with only a light injury, but if some terrible kitchen
        <p></p>disaster had happened instead, or if he had used some appliance wrong and it stopped
        <p></p>working, he knew he wouldn't have been able to deal with it on his own. Mahiru was
        <p></p>absolutely right.
        <p></p>"…And please don't ever try to fry anything. You'll start a fire," she added.
        <p></p>"I'm nowhere near advanced enough to make fried food," Amane admitted.
        <p></p>"I don't think it's actually quite that difficult… Once again, I'm forced to wonder how
        <p></p>you survived on your own all this time," Mahiru quipped.
        <p></p>"Sorry about all this," Amane replied in a sulky voice. "Now you know why I was living
        <p></p>on convenience-store food."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked at him with concern on her face. Amane wasn't particularly disheartened
        <p></p>or angry, so she had nothing to worry about, but Mahiru cast her eyes downward,
        <p></p>seemingly a little troubled about something anyway.
        <p></p>"…It's just—I'm scared of the idea of you making fried foods, Amane, so if you really
        <p></p>want some, please come ask me instead."
        <p></p>"All right then, tomorrow I want to eat fried mince cutlets." Immediately recovering
        <p></p>his good humor, Amane was already putting in a request for the next day's dinner.
        <p></p>Mahiru gave a small, relieved sigh once she heard that.
        <p></p>"All right, but you're eating plenty of cabbage salad on the side. And I'm making miso
        <p></p>soup with lots of vegetables, got it?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah. And… thank you."
        <p></p>"For what?"
        <p></p>"For everything."
        <p></p>Mahiru did so much for Amane every day and still found time to worry about him.
        <p></p>Amane was truly grateful, even if he sometimes said stupid, hurtful things. He wasn't
        <p></p>sure where he'd be without her. Admitting as much felt a little embarrassing, though.
        <p></p>"You help me a lot," he murmured very quietly. He then promptly turned back to the
        <p></p>vegetables.
        <p></p>"Let's eat."
        <p></p>"Sounds good."
        <p></p>Grappling with the vegetables had taken nearly an hour, but it had been worth it. On
        <p></p>the table was a stir-fry made from clumsily cut greens, a beautifully shaped omelet…
        <p></p>and a pile of scrambled eggs.
        <p></p>Naturally, the beautiful omelet was one Mahiru had made in an attempt to provide
        <p></p>Amane with something to use as a reference. While Amane had tried his best to make
        <p></p>a second omelet, he'd ended up with scrambled eggs instead.
        <p></p>The failed attempt was set in front of Mahiru so she could evaluate his work. The
        <p></p>picture-perfect example, the platonic ideal of omelets, had been prepared for Amane.
        <p></p>After pressing her hands together in thanks for the food, Mahiru grabbed a piece of
        <p></p>the tattered eggs with her chopsticks to check the taste.
        <p></p>"…It's flavorless scrambled eggs, all right. Didn't you add any salt or pepper?"
        <p></p>"I forgot. Plus, I was supposed to be making an omelet."
        <p></p>"You scrambled it up too much. What were you thinking, mixing it with the chopsticks
        <p></p>until it fell apart? I warned you about that."
        <p></p>"Sorry."
        <p></p>Amane had forgotten to add the seasonings because he'd mixed up his egg while
        <p></p>Mahiru was making her omelet. Otherwise, he'd been under careful supervision
        <p></p>throughout the whole process. The lacking flavor and shape of his eggs was clearly
        <p></p>Amane's own fault.
        <p></p>On the other hand, Mahiru's dish was soft, fluffy, and unspeakably delicious. The
        <p></p>difference between them was night and day.
        <p></p>"…I think, for you, it was a really good attempt. The most important thing is that you
        <p></p>tried. Still, I'm worried that if I let you try it on your own, the cleanup afterward will
        <p></p>be awful, so I'd like you to take it slow, okay?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"…I'm going to become totally reliant on you," Amane replied.
        <p></p>"It's a little late for that."
        <p></p>"Ugh…"
        <p></p>"Just joking. Well, not really, but I like that you appreciate my cooking, and I don't hate
        <p></p>teaching you to cook, either, so… really, you don't have to worry."
        <p></p>"…Thanks again—for everything."
        <p></p>It was really thanks to Mahiru's kindness that Amane was able to live as well as he
        <p></p>was. He owed her quite a bit, but he knew that Mahiru would hate it if he groveled too
        <p></p>much, so he held his head high.
        <p></p>Curiously, Mahiru was wearing a slightly lonesome expression as she said, "If you do
        <p></p>learn how to cook, Amane, I guess I'll be relieved of my duties."
        <p></p>It was certainly true that when Amane learned to fix his own meals, there would be
        <p></p>no need for Mahiru to do it for him anymore, but Amane shook his head.
        <p></p>"No, that's… I mean… Your cooking is the best, Mahiru, so please… I want to keep
        <p></p>eating it for as long as I can. Though, I guess that's kinda shameless of me to ask."
        <p></p>Amane would never have denied it was selfish of him to want Mahiru to continue
        <p></p>cooking for him, but at the same time, her food was obviously leagues better than his,
        <p></p>and he couldn't turn it away. The addiction had long since set in, and Amane was
        <p></p>terrified of being cut off.
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes widened at the humble plea, and she smiled slightly. The vague tinge of
        <p></p>loneliness vanished in an instant.
        <p></p>"Ha-ha. You really are hopeless, aren't you? Well, I don't intend to stop, so you can
        <p></p>relax."
        <p></p>"…Thanks," Amane said, feeling relieved that the shade of anxiety he'd seen on her face
        <p></p>was gone, replaced with a faint smile.
        <p></p>"How about I get you to help me out sometimes? Peeling vegetables, measuring
        <p></p>ingredients, things like that," Mahiru proposed.
        <p></p>"Like a kid helping in the kitchen."
        <p></p>"Amane, that's where you need to start, you know?"
        <p></p>Since Amane's skill level truly was on par with a child's, there was really nothing he
        <p></p>could say back. Mahiru looked amused.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 13: Christmas with Everyone 
        <p></p>"Hey, Amane, can we have a Christmas party at your place?"
        <p></p>"Nope."
        <p></p>The proposal had been immediately shot down, and Chitose puffed out her cheeks to
        <p></p>make her disappointment obvious.
        <p></p>Christmas Eve was fast approaching, but since Amane lived separately from his family
        <p></p>and was a loner by nature, the holiday didn't hold any real significance. Still, Chitose
        <p></p>and Itsuki seemed keen on spending it with him and had come to ask him about
        <p></p>holding a little celebration.
        <p></p>Chitose had gone out of her way to barge into Amane and Itsuki's classroom at
        <p></p>lunchtime with the idea, and now she had her cheeks puffed out because of Amane's
        <p></p>near-instant refusal.
        <p></p>"Come on, Amane," Itsuki angled. "You're alone anyway… ah, unless maybe there's a
        <p></p>girlfriend in the picture?"
        <p></p>"No, there isn't."
        <p></p>"Well then, it's fine!" Chitose interjected. "Or could it be that you secretly hate us?"
        <p></p>"Well, if Amane hates us, then I guess we don't need him, either," Itsuki added.
        <p></p>In their own way, his friends were probably expressing their concern for him. There
        <p></p>was also the possibility that they were hunting for a place where they could relax and
        <p></p>flirt. Amane felt bad about refusing them, even when they made such exaggeratedly
        <p></p>disappointed faces at him. He didn't actually hate them.
        <p></p>That was not to say Amane had no concerns, however. First was the thought of how
        <p></p>the two of them would act in a private setting. Amane could feel the embarrassment
        <p></p>washing over him at the mere thought of Itsuki and Chitose's shameless intimacy.
        <p></p>Then there was the fact that he would have to explain things to Mahiru. She would
        <p></p>have to steer clear until Amane's friends left, and he would have to be very careful
        <p></p>about covering up any evidence of her frequent visits.
        <p></p>"Fine. I get it, I get it. The twenty-fourth, right? I have a condition, though: You have to
        <p></p>set me free before nightfall and go somewhere else together to get all your flirting
        <p></p>done. I'll remind you that excessive physical contact is prohibited in my apartment."
        <p></p>With Amane's concession to the couple's demands, Chitose's face lit up with a smile.
        <p></p>"Guess there's nothing we can do about that rule. I'm sure we can work something
        <p></p>out," she said.
        <p></p>"Who do you think you are to say such entitled things?" Amane quickly grabbed one
        <p></p>of Chitose's cheeks and pinched.
        <p></p>"Owwsh!" she slurred. "Itsukiii, Amane's buwwyying me!"
        <p></p>"Come on, Amane, don't be mean to Chi! I'm the only one who's allowed to pinch her
        <p></p>cheeks," Itsuki said.
        <p></p>"Fine, fine; pinch her real good for me, then," Amane replied.
        <p></p>"Leave it to me."
        <p></p>"Don't you dare!" Chitose cried.
        <p></p>Amane entrusted Itsuki to carry out the sentence, but as one might've expected, he
        <p></p>and Chitose turned it into just another excuse to flirt. Within moments, the two of
        <p></p>them started messing around, playfully pinching each other's faces.
        <p></p>Now Chitose actually looked happy to be pinched.
        <p></p>Amane shrugged. "…Can I go?"
        <p></p>This was Amane's classroom, but he wanted to get some distance from the loveydovey couple before they got any more insufferable.
        <p></p>"No way! We've got to make proper plans. We need to arrange for food and a cake!"
        <p></p>"I'm not making anything."
        <p></p>There was no way Amane could fix a Christmas meal. Mahiru could handle it, no
        <p></p>problem, but there was absolutely no way he could get her help this time. That's why
        <p></p>Amane quickly brushed off the idea, insisting that it would be impossible for him to
        <p></p>cook. Chitose didn't seem convinced, however, and was staring at him strangely.
        <p></p>"What?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"I was just thinking you look awfully healthy for someone who can't cook," Chitose
        <p></p>said.
        <p></p>"So? What's the problem?"
        <p></p>"Well, you see, Chi, Amane's got his own reasons for that," Itsuki commented.
        <p></p>"Huh, well, don't you want to know about them, too, Itsuki?"
        <p></p>"I'll get him to spill later."
        <p></p>"I'm not telling you a thing."
        <p></p>Amane glared at Itsuki as if to tell him not to make promises he couldn't keep, and he
        <p></p>laughed out loud, in a forced way. Itsuki knew when to let things go, but he had a bad
        <p></p>habit of dredging up old stuff at rather inopportune times.
        <p></p>"You guys are a real handful…," Amane muttered. "Well, for dinner, can't we get takeout
        <p></p>or something? We'll have to order the cake if we want one." Attempting to move away
        <p></p>from his own affairs that the couple seemed so eager to pry into, he made a pragmatic
        <p></p>proposal.
        <p></p>There was no way he could make a cake or prepare a meal on his own, so arranging
        <p></p>for ready-made food seemed to be the way to go.
        <p></p>"Ah, all right then, let's have pizza! I'll book a cake from my usual place; they're still
        <p></p>taking orders!" Chitose declared.
        <p></p>"You don't want chicken?" asked her boyfriend.
        <p></p>"You like pizza better, too, don't you, Itsuki?"
        <p></p>"True, true. That's my Chi; you know me best."
        <p></p>"Eh-heh-heh…"
        <p></p>While the two lovebirds had decided on what to get without discussing it at all with
        <p></p>Amane, he was fine with pizza. Something like that made it feel more like a party
        <p></p>anyway. Given the way things were going, they would probably pick up some takeaway
        <p></p>pizzas from the shop that Amane and Itsuki often visited.
        <p></p>The moment Amane heard the word pizza, he thought of Mahiru—and when she'd
        <p></p>nibbled her pizza like a small animal. Amane had found it strangely charming, probably
        <p></p>because he usually saw her eating so elegantly. Come to think of it, he'd gotten Mahiru
        <p></p>to eat cake the other day, too. Amane's cheeks glowed warmly as he remembered that.
        <p></p>I won't do anything like that again, Amane vowed to himself.
        <p></p>It'd been so embarrassing to feed each other; there was no way Amane could endure
        <p></p>a repeat of that. Mahiru and Amane weren't some affectionate couple like Itsuki and
        <p></p>Chitose, so the opportunity should never come up again anyway.
        <p></p>"…Hey, Amane, what's up?"
        <p></p>"Oh, no, nothing. All right, we'll leave the cake order up to you."
        <p></p>Amane had drifted back into some embarrassing memories for a moment, and Chitose
        <p></p>had started staring at him with a concerned expression, puzzled. Panicking, Amane
        <p></p>chased the flustering thoughts from his head and did his best to be casual.
        <p></p>"All right! Let's get our pizza order in, too!" he said, a bit more worked up than usual.
        <p></p>With Chitose's excitable voice still ringing in his ears, Amane returned home and
        <p></p>decided to ask Mahiru about her Christmas plans.
        <p></p>"Christmas plans? I don't really have any," Mahiru replied quickly from her place on
        <p></p>the sofa. Amane had posed the question after finishing the dishes and joining her in
        <p></p>the living room. He'd been confident Mahiru would be going to a girls' party, but
        <p></p>apparently, she didn't have anything lined up. Maybe Amane's surprise showed,
        <p></p>because Mahiru made an annoyed face at him.
        <p></p>"Basically, all the girls I know and most of my female classmates have boyfriends to go
        <p></p>out with. And I always turn down all the boys who invite me out, so my schedule is
        <p></p>totally open," she explained.
        <p></p>"Breaking all the hearts, huh?"
        <p></p>Whenever she was out in public, Mahiru kept her guard up, and any hopeful suitors
        <p></p>were sure to end up drowning in their own tears when faced with the angel's
        <p></p>impregnable defenses.
        <p></p>Still, Amane had to respect anyone who had the guts to ask Mahiru out. No one would
        <p></p>be able to do such a thing without a huge amount of self-confidence, and Amane
        <p></p>admired those optimistic types.
        <p></p>"…I wonder why boys want to spend Christmas with me so badly anyway?" Mahiru
        <p></p>wondered aloud.
        <p></p>"They're probably hoping to get to know you better," Amane explained.
        <p></p>"What for?"
        <p></p>"I mean, because they want to date you?"
        <p></p>"And why would they want to date me?"
        <p></p>"…Probably to do all the sorts of… things that dating people do."
        <p></p>"How obscene."
        <p></p>Amane offered a silent prayer for all the guys who'd just been ruthlessly discarded.
        <p></p>"Well, I don't think every one of them is like that, so don't be too distrustful. I'm sure
        <p></p>you understand that you're the sort of girl who draws all their eyes."
        <p></p>"You're right. It's unlikely that all of them are harboring lewd thoughts. After all, you
        <p></p>aren't like that, are you, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Have I ever treated you that way?" Amane had certainly thought Mahiru looked cute,
        <p></p>or that he wanted to rub her head, but he'd never gone so far as to fantasize about
        <p></p>being intimate with her. If such things ever did cross his mind, Amane was sure that
        <p></p>Mahiru would likely notice and pull away from him.
        <p></p>It was only because Mahiru saw Amane as a harmless puppy that he could sit there
        <p></p>next to her. Baring so much as a single fang could be enough to send her running away.
        <p></p>The needs of Amane's stomach ranked higher in his mind than other appetites, so he
        <p></p>had no intention of jeopardizing his relationship with Mahiru.
        <p></p>"I suppose you're right. You never seemed to have any interest in me from the
        <p></p>beginning, Amane."
        <p></p>"Mm-hmm."
        <p></p>"That's why I trust you."
        <p></p>"Well, thanks for that."
        <p></p>As a guy, Amane wasn't sure how he felt about Mahiru's reasons for trusting him, but
        <p></p>for the time being, he decided he was okay with being the "safe guy."
        <p></p>"…So, Amane, did you have something in mind when you asked me about my Christmas
        <p></p>plans?" Mahiru inquired.
        <p></p>"Hmm? Oh, on the afternoon of the twenty-fourth, Itsuki and Chitose are coming over,
        <p></p>so I thought I would let you know that, uh, our usual dinner might have to start late."
        <p></p>Having returned to the original topic of conversation, Amane carefully explained the
        <p></p>situation while Mahiru nodded along.
        <p></p>"I understand. Please call me once your Christmas party is over, and I'll make dinner
        <p></p>then. I'll try to take care of the prep work ahead of time," Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"Sure; sorry about all that."
        <p></p>"It's fine. Have fun."
        <p></p>"…You won't be lonely?"
        <p></p>"I'm used to spending Christmas alone."
        <p></p>Mahiru's casual attitude about spending the holiday alone struck Amane as rather
        <p></p>depressing. Perhaps thoughts of Christmas had reminded Mahiru of her parents,
        <p></p>because a small, self-deprecating laugh slipped out.
        <p></p>"…Ah, um, this is really presumptuous of me to say, but… even if I can't do Christmas
        <p></p>Eve, how about we spend Christmas Day together?" Amane felt extremely awkward
        <p></p>making this sort of suggestion. He didn't have any particular ulterior motive, but two
        <p></p>people getting together on the holiday usually did carry a certain implication.
        <p></p>There's no special meaning to this, Amane told himself. It was just that he hated when
        <p></p>Mahiru looked so lonely; that was all.
        <p></p>Surprised, Mahiru blinked quickly at the suggestion. "Together? Doing what?" she
        <p></p>asked.
        <p></p>"Huh? Ah, well, I didn't really have anything in mind. Sorry." Now that it was obvious
        <p></p>he didn't have a plan, Amane figured he should drop the issue. There was also the
        <p></p>consideration that going out together meant there was a risk of being spotted by
        <p></p>someone from school. That would be a huge problem for Amane and Mahiru both.
        <p></p>The best option would be spending time at home, but there was probably nothing in
        <p></p>Amane's apartment that would interest Mahiru. It would likely boil down to just sitting
        <p></p>next to each other, doing nothing, which would probably be incredibly awkward.
        <p></p>If that's all Amane could offer, he suspected it was probably better to just spend the
        <p></p>day apart. As he prepared to withdraw his proposal, he noticed that Mahiru was
        <p></p>staring at him quietly.
        <p></p>"…Okay. I'd like to try that," It was unexpected, but Mahiru actually seemed interested.
        <p></p>Her slim finger was pointing at the television. To be more precise, she was pointing at
        <p></p>the game console housed inside the TV stand.
        <p></p>Recently, Mahiru had been visiting in the evenings, so Amane hadn't booted up the
        <p></p>system much, but it seemed like Mahiru was curious about it.
        <p></p>"I've never used one of those things…," she confessed in a small voice.
        <p></p>Amane didn't have any concrete reason to refuse Mahiru if she wanted to try playing
        <p></p>games, but the thought of a guy and girl who weren't dating or anything spending
        <p></p>Christmas day together playing video games was somewhat surreal. Even if he wasn't
        <p></p>hoping for anything romantic, it was only natural that the idea gave rise to a confusing
        <p></p>mix of emotions.
        <p></p>"Oh, well, that'd be fine, but… is that okay? To spend the day gaming?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Is there anything wrong with that?" Mahiru replied with her own question.
        <p></p>"I guess not, but…"
        <p></p>"Well, then let's go with that."
        <p></p>"S-sure."
        <p></p>Great, I guess that's what we're doing…
        <p></p>Since it was what Mahiru wanted, Amane resolved himself to do everything he could
        <p></p>to make sure it happened. He wanted to at least give her this modest bit of enjoyment.
        <p></p>Mahiru was always taking care of him, and she hardly ever asked for anything, so he
        <p></p>would let her play anything she wanted, as long as he had it in his collection. It wasn't
        <p></p>like he had any plans on Christmas Day anyway, so this was a small price indeed for
        <p></p>Mahiru's fantastic cooking.
        <p></p>"All right, we can have a laid-back day that doesn't have anything to do with Christmas
        <p></p>or whatever," Amane declared.
        <p></p>"Then it's decided," Mahiru answered.
        <p></p>Amane found it difficult to look directly at Mahiru's smiling face, so instead he nodded
        <p></p>and turned away while doing his best to look casual.
        <p></p>"Merry Christmas!"
        <p></p>Christmas Eve arrived before too long.
        <p></p>School had already let out for winter break, and everyone was probably spending the
        <p></p>day enjoying themselves. Itsuki and Chitose had shown up at Amane's apartment,
        <p></p>party supplies in hand, at around one in the afternoon.
        <p></p>On the table, the pizza and juice they had ordered for delivery were already laid out.
        <p></p>The three had actually planned to meet up a bit earlier, but the Christmas crowds had
        <p></p>slowed everything down and put them all behind schedule. Thankfully, it was only an
        <p></p>hour past noon, and Amane hadn't been waiting too long, so no one seemed all that
        <p></p>bothered.
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah, Merry Christmas," Amane replied.
        <p></p>"Amane, you don't sound very excited! Try again," Chitose instructed.
        <p></p>"Merry Christmas!"
        <p></p>"You're saying the words just fine, but you're not really in the spirit, are you?"
        <p></p>Amane didn't like to be compared to Chitose, who was very excitable by nature.
        <p></p>Realizing that she was even more worked up than usual, Itsuki did his best to placate
        <p></p>Chitose. He flashed a flippant, yet still-warm smile at his girlfriend.
        <p></p>"Come on, we don't need to worry about that. Let's get to the eating part and the
        <p></p>having-a-good-time part and then the falling-asleep part," said Itsuki.
        <p></p>"You can't sleep here, idiot," Amane snapped.
        <p></p>"I'm just kidding, geez. Besides, if I am gonna sleep, I'm going to Chi's place."
        <p></p>"You'll have to do that when her parents aren't around."
        <p></p>"Huh, Amaneee! What kind of perverted things are you thinking?!" Chi cried. She was
        <p></p>grinning, but Amane didn't respond. Instead, he made for the kitchen to grab some
        <p></p>cups and utensils. Pouting, Chitose looked briefly disappointed at this lack of reaction
        <p></p>but then quickly followed after him, shouting that she would help.
        <p></p>The kitchen was, naturally, neat and tidy, with everything in order. Mahiru had made
        <p></p>it her territory as of late, so all the various tools and seasonings were lined up for easy
        <p></p>access.
        <p></p>"Whoa, this is way cleaner than I expected," Chitose commented.
        <p></p>"Thanks a lot," Amane responded idly. He took small plates for individual portions and
        <p></p>some cups out of a kitchen cupboard. When he tried to hand half to Chitose, he found
        <p></p>her staring fixedly at the cupboard.
        <p></p>"…What is it?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Nothing!" she answered hurriedly.
        <p></p>Amane felt something devious behind Chitose's sly smile, and a shiver shot down his
        <p></p>back. The best course of action for the time being was to ignore her entirely, however,
        <p></p>so Amane did his best to act like nothing was wrong. He had a terrible feeling Chitose
        <p></p>was brewing up some elaborate misconception, but since she hadn't said anything,
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure what it could be.
        <p></p>Grimacing, Amane and Chitose returned to the living room where Itsuki was waiting.
        <p></p>It was becoming abundantly clear that Chitose was in an even better mood than when
        <p></p>she'd first arrived.
        <p></p>"Seriously, though, your apartment is super clean. It's so big and luxurious," Chitose
        <p></p>muttered. The three friends had mostly finished eating. They'd been listening to
        <p></p>Christmas music through the speakers in the living room.
        <p></p>There was little Amane could say in response to Chitose's comment. He was living in
        <p></p>a nice apartment because his parents were paying for it, and the place was only this
        <p></p>clean because Mahiru had helped him keep it that way. After considering that, all
        <p></p>Amane could say was "Yeah, thanks."
        <p></p>"It's definitely impressive how much better the place looks now that it's clean…," Itsuki
        <p></p>remarked.
        <p></p>"Shut up…," Amane shot back.
        <p></p>"Yep, yep, I smell a girl!" Chitose added.
        <p></p>"How did you make that jump?" Amane had no idea how Chitose made the connection
        <p></p>between his clean apartment and a feminine presence.
        <p></p>"Hmm? Call it a woman's intuition. The way everything's arranged is a little off for you,
        <p></p>personality-wise. There's something about the way the books are lined up and how
        <p></p>the cords are all gathered to keep them from getting tangled or torn. Plus, there are all
        <p></p>sorts of cooking implements in the kitchen that seem like they really don't belong to
        <p></p>you, Amane."
        <p></p>"…They're my mom's," Amane lied.
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>Preemptively, Amane had shoved all of Mahiru's things into the back of a cabinet, but
        <p></p>Chitose must have caught sight of them when Amane had been getting the plates.
        <p></p>Amane's tableware alone hadn't been enough, so Mahiru had brought a few things
        <p></p>over from her place, but Amane hadn't expected Chitose to notice. For better or worse,
        <p></p>she was not the kind of person who usually paid attention to such details.
        <p></p>"Well, it's not like we care that much, right, Itsuki?" Amane's reply had been suspiciously
        <p></p>slow. Sensing a deeper meaning in that, Chitose leaned over to Itsuki, grinning.
        <p></p>Casually, and without a hint of hesitation, Itsuki reached over and rested his hand
        <p></p>between Chitose's knees as he embraced her. It was getting extremely difficult to look
        <p></p>directly at the couple.
        <p></p>"Hey, why don't you get a room, you two?!" Amane shouted.
        <p></p>"Oh, you jealous, Amane?" Itsuki asked.
        <p></p>"Psh, yeah right."
        <p></p>Rather than any sort of envy, Amane just wanted them out of his sight. He wished they
        <p></p>would stop, but this sort of behavior was business as usual for the couple. Scolding
        <p></p>them for it was a waste of energy at this point.
        <p></p>Looking very satisfied with herself as she clung to Itsuki, Chitose leaned against his
        <p></p>chest and looked up at Itsuki's face. "…I bet everyone's flirting at their own parties
        <p></p>right about now."
        <p></p>"Hey, don't forget you've got a guy right here crying bitter tears of loneliness," said
        <p></p>Amane.
        <p></p>There's no way everyone is acting like these two.
        <p></p>There had to be some people who were spending the holiday with family—and others
        <p></p>who were spending it with friends. Surely there were even some spending the holiday
        <p></p>completely alone. Amane felt like Chitose ought to choose her words more carefully.
        <p></p>Not everyone was lucky enough to spend Christmas with other people.
        <p></p>"Do boys really want sweethearts that badly?" Chitose asked.
        <p></p>"I don't think they do," Amane answered flatly. "I certainly don't."
        <p></p>"Yeah, but…," Itsuki interjected, "you're an outlier."
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>"Well, everyone gets restless right before Christmas, you know," Chitose continued.
        <p></p>"Especially single guys. The other day, I asked the angel about her Christmas plans and
        <p></p>found out she'd ruthlessly rejected just about every boy in school. She left 'em all
        <p></p>brokenhearted because she supposedly already made plans with someone else."
        <p></p>"Huh," Itsuki said.
        <p></p>Amane had a feeling that someone was him. The idea that he was little more than a
        <p></p>diplomatic excuse to turn down other dates wasn't a pleasant one, but he knew that it
        <p></p>pained Mahiru to have to refuse anyone. If having plans with Amane helped ease
        <p></p>Mahiru's conscience, then he supposed he couldn't object. After all, she wasn't giving
        <p></p>his name out, so there shouldn't be any trouble.
        <p></p>"All those poor boys looked so crushed. It was rude, but I laughed," Chitose recalled.
        <p></p>"You shouldn't laugh!" Itsuki scolded playfully.
        <p></p>"I mean, using a holiday as an excuse to try to score a date with a girl you barely know
        <p></p>is total crap, isn't it? They're already off to a late start 'cause they haven't built any kind
        <p></p>of relationship, so they try to take a convenient little shortcut to get to where they
        <p></p>really want to be. Plus, I bet those guys are the kind who'd say they were taking her to
        <p></p>a party with a lot of people but then create some excuse to be alone with her. It's a
        <p></p>scary thing, for a girl."
        <p></p>Chitose went on to add that the angel was certainly not the type to go along with those
        <p></p>kinds of games anyway, then stuck out her tongue and clung to Itsuki even more, as if
        <p></p>she'd touched on an unpleasant memory. Trendy and beautiful, Chitose had a different
        <p></p>look than Mahiru. It wouldn't have been surprising to learn that she'd had some bad
        <p></p>experiences with guys in the past. Amane felt a little sorry for her. Popular girls
        <p></p>certainly had it rough.
        <p></p>"It must be hard on Shiina, dealing with all those propositions," Amane said suddenly.
        <p></p>"…You're really not interested in the angel, are you, Amane?" Itsuki asked.
        <p></p>"Not really," Amane replied flatly.
        <p></p>"You already have that angelic next-door neighbor of yours, huh?" Chitose needled.
        <p></p>"Don't think I won't kick you out of my apartment…"
        <p></p>"No, don't! I'm sooo scaaared!" Chitose whined, clinging to Itsuki as she playfully
        <p></p>glared at Amane. "So you're not denying that your neighbor has been taking care of
        <p></p>you, right?"
        <p></p>Amane's words stuck in his throat, and Chitose grinned with smug satisfaction, though
        <p></p>her expression quickly changed when she saw his face.
        <p></p>"Don't glare at me like that! Sorry, geez…" Chitose apologized in a tone that held very
        <p></p>little remorse. When Amane narrowed his eyes at her a second time, she gave a cutesy
        <p></p>shriek and clung to Itsuki again. Then she happened to look through the window
        <p></p>behind her boyfriend.
        <p></p>Something outside was surprising enough for her to stare, so Amane also followed her
        <p></p>gaze and looked at the window, wondering what was going on. Little white flecks were
        <p></p>wafting down from the blue sky.
        <p></p>"…Ah, Itsuki, look! Snow!" Chitose cried.
        <p></p>"Whoa, a white Christmas!"
        <p></p>Snow wasn't that unusual at the end of December, but it was rare to see any on such a
        <p></p>clear day, and it seemed to delight the lovebirds.
        <p></p>It was still daytime, and the temperature was only going to drop as the sun began to
        <p></p>set. Christmas Eve was likely to be blanketed in snow this year. Couples all over town
        <p></p>were likely rejoicing, and the couple in Amane's apartment had already stepped out
        <p></p>onto his balcony for a better view.
        <p></p>"I'm sure you're going to be making out over there for a while, so I'll fix you some warm
        <p></p>drinks," Amane shouted as he watched Itsuki and Chitose head outside. As Amane was
        <p></p>standing up, a hysterical shriek suddenly caught his ear.
        <p></p>"Huh?! Wh-why are you here?"
        <p></p>"Huh, what?"
        <p></p>"Ah."
        <p></p>The last voice in the bunch was one Amane had only become accustomed to hearing
        <p></p>relatively recently. It rang clear and sweet.
        <p></p>Amane felt his stomach sink.
        <p></p>Aware that Itsuki and Chitose were huddling together on his veranda, Amane dashed
        <p></p>out in a panic and saw that Mahiru had also come out onto her own balcony to look at
        <p></p>the snow. In doing so, she had been spotted by Amane's friends the moment she'd
        <p></p>leaned over the railing.
        <p></p>Amane looked at Mahiru, who was now sitting beside him, and sighed.
        <p></p>Faced with the terrible disaster of everyone encountering each other on the balconies,
        <p></p>Amane had been left with no other option but to invite Mahiru into his apartment.
        <p></p>No matter what Amane tried now, his two friends would definitely be suspicious. At
        <p></p>this point, telling them the whole truth was probably the only way to avoid unnecessary
        <p></p>speculations and misunderstandings. Things were bound to get worse if he couldn't
        <p></p>keep Itsuki and Chitose quiet about this, too.
        <p></p>"…Um, I really am sorry," Mahiru said gently.
        <p></p>"You didn't do anything wrong."
        <p></p>It was a white Christmas and also the first snow of the year. Of course Mahiru had gone
        <p></p>to her veranda to take a look. No one could've blamed her.
        <p></p>If Amane had heard the sound of her opening her glass door, he might have been able
        <p></p>to do something, but there'd been music playing in the apartment, so he hadn't
        <p></p>noticed. Mahiru had likely been trying to stay quiet anyway.
        <p></p>Chitose was staring at Amane and Mahiru as they reflected on their carelessness, and
        <p></p>her eyes sparkled as she leaned in close. "So Amane's next-door neighbor was the
        <p></p>angel all along?!"
        <p></p>"Um, please don't call me that…" True to form, Mahiru hated being called an angel to
        <p></p>her face and politely objected to the nickname, but Chitose was grinning from ear to
        <p></p>ear, and it wasn't clear whether she was listening.
        <p></p>Itsuki, meanwhile, scratched his cheek and looked back and forth between Amane and
        <p></p>Mahiru, eyebrows raised. "Wow. So… just to recap, Shiina lives next door, and she's
        <p></p>been making you meals this whole time. Is that about right?"
        <p></p>"…Yeah," Amane admitted.
        <p></p>"W-well… um, I had a favor to repay, and I could tell by looking at him that Fujimiya
        <p></p>was not eating well, and that bothered me, so…"
        <p></p>The two tried their best to explain how they first met and why they'd continued seeing
        <p></p>each other. Itsuki acted like he understood but still wore an expression like he didn't
        <p></p>quite comprehend it.
        <p></p>Amane thought that if he were in Itsuki's position, he probably wouldn't be able to
        <p></p>grasp the whole story, either. Who would believe that an incredible girl like Mahiru
        <p></p>would so casually decide to start caring for an unremarkable slob like Amane?
        <p></p>"Hmm, so I think I understand the situation, but what's really strange about all this is
        <p></p>the idea that you don't have any ulterior motives toward Amane, Shiina. Like, you're
        <p></p>basically acting as if you're his part-time wife," said Itsuki.
        <p></p>"Guh!" Amane sputtered in surprise.
        <p></p>Wife?
        <p></p>Amane wouldn't have chosen such a word, but he had to admit that their current
        <p></p>interactions did somewhat resemble that sort of relationship. Mahiru made him
        <p></p>dinner every night and had even treated him to lunch on a recent weekend. On top of
        <p></p>that, she sometimes helped him with cleaning. On the surface, it wasn't too far off from
        <p></p>stereotypical married life. The important distinction was that neither Amane nor
        <p></p>Mahiru harbored any romantic feelings for the other.
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes had also widened slightly at Itsuki's assessment, but she very quickly
        <p></p>recovered from the shock, and Amane could see her slipping into her cordial public
        <p></p>persona. "I can assure you that I have no such intentions whatsoever."
        <p></p>Amane realized that she was handling Itsuki and Chitose the same way she handled
        <p></p>everyone else at school. Suddenly, he felt extremely embarrassed.
        <p></p>"It's perfectly innocent," Amane added. "Shiina is just helping me out, okay?"
        <p></p>"If you say so, Amane. It's just… What a strange pairing. It's really a bit hard to swallow
        <p></p>that such an incredible girl is cooking for you… Hey, that stuffed animal you bought,
        <p></p>was that also for her?"
        <p></p>"…Maybe," Amane conceded.
        <p></p>"Whaaa—?!" Chitose broke into a shout.
        <p></p>"Oh, be quiet."
        <p></p>"I haven't said anything yet, though?"
        <p></p>"Your face is loud enough."
        <p></p>"Rude!"
        <p></p>Chitose's smirk was irritating. She looked incredibly pleased with herself for having
        <p></p>"solved" this mystery. Up to this point, the conversation had proceeded without much
        <p></p>teasing, and Amane was grateful for that. He certainly didn't need any unnecessary
        <p></p>prodding right now, and Mahiru likely wouldn't be thrilled by the idea, either. Amane
        <p></p>had been hoping that Chitose would keep her mouth shut.
        <p></p>"Come on now; calm down, both of you." Itsuki put a stop to things before they really
        <p></p>got out of hand. He'd picked up on the change in Amane's demeanor and was not the
        <p></p>type to poke fun at his friend like Chitose would. Itsuki was the kind of guy who was
        <p></p>sensitive to how people felt. Of course, Amane wished he'd stopped before prying in
        <p></p>the first place, but that ship had sailed.
        <p></p>After scolding Amane and Chitose, Itsuki turned back to Mahiru, who was sitting stiffly
        <p></p>on the sidelines, and bowed his head. "…Um, Shiina, thank you for taking care of our
        <p></p>Amane."
        <p></p>"Since when did I become your kid?"
        <p></p>"I should be thanking you, for being such dear friends to Fujimiya," Mahiru answered
        <p></p>gracefully.
        <p></p>"C'mon, not you, too! You're making me sound like a worthless jerk."
        <p></p>"You kinda are, though," Itsuki remarked.
        <p></p>"Hey, screw you."
        <p></p>He'd heard Itsuki say things like that to him before, but Amane was hardly in the mood
        <p></p>right now. Mahiru could have joined in the banter, but she wisely kept silent and
        <p></p>smiled, content to watch the exchange between the two boys. She wasn't being quite
        <p></p>as expressive as she was when she was alone with Amane, but that smile lifted the veil
        <p></p>on her usual act just a little bit. Perhaps noticing, Itsuki looked befuddled.
        <p></p>Amane made a crack about Itsuki checking her out despite his being taken, and
        <p></p>Chitose started pouting and laid into Amane even harder. It was kind of funny, but
        <p></p>Mahiru had her head tilted in bemusement, so Amane downplayed his enjoyment and
        <p></p>assumed a more relaxed pose.
        <p></p>"…All right, look. We don't have a mushy-sweet relationship like you guys do, but I still
        <p></p>need you both to understand that this could get really hairy if word got out," said
        <p></p>Amane.
        <p></p>"Got it; say nothing to nobody." Evidently picking up on his friend's attempts to point
        <p></p>out the potential danger, Itsuki quickly nodded in understanding, much to Amane's
        <p></p>surprise.
        <p></p>"You too, Chitose," Amane added.
        <p></p>"I'm not that much of a chatterbox, you know. Besides, no one would believe that such
        <p></p>a cute girl is making dinner and stuff for you of all people."
        <p></p>"Well, excuse me for being so undeserving…," Amane muttered.
        <p></p>"Geez, I didn't mean it like that!"
        <p></p>Amane was well aware that what Chitose was saying was true. It was difficult to accept
        <p></p>that the star of the school was taking care of an ordinary schlub like him. If anyone did
        <p></p>believe the story, they'd probably curse Amane's very name for being so undeserving
        <p></p>of Mahiru's angelic attention. Amane was particularly imaginative when it came to
        <p></p>visualizing that last part, which was why he really didn't want the truth about their
        <p></p>relationship getting out. He could do without all the trouble.
        <p></p>Chitose laughed at Amane's sudden humility. Then her gaze shifted to Mahiru, as if her
        <p></p>eye had been drawn to something. Chitose let out a heavy sigh as she stared longingly
        <p></p>at the other girl. Mahiru quickly turned uncomfortable, like she wasn't sure what to
        <p></p>do.
        <p></p>"Um, what is it?" she asked.
        <p></p>"…It just struck me all over again. Shiina, you're ridiculously cute, aren't you?"
        <p></p>"Huh? Thank you very much…?"
        <p></p>Having praised Mahiru right to her face, Chitose continued to stare, scrutinizing every
        <p></p>last bit of her.
        <p></p>"This is my first time seeing you so close-up, but sure enough, you really are as beautiful
        <p></p>as an angel, aren't you? Your face has a nice shape, and your skin is lovely and creamy.
        <p></p>Plus, your eyelashes are long, your hair is smooth, and you're slim but still curvy!"
        <p></p>"Uh, um…?" Mahiru managed, flustered.
        <p></p>Amane sighed deeply. He couldn't deal with Chitose when she got like this. While the
        <p></p>girl definitely had her merits, there sure were some things he couldn't stand about her.
        <p></p>He couldn't put up with her high-energy personality or the fact that she was always
        <p></p>butting into other people's business.
        <p></p>Amane had a particular appreciation for how difficult she could be because he had
        <p></p>someone similar in his family. It was all the ways in which Chitose reminded him of
        <p></p>his mother that really drove him crazy. Undeniably, Chitose resembled Amane's
        <p></p>mother in taste and disposition; she was obsessed with cute things.
        <p></p>"Wow, seriously, looking closely, you're an incredible beauty—and so cute! Hey, hey,
        <p></p>can I touch your hair? I mean, do you have a secret to getting your hair so smooth and
        <p></p>shiny? What shampoo and conditioner do you use?" Chitose pressed.
        <p></p>"Wait, ah, um… so sudden…," Mahiru stammered.
        <p></p>"Your skin's so soft, too. What kind of regimen do you follow to keep it like this?"
        <p></p>Chitose, who seemed caught between a desire to share beauty secrets and a want to
        <p></p>poke and prod at the beautiful girl, stretched out a hand toward Mahiru as she
        <p></p>bombarded her with questions.
        <p></p>Amane felt sorry for Mahiru, who, despite her discomfort, was powerless against the
        <p></p>onslaught. Cursing under his breath, Amane lightly bonked Chitose on the head. It was
        <p></p>a just a tap, since the goal was simply to get Chitose to cool her heels, but she'd
        <p></p>apparently been caught by surprise as she cried "Oww!" and drew her hand back away
        <p></p>from Mahiru. As for Mahiru, she seemed relieved by Amane's intercession. He'd
        <p></p>forgotten about it because she was conducting herself with her usual angelic poise,
        <p></p>but Mahiru was extremely wary around people she wasn't used to. Chitose was a girl,
        <p></p>so Mahiru wasn't as wary as she had been with Amane, but her fear of strangers was
        <p></p>still quite clear.
        <p></p>"I can't believe you did that!" Chitose whined.
        <p></p>"She's shy, and you've only just met her, so stop trying to touch her," Amane chided.
        <p></p>"I can touch her once we get to know each other?"
        <p></p>"You'll need to ask Shiina about that. Be respectful."
        <p></p>Mahiru had obviously been getting ready to make a run for it. It was a good thing he'd
        <p></p>stepped in. Even Chitose seemed to understand why she should stop when she saw
        <p></p>how clearly shaken Mahiru was.
        <p></p>"I'm sorry; I got too excited and almost did something without asking," Chitose
        <p></p>apologized.
        <p></p>"Ah, mm-hmm…" Mahiru still seemed upset by the close call, and she looked at Amane
        <p></p>as if she didn't know what to do, her eyes pleading for help.
        <p></p>"Uh, Shiina, Chitose can be sorta a handful, but she's not a bad person… I think," Amane
        <p></p>explained.
        <p></p>"Is that supposed to be a compliment?" the excitable girl snapped.
        <p></p>"Look at the way you were acting. Can you really argue?"
        <p></p>"Nope!"
        <p></p>Chitose, having just openly disavowed her own actions, stared at Mahiru for a moment,
        <p></p>then once again extended a hand toward her, wearing a very serious expression.
        <p></p>"In that case, it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance!" This time, however, she
        <p></p>presented Mahiru with an open hand.
        <p></p>"Huh? Y-yeah, nice to meet you…" Mahiru hesitantly accepted the handshake.
        <p></p>Once Chitose took a liking to someone, Amane knew she was determined to be their
        <p></p>friend, whether they wanted it or not. Something told Amane that Mahiru would be
        <p></p>swayed by Chitose's persistence. Really, as long as she didn't do anything too weird in
        <p></p>her pursuit of Mahiru's friendship, Amane didn't mind. An ordinary, low-key
        <p></p>relationship was best.
        <p></p>"First impressions are so important for becoming good friends, you know! You
        <p></p>probably already know who I am, and I'm sure you've heard my name from Amane,
        <p></p>but I'm Chitose Shirakawa. I'm Itsuki's girlfriend. I guess you could call him… Amane's
        <p></p>best friend?"
        <p></p>"Oh my, I'm blushing! A best friend, wow," Itsuki ribbed.
        <p></p>"Don't act so flattered, Itsuki; it's weird," Amane shot back.
        <p></p>"There you go again… Hey, Amane, they've got a name for people like you, y'know…
        <p></p>sweet and sour!"
        <p></p>"I'll seriously kick you out."
        <p></p>"Forcing us outside in the snow? Oh, how cruel!"
        <p></p>"Don't try to wheedle your way out of this one."
        <p></p>Itsuki cackled with laughter, and Amane looked even more annoyed. Mahiru's eyes
        <p></p>went wide as she watched their exchange.
        <p></p>"Oh, we always act like this," Itsuki informed her as he smiled cheerfully. "So anyway,
        <p></p>I'm Itsuki Akazawa. I'm best friends with that knucklehead over there. If Amane ever
        <p></p>does anything stupid or weird, you can come talk to me any time."
        <p></p>"Is that any way to talk about your best friend?" Amane said.
        <p></p>"…Well, Fujimiya doesn't seem to have any interest in me," Mahiru said. "He may not
        <p></p>have any basic life skills, but he's an otherwise ordinary guy, so I'm not expecting any
        <p></p>trouble."
        <p></p>"Thanks, I guess… but you could have left out the part about me being incompetent."
        <p></p>Amane could have gone without that specific remark, but he was happy to hear that
        <p></p>Mahiru did indeed see him as a person she could trust.
        <p></p>Itsuki drew close and whispered in Amane's ear, "You've gotten awfully close to Shiina
        <p></p>for somebody who says he's not interested."
        <p></p>Amane would be lying if he said he wasn't interested at all, but he really wasn't actively
        <p></p>trying to steer their relationship in that direction. He was certain that Mahiru just
        <p></p>wanted a close friend, not a romantic partner. The two of them were happy spending
        <p></p>their time together as they had been.
        <p></p>Glancing at Mahiru, Amane saw that she'd gotten all flustered again. Chitose had
        <p></p>begun another round of interrogation, having decided her conversation with Amane
        <p></p>was over.
        <p></p>However, Mahiru didn't seem to hate the attention, and Amane hoped that maybe
        <p></p>when she got more comfortable, she might relax a little.
        <p></p>As bewildered as she was, Mahiru responded to the barrage of questions with a small
        <p></p>smile. It came as no small relief for Amane that the two girls were getting acquainted
        <p></p>without any issue.
        <p></p>"I'm really sorry."
        <p></p>After night had fallen, and Itsuki and Chitose had gone home, Amane apologized to
        <p></p>Mahiru, who looked more than a little worn-out.
        <p></p>It was obvious that Mahiru had been left exhausted and confused after dealing with
        <p></p>two strangers who'd just discovered their secret. This conversation felt like an exact
        <p></p>repeat of the one they'd had after Shihoko's surprise visit.
        <p></p>"No, my own carelessness was what caused it, after all," Mahiru refuted.
        <p></p>"They sure did make a fuss."
        <p></p>"They're… lively people."
        <p></p>"You can be honest; they're both loudmouths."
        <p></p>"They were a little assertive, but they're interesting."
        <p></p>"'A little' is being very generous… Well, as long as you didn't mind, I guess it's all good."
        <p></p>Amane was convinced that his friends' behavior had crossed the line for Mahiru, but
        <p></p>the mild-mannered girl was taking it all in stride. He was glad that she hadn't found
        <p></p>them too troublesome, but he wasn't sure whether it was a good thing that she and
        <p></p>Chitose were apparently becoming friends.
        <p></p>Chitose is a totally different type of girl from Mahiru. Very… energetic? Which is nice, I
        <p></p>suppose. He trusted Chitose not to do anything malicious, but he would need to keep
        <p></p>an eye on her to be certain she gave Mahiru enough space.
        <p></p>"I don't have any people like that in my life, so it was kind of fun."
        <p></p>"Right, I imagine you don't really have anyone like Chitose in your circle… If she gets
        <p></p>too persistent, you can just slap her, okay?"
        <p></p>"I w-would never resort to violence, so I'll do my best to keep her in check with my
        <p></p>words."
        <p></p>Chitose had an excess of energy and often let her enthusiasm get the better of her.
        <p></p>Amane was sure that eventually his advice would be warranted. As he fixed in his mind
        <p></p>an oath to caution Chitose directly the next time he saw her, Amane turned toward the
        <p></p>window and watched the snow fluttering down.
        <p></p>If it weren't for this weather, we never would've been discovered, he thought. Snowflakes
        <p></p>were supposed to carry good tidings for lovers everywhere, however, so Amane didn't
        <p></p>think it right to curse them for his troubles.
        <p></p>Mahiru also seemed to enjoy watching the snow because, once she realized what
        <p></p>Amane was looking at, she stared out the window in the exact same way.
        <p></p>It was winter, so the sun had set early. The sky was dark, and the snow was pale, and
        <p></p>he could just barely see the flakes falling in the light coming from the surrounding
        <p></p>apartment buildings.
        <p></p>"A white Christmas, huh?" Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"Yeah, I guess so," Amane answered. "Though, that sappy stuff doesn't have much to
        <p></p>do with us."
        <p></p>"It's still very pretty. Isn't that enough?"
        <p></p>Spending a romantic white Christmas together didn't mean anything to them, since
        <p></p>they weren't a couple, but… Mahiru seemed to be enjoying the sight anyway, so the
        <p></p>snow couldn't be all bad.
        <p></p>The dancing snowflakes lightly dusted the surroundings, leaving the dark world
        <p></p>coated in a powdery whiteness. At the rate it was falling, the chance of the snow really
        <p></p>piling up didn't seem very high.
        <p></p>"If it's too heavy, though, public transit will shut down, so I hope it's only a light snow,"
        <p></p>Mahiru commented.
        <p></p>"That's very pragmatic of you," Amane remarked.
        <p></p>"People can't survive on romance alone," Mahiru answered.
        <p></p>"You're exactly right."
        <p></p>Albeit in an unusual way, the snow had brought them closer together, after all.
        <p></p>They both smiled slightly, and Mahiru stood up.
        <p></p>"All right then, I'll bring dinner over."
        <p></p>"Huh, bring it over?"
        <p></p>"I made beef stew at my place earlier. I thought for sure that if I roasted a whole turkey,
        <p></p>the two of us wouldn't be able to finish it…"
        <p></p>"It would never have even occurred to me to roast a turkey."
        <p></p>"You're just bad at cooking, Amane. For lunch tomorrow, I was thinking we could make
        <p></p>omelet rices with beef stew on top."
        <p></p>"That sounds so delicious…" Amane's mind had already leaped straight past tonight's
        <p></p>dinner and had started looking forward to tomorrow's lunch. "I like my eggs cooked
        <p></p>hard."
        <p></p>"What a coincidence; I've always preferred them that way, too. Okay, I'm bringing the
        <p></p>stew pot over."
        <p></p>Mahiru sauntered out of Amane's apartment and headed back to her own place for a
        <p></p>moment. Vacantly, Amane watched her as she left, reflecting on the turbulent day.
        <p></p>He really hadn't expected to be discovered. His friends might have suspected that
        <p></p>something was up, and Amane had anticipated them growing curious, but he never
        <p></p>would've expected that Mahiru would simply step right onto center stage.
        <p></p>Part of him wished that their relationship could've stayed their secret for just a little
        <p></p>while longer.
        <p></p>What am I thinking? Amane wondered. It was better this way. He no longer had to hide
        <p></p>everything from Itsuki and Chitose, which made his life much easier. So then why did
        <p></p>he feel a bit wistful? Where was this strange feeling coming from? Though everything
        <p></p>had turned out okay, some part of Amane was still agitated, and he needed to relax.
        <p></p>"Did something happen?" Mahiru had returned, holding the stew pot, and she tilted
        <p></p>her head questioningly as she stared at Amane with a confused look.
        <p></p>"…It's nothing." Amane straightened out his expression, but Mahiru still seemed
        <p></p>puzzled for a good while by the expression she had spotted on his face.
        <p></p>"…Phew, that was good."
        <p></p>Unsurprisingly, Mahiru's cooking had been delicious. With it being Christmas, she had
        <p></p>made even more elaborate dishes than usual. She had turned the rest of her carefully
        <p></p>simmered beef stew into a pot pie, which she and Amane had shared.
        <p></p>Splitting the pie open and eating the crispy, textured crust together with the rich sauce
        <p></p>of the beef stew could only be described as a moment of sublime bliss.
        <p></p>Mahiru had apparently prepared the pie dough especially for this. Truly impressed by
        <p></p>her culinary prowess, Amane loosed a contented sigh while polishing off his second
        <p></p>pastry of the day, another product of Mahiru's skilled hands.
        <p></p>While making the dough for the pot pie, Mahiru had apparently taken the opportunity
        <p></p>to prepare another type of sweet dough at the same time. She'd used it to make
        <p></p>handmade mille-feuille for dessert. This girl was already working at a professional
        <p></p>level.
        <p></p>"I'm glad you like it… You sure ate plenty," Mahiru observed.
        <p></p>"Mm. Because it was delicious," Amane replied.
        <p></p>"Thank you for saying so."
        <p></p>Amane had grown accustomed to seeing the faint, relieved smile that emerged on
        <p></p>Mahiru's face whenever he complimented her food. He had made it his daily mission
        <p></p>to see that expression, as it was so much softer than her usual reserved countenance.
        <p></p>Though an embarrassing thought, Amane liked to think of it as a special kind of smile
        <p></p>reserved just for him.
        <p></p>"…So tomorrow we're having omelets over rice, huh…? I'm really looking forward to
        <p></p>it."
        <p></p>"You really do like eggs, don't you? You tore into those rolled dashi omelets with
        <p></p>incredible enthusiasm."
        <p></p>"They were delicious; I couldn't help it."
        <p></p>Even though eggs were one of his favorite foods, Amane couldn't stand them if they
        <p></p>were badly cooked. The fact that he'd wolfed them down was just more proof of
        <p></p>Mahiru's excellent preparation.
        <p></p>Though Amane recognized that it was awfully selfish to be keeping her cooking all to
        <p></p>himself, he was not inclined to share with anybody else. The plan was to keep enjoying
        <p></p>it for as long as possible.
        <p></p>"…Amane, you look super happy when you're eating, you know?" Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"Of course, because your cooking is so good," he replied.
        <p></p>"I'm flattered, but… really, it's nothing that special."
        <p></p>"No, it definitely is… You need to get a better sense of your own worth…"
        <p></p>This was the homemade food of an angel; there were more than a few boys who'd do
        <p></p>anything to have some.
        <p></p>"But to me, this is just the stuff I make every day."
        <p></p>"I'm a lucky guy."
        <p></p>"…Why's that?"
        <p></p>"Because the stuff you make every day is so delicious."
        <p></p>Amane was a boy ruled by his stomach, and being able to enjoy delicious, freshly made
        <p></p>meals so regularly was, for him, the ultimate happiness.
        <p></p>"How did you get so good at cooking anyway?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Someone important to me once said 'Make sure you grab anyone who makes you
        <p></p>happy by the stomach,' and I took those words to heart," Mahiru answered.
        <p></p>"Sorry you ended up grabbing me instead."
        <p></p>"I'm thinking of it as a rehearsal." Mahiru's candor caught Amane by surprise. A small
        <p></p>smile spread across her lips.
        <p></p>"…But seriously, whoever taught you must have been amazing."
        <p></p>"That's right; they were an incredible cook. I'm still no match for them. Their cooking
        <p></p>tasted like pure happiness." Mahiru took on a faraway look with a gentle smile. The
        <p></p>expression felt reassuring to Amane.
        <p></p>From the way Mahiru described it, the person in question had obviously loved her
        <p></p>very much, and Amane could tell that Mahiru had idolized them as well. She must have
        <p></p>been really lucky to have someone like that in her life.
        <p></p>"I bet it was really good," Amane said, nodding. "But you know… to me, your cooking
        <p></p>is what tastes like happiness."
        <p></p>Leaving his mother aside for the moment, Amane's father was a decent cook, but
        <p></p>Mahiru's dishes suited Amane's tastes better. Mahiru's cooking was comforting yet
        <p></p>exciting, with a relaxing flavor that he didn't think he could get tired of, even if he had
        <p></p>it three times a day for the rest of his life. No matter how much he ate, he just wanted
        <p></p>more and more.
        <p></p>Though, of course, he could never say that. It'd put too much of a burden on Mahiru.
        <p></p>Suddenly, the girl stiffened. She looked like she'd been attacked in an unguarded
        <p></p>moment. She stared at Amane with an innocent and somewhat vacant expression.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Ah… it's nothing." Snapping back to her senses, Mahiru quickly shook her head, then
        <p></p>stared down at the floor. Hugging her favorite cushion tight, she let out a soft sigh.
        <p></p>Something about her had completely changed in the last few seconds. It was strangely
        <p></p>endearing.
        <p></p>"What's up?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"…It's just—to think that someone like me could make something taste like happiness…"
        <p></p>"I don't know why you're putting yourself down, but your food is so good that I want
        <p></p>to eat it every day."
        <p></p>"Th-thank you." Mahiru looked up at Amane with a bit of a bashful look and a small
        <p></p>grin. The sight of it filled Amane with the urge to hide his face.
        <p></p>This kind of expression was rare for Mahiru, but it inevitably set Amane's heart
        <p></p>rattling in his chest, even though he'd constantly told himself that he wasn't interested
        <p></p>in her like that. Seeing Mahiru's smiling visage stripped of its usual stony mask made
        <p></p>him suddenly feel hot, and Amane worried that she would notice and get embarrassed
        <p></p>herself.
        <p></p>"Say, um, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Yes?"
        <p></p>"Tomorrow we'll be meeting up around lunchtime, right?"
        <p></p>Unable to stand the atmosphere any longer, Amane forced a change of subject. Mahiru
        <p></p>didn't seem to take much notice, however, and she idly considered what Amane had
        <p></p>asked.
        <p></p>"Yes, that's the plan, isn't it? We'll make lunch, then play games like we promised…
        <p></p>That was it, right?"
        <p></p>"Yeah."
        <p></p>"Unless… you don't want to?"
        <p></p>"No, I was just confirming. Really, even though we spent Christmas Eve together, are
        <p></p>you sure it's okay to spend your next day with me, too?"
        <p></p>"If I hated the idea, I wouldn't have suggested it… I'm looking forward to it." Another
        <p></p>small smile appeared on the gentle curve of Mahiru's lips.
        <p></p>"Y-yeah," Amane muttered. It was all he could do to turn away and hide his growing
        <p></p>embarrassment.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 14: Christmas for Two 
        <p></p>When Mahiru arrived at Amane's apartment the following day, she seemed a little
        <p></p>restless. It would've been perfectly understandable to be nervous about visiting the
        <p></p>home of a member of the opposite sex on a holiday, but that didn't seem to be it.
        <p></p>Mahiru wants to play games. She's probably just excited.
        <p></p>Apparently, this would be her first time ever playing a video game. In some ways, she
        <p></p>was like a sheltered highborn young lady who knew little of the world at large.
        <p></p>"Before we play, I'll make lunch, okay?" Mahiru confirmed.
        <p></p>"Mm. I'll have mine well-done, please," Amane answered casually.
        <p></p>"I know; I remember."
        <p></p>Even dealing with such a demanding customer didn't seem to dampen the girl's mood.
        <p></p>With a flutter of her apron, she headed for the kitchen and began preparations for
        <p></p>lunch. From the way she was behaving, Mahiru seemed to be quite pleased.
        <p></p>Amane felt a little awkward and embarrassed about how much he had been looking
        <p></p>forward to this.
        <p></p>It's just because I'm looking forward to enjoying the games, that's all, he told himself. It
        <p></p>certainly was not that he had been excited about spending time alone with the nextdoor angel. As he watched Mahiru's ponytail swaying back and forth, Amane smiled
        <p></p>wryly to himself.
        <p></p>"…How are you supposed to hold it?"
        <p></p>After lunch, the two of them settled on the sofa in front of the TV. Both were now
        <p></p>looking straight at the screen.
        <p></p>When Amane had asked her what game she wanted to play, it became apparent that
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't even know where to start, so he'd booted up a well-known 2D game and
        <p></p>handed her a controller. Unfortunately, Mahiru immediately got flustered as it became
        <p></p>apparent that she had no idea what to do with it.
        <p></p>"Uh, okay, so you move around with this joystick, and you jump with this button…"
        <p></p>Mahiru, usually so calm and collected, was looking back and forth between the
        <p></p>controller and the TV as she manipulated her character on-screen. It was obvious that
        <p></p>this was her first time. She charged straight at the enemies without dodging, dying
        <p></p>over and over again. Amane began to wonder if perhaps there were things even an
        <p></p>angel couldn't do, though she did seem to be gradually improving, if ever so slowly.
        <p></p>"…I can't win," Mahiru professed.
        <p></p>"Never mind clearing the stage—you haven't even defeated the first enemy," Amane
        <p></p>observed.
        <p></p>"Oh, shut up."
        <p></p>"Well, it's just a matter of practice; you gotta keep trying. Get that muscle memory."
        <p></p>Amane warned Mahiru that it would be a challenge, but she didn't seem ready to give
        <p></p>up. It was charming to watch the girl tackle the game with such a serious expression.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help but smile.
        <p></p>Unfortunately, Mahiru was just too much of a beginner and kept on losing. Eventually,
        <p></p>it was obvious that she was growing frustrated. As she shot a glance at Amane, he
        <p></p>could have sworn he heard a gamelike sound effect accompany her sullen face.
        <p></p>"Ah, here, you need to do it like this…" Mahiru was sure to lose interest if she continued
        <p></p>to metaphorically bash her head against a wall, so Amane put his hand on the
        <p></p>controller she was holding and tried to physically show her what to do.
        <p></p>Amane had cleared this game on countless occasions, so he was able to help Mahiru
        <p></p>get through tough spots. Surprisingly, Mahiru was actually worse than the average
        <p></p>player. Most people wouldn't have gotten stuck nearly as many times as she did, but
        <p></p>Amane kept that thought private.
        <p></p>"Look, this enemy moves at a consistent speed in an irregular pattern, but if you watch
        <p></p>here, he moves toward your character and speeds up as he approaches. Just watch
        <p></p>your timing and jump."
        <p></p>Amane put his hand over Mahiru's smaller one and gripped the controller to
        <p></p>manipulate the character on the TV, showing her how as he explained. On the screen,
        <p></p>the game character moved as Amane had said it would, avoiding the oncoming enemy.
        <p></p>It wasn't much of a move, but it was apparently enough to impress Mahiru, who let out
        <p></p>a small gasp of astonishment. Her eyes, rimmed with long lashes, snapped wide open,
        <p></p>and her expression brightened.
        <p></p>The two were sitting closer together than they ever had before, and Amane noticed
        <p></p>for the first time that Mahiru's lower lashes were fairly long, too. Smiling, he watched
        <p></p>Mahiru happily play.
        <p></p>As Amane admired her beautiful profile, Mahiru turned toward him, possibly because
        <p></p>she'd felt his eyes on her. He'd needed to get close in order to be able to reach the
        <p></p>controller, so the two had ended up far nearer to each other than either had expected.
        <p></p>Their arms and hands were even touching, and Amane could feel Mahiru's breath
        <p></p>lightly grazing his skin. Amane found himself surrounded by warmth and a faint, sweet
        <p></p>fragrance.
        <p></p>"S-sorry…" Amane suddenly realized that his hands were almost completely covering
        <p></p>Mahiru's, and he pulled away in a panic, while Mahiru's eyes darted around the room
        <p></p>as if she had only just realized they were touching at all.
        <p></p>Blinking dramatically, Mahiru replied, "No… it's fine. I'm the one who should apologize."
        <p></p>The girl's cheeks had flushed scarlet, and Amane was filled with regret over what he'd
        <p></p>done.
        <p></p>Mahiru wasn't a fan of physical contact. No matter how used to each other they had
        <p></p>gotten, having someone touch her hands like that had probably been too much for her.
        <p></p>Thankfully, while she looked fairly embarrassed, she didn't appear upset or angry.
        <p></p>"Really, I'm sorry," Amane said again.
        <p></p>"Um, I'm not that bothered by it…," Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"Don't you hate physical contact?"
        <p></p>"…I was surprised but not upset. It's not like you're a stranger."
        <p></p>It seemed that today, the magnanimous angel had seen fit to forgive Amane's
        <p></p>transgression. Relieved at how easily Mahiru let it go, Amane restarted the game.
        <p></p>Fixing his eyes on the TV screen, Amane got ready to help Mahiru make some real
        <p></p>progress in the game this time. Then he saw that her character had fallen off the
        <p></p>stage—a rather predictable outcome. Amane was seriously beginning to wonder if he
        <p></p>could do anything to help her get better.
        <p></p>In the end, Mahiru somehow managed to clear one level, whining all the while. The
        <p></p>two of them agreed that was probably a good stopping place for the time being.
        <p></p>If Amane kept making a total beginner face death, it would have a considerable effect
        <p></p>on her motivation. His plan for now was to get her to try another game and loosen up.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, you're tilting."
        <p></p>To that end, next Amane had suggested a racing game, since that had some grounding
        <p></p>in the real world, but Mahiru was leaning with her entire body.
        <p></p>There was no gyroscopic control element to the game, so there was absolutely no need
        <p></p>to physically move around. Amane wasn't sure whether Mahiru even noticed what she
        <p></p>was doing, but she swayed left and right with every turn she made in the game.
        <p></p>In contrast to the earlier game, this one was all about driving a car, and Amane had
        <p></p>thought it'd be easier, since pretty much everyone understood the concept of driving
        <p></p>to some degree. Playing through the tutorial also might've helped, because even
        <p></p>though Mahiru's driving was a bit clumsy, she was able to handle the actual gameplay.
        <p></p>She was trying her absolute hardest to perform well. Her body swayed this way and
        <p></p>that while she maintained a very serious expression.
        <p></p>This is ridiculously cute, Amane thought.
        <p></p>Mahiru was strangely adorable, rocking back and forth like a pendulum. Her intense
        <p></p>focus and effort only made her look even cuter.
        <p></p>With every turn, Mahiru's body automatically leaned way to the side. Eventually, she
        <p></p>tumbled right onto Amane's lap, and he was forced to choke down a laugh.
        <p></p>"…You really don't need to tilt your whole body, you know?" he said.
        <p></p>"I-it wasn't on purpose," Mahiru replied sheepishly.
        <p></p>"Yeah, I know. But still, you were leaning pretty far."
        <p></p>Mahiru sat back up, somehow keeping her trembling, pouty lips in check.
        <p></p>The girl had felt soft and light when she'd accidentally flopped on him. That much was
        <p></p>to be expected as Mahiru had a small build, but she was so slim that sometimes Amane
        <p></p>worried she might snap in half.
        <p></p>Roused out of Amane's lap, Mahiru's cheeks were flushing, and her body was
        <p></p>trembling, likely from embarrassment. It was times like these that the girl really
        <p></p>resembled a small animal.
        <p></p>Finally, Amane couldn't stand it anymore, and he burst into a fit of laughter.
        <p></p>"A-are you making fun of me?" Mahiru demanded.
        <p></p>"No, no. I was just thinking how charming you are."
        <p></p>"So you are making fun of me!"
        <p></p>"You think I'd mock someone while they're trying their best?"
        <p></p>"No, but…"
        <p></p>"See? You were just very cute; that's all."
        <p></p>"…When you say cute, I'm sure you mean childish."
        <p></p>There was a bit of a peevish overtone to Mahiru's words, and Amane was worried she
        <p></p>might get depressed if he teased too much; thus he decided to keep any further
        <p></p>thoughts to himself. He flashed Mahiru a half smile in response to her expression of
        <p></p>disapproval, and she quickly turned away.
        <p></p>Any trace of the angel's gloomy mood vanished instantly when she returned to the
        <p></p>game. Her intense concentration overrode everything else on her face. It was
        <p></p>becoming clear that she was getting used to the game, as she was managing to keep
        <p></p>up with the other cars, if a little awkwardly. Amane had been right to assume a more
        <p></p>familiar concept like steering a car was better for Mahiru. She did still veer off course
        <p></p>into the dirt or slam into a wall a few times, though.
        <p></p>Amane had been worried she might end up running the whole course backward, since
        <p></p>she'd never played a game before, but he was relieved to see that she was making
        <p></p>better progress than he'd expected.
        <p></p>Trying to play the racing game together with Mahiru proved to be a little difficult, as
        <p></p>she kept distracting Amane without realizing it. As she tilted her whole body back and
        <p></p>forth with the game, she occasionally leaned right into him. Each time she did so, a
        <p></p>lovely scent would waft over him, making it difficult to keep his composure.
        <p></p>Even with the unusual handicap, Amane still managed to maintain a huge lead. They
        <p></p>were competing against the weakest computer opponents, after all.
        <p></p>"…How are you so fast?" Mahiru inquired.
        <p></p>"Practice and experience," Amane replied.
        <p></p>After playing the game so many times, Amane knew the course by heart and understood
        <p></p>how to best navigate the turns. Even with Mahiru's outside interference, he was able
        <p></p>to seize every advantage and hold the lead without much trouble.
        <p></p>Glancing back at Mahiru, who appeared utterly dumbstruck, Amane quietly switched
        <p></p>the game to solo mode and dropped out of the competition. Mahiru didn't have enough
        <p></p>experience, so Amane thought it'd be better to play together after he let her practice
        <p></p>by herself for a while. It was better that she got comfortable playing against computercontrolled characters rather than feel disappointed over losing to Amane.
        <p></p>Thankfully, it was clear that Mahiru had no shortage of determination, and she stared
        <p></p>enthusiastically at the screen even after going to solo play. With an attitude like that,
        <p></p>Amane was sure she would quickly learn to hold her own against a computer opponent.
        <p></p>It was obvious what a hard worker she was, even with something like a video game.
        <p></p>Such perseverance was rather charming, but whenever Amane let a smile slip onto his
        <p></p>face, Mahiru would quickly take notice and slap his knees in protest.
        <p></p>If he laughed too much, amused by her protests, Mahiru would frown and grumble,
        <p></p>"Amane, you idiot."
        <p></p>"I won."
        <p></p>After two hours of dogged perseverance, Mahiru crossed the finish line as the words
        <p></p>FIRST PLACE flashed across the screen. She turned to look at Amane, obviously proud
        <p></p>of herself.
        <p></p>After a hard-won battle with the racing game, Mahiru had achieved the glory of
        <p></p>finishing first.
        <p></p>Though she'd ended up in last place on so many earlier tries, Mahiru had refused to
        <p></p>quit and kept going, improving her ranking bit by bit until at last, she won. Such
        <p></p>investment had probably made the victory quite emotional.
        <p></p>Mahiru's expression seemed to proclaim "I did it!" and Amane dutifully clapped in
        <p></p>admiration.
        <p></p>"That's great. I could tell you really tried hard," he praised.
        <p></p>"Yep!" Perhaps because Mahiru was enjoying the praise, her usual demeanor had
        <p></p>softened, and she appeared a little bashful. She didn't break into a huge, obvious grin
        <p></p>but instead wore a fleeting, shy curl of the lips that looked ever-so-slightly pleased. It
        <p></p>seemed so sweet that it was hard to believe it belonged to the same cool, reserved
        <p></p>person.
        <p></p>Recently, Mahiru had been acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect
        <p></p>young lady. Today most of all, she was really acting like a kid. Her cherubic smile had
        <p></p>something innocent about it, and looking at her, Amane felt his sense of reason begin
        <p></p>to give way as the roaring desire to hold her close rose within him. The urge to pet
        <p></p>Mahiru like a cat seized control of his arm, and before he knew it, Amane found himself
        <p></p>reaching out toward her.
        <p></p>"Is something the matter?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>Quickly, Amane regained control of his wayward limb. "Ah, n-no, it's nothing. You really
        <p></p>got good at this, h-huh?"
        <p></p>"I'm getting better?"
        <p></p>"For sure. You're way better than when you first started."
        <p></p>"Thank you. It was a lot of fun, so I guess I got pretty engrossed." Mahiru chuckled to
        <p></p>herself.
        <p></p>Amane avoided making eye contact by crossing the room and retrieving a small box
        <p></p>from a basket on the shelf. "Let's say this is your prize for first place," he said.
        <p></p>"Ah, um, that's really not—"
        <p></p>"If you don't like the idea of a prize, then think of this as something left behind by a
        <p></p>stout old man with a white beard and a red suit."
        <p></p>It was a Christmas present that Amane had carelessly forgotten to give Mahiru the day
        <p></p>before.
        <p></p>Since Mahiru's birthday and Christmas weren't that far apart, Amane had expected
        <p></p>some difficulty picking out this second gift. Thankfully, he'd also gotten a little more
        <p></p>familiar with the practice, so it surprisingly wound up not being as tough to choose a
        <p></p>Christmas present as it had been finding one for Mahiru's birthday.
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked rapidly, as if the reference to a Christmas present had just reminded
        <p></p>her that today was in fact Christmas, and she nervously accepted the box. At Amane's
        <p></p>urging, she carefully undid the wrapping.
        <p></p>Well, it's nothing special, though, Amane thought.
        <p></p>She opened the box and slowly took out the gift. It was a leather key holder.
        <p></p>Expecting Mahiru to feel uncomfortable if Amane got her something too expensive,
        <p></p>Amane had avoided getting a fancy brand-name item. He'd selected this one purely
        <p></p>because the design seemed like it would suit Mahiru.
        <p></p>It was simple, with flowers and ivy carved into the leather, making it perfect for
        <p></p>everyday use. Amane wasn't too well versed in flowers, so he didn't know exactly
        <p></p>which ones were featured in the design, but he thought their dainty forms suited
        <p></p>Mahiru well, and that's why he'd chosen it.
        <p></p>"Well, I gave you my spare key and all. If you don't want to use it, that's okay, too,"
        <p></p>Amane said.
        <p></p>"No, I definitely will, thank you. You've got a better sense of style than I expected,
        <p></p>Amane," Mahiru replied.
        <p></p>"What do you mean, better than expected?"
        <p></p>"I mean, normally you just wear sweatpants or jeans… It's not like you're into fashion
        <p></p>or anything."
        <p></p>"I just don't own anything besides functional clothes."
        <p></p>Getting dressed up in nicer outfits was a tedium that Amane avoided whenever
        <p></p>possible. He'd never had the occasion to show Mahiru what he looked like in better
        <p></p>clothing, so she'd only ever seen him in his school uniform and casual house clothes.
        <p></p>It was no wonder she assumed he had no fashion sense. Such a guess had been right
        <p></p>on the money, and Amane didn't seem likely to dispel that slovenly impression
        <p></p>anytime soon.
        <p></p>"…If you made an effort, you'd probably look pretty good, you know? You kept up your
        <p></p>appearance in middle school, didn't you?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"That was because my mom forced me to… Wait, how do you know that?"
        <p></p>"Shihoko sent me this picture and said, 'Here's what he could look like if he tried'…"
        <p></p>"Unbelievable."
        <p></p>Amane was shocked to see the photo of the time his mother had dressed him up and
        <p></p>brought him to work. Silently, Amane cursed his mother's indiscretion.
        <p></p>"…That style didn't suit me."
        <p></p>"I suppose you're right, Amane. You know, you never make eye contact, and your face
        <p></p>is always hidden behind your hair, but I think you have rather distinguished features…"
        <p></p>Mahiru's small hand stretched out toward Amane's face, and her white palm brushed
        <p></p>against his forehead as she pushed his long bangs upward. She was looking at him
        <p></p>with a curious expression. He didn't think his face was anything to marvel over; it was
        <p></p>perfectly ordinary—not quite ugly and not quite handsome. Amane began to wonder
        <p></p>why Mahiru was staring so intently at him.
        <p></p>"…What is it?" he asked.
        <p></p>"Nothing. Your eyes look livelier than they used to, that's all," Mahiru replied.
        <p></p>Without looking away, Mahiru reminded Amane that several months earlier, his face
        <p></p>had been vacant like a zombie's.
        <p></p>While Mahiru continued to stare, Amane was beginning to feel uncomfortable that a
        <p></p>girl, not to mention an incredible beauty, was staring at him so intently. He wondered
        <p></p>what she found so fascinating about his boring looks.
        <p></p>Eventually, he couldn't stand it anymore. Amane slowly reached out and brushed a
        <p></p>lock of hair away from Mahiru's own lovely face. He was hesitant to touch her, but she
        <p></p>had reached out and touched his hair so casually that he thought she'd probably
        <p></p>forgive him for doing the same. It would only be the faintest moment of contact; surely
        <p></p>that much would be all right.
        <p></p>But wow, she really is beautiful…
        <p></p>Mahiru was much prettier than the glamorous models in the magazines that had
        <p></p>previously been scattered around Amane's room—and much more appealing.
        <p></p>Something about her felt amazing every time he looked upon her.
        <p></p>Photographs, Amane knew, couldn't be trusted anyway. Even if they could capture a
        <p></p>moment of beauty, preserving it in time, photographs could be made to deceive.
        <p></p>Mahiru, however, was standing there before him in the flesh. Her beauty was real—
        <p></p>unadulterated. Amane didn't think he could ever get tired of beholding such a creature.
        <p></p>As Amane continued studying her features, Mahiru's eyes started to shift, and she
        <p></p>pulled away from him, dropping her controller. Amane wondered what was bothering
        <p></p>her as she hugged a nearby couch cushion tight against her chest.
        <p></p>"Um. So… right. I have a Christmas present for you, too."
        <p></p>"Um, oh, thanks."
        <p></p>Amane was about to ask what on earth it might be, when Mahiru cut him off by pulling
        <p></p>out a nicely decorated gift bag from her purse. Hastily, she pushed it into his hands.
        <p></p>"All right, I'm going to prepare dinner."
        <p></p>"Huh? Y-you are…?"
        <p></p>With those words, Mahiru quickly stood and moved to the kitchen. Amane was left
        <p></p>with nothing but bewilderment at the overly rapid development.
        <p></p>After Amane finished washing the dishes from dinner, he returned to the living room
        <p></p>to find that Mahiru was restless. She was sitting beside him, in the way they had
        <p></p>recently grown accustomed to, but this time, Mahiru was having trouble maintaining
        <p></p>her composure. She'd been averting her gaze all through dinner, too.
        <p></p>This was a kind of self-consciousness that Mahiru had seemed previously incapable
        <p></p>of, prompting Amane to wonder if something had happened. Perhaps it had something
        <p></p>to do with her giving him the gift? When Amane had given Mahiru the teddy bear, he,
        <p></p>too, had felt like running away, and it'd been difficult for him to calm down. Maybe
        <p></p>Mahiru was experiencing a similar sort of anxiety.
        <p></p>"By the way, can I open this?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"P-please do."
        <p></p>Amane picked up the gift from where he'd left it sitting atop the coffee table, and
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded somewhat hesitantly. Concluding that she was indeed nervous about
        <p></p>giving him a present, Amane untied the ribbon fastening the bag.
        <p></p>Right away, he could tell from the feel and weight that it was something made out of
        <p></p>cloth. When Amane pulled it out and saw it to be a length of black-and-white
        <p></p>houndstooth, he wasn't sure what it was. After spreading out the whole object,
        <p></p>however, he immediately understood.
        <p></p>"A scarf?"
        <p></p>It appeared to be quite soft and luxurious. Surely, this would keep him warm if he
        <p></p>wound it around his neck.
        <p></p>"…Well, you're indifferent to fashion, and you always seem cold on the way to school,
        <p></p>so…"
        <p></p>"I can really use it; and wow, it feels so nice."
        <p></p>"Quality is important when you're choosing something that you'll be using every day,"
        <p></p>Mahiru explained.
        <p></p>As Mahiru was someone who only wore high-quality clothes, Amane was sure she
        <p></p>knew what she was talking about. Mahiru seemed like the type who considered it a
        <p></p>waste of time to buy cheap things, preferring to use well-made products that would
        <p></p>last for a long time, instead. If this scarf met her standards, it had to be very nice
        <p></p>indeed.
        <p></p>Amane could tell just by touching it that the scarf had a luxurious texture and was soft
        <p></p>enough not to bother even sensitive skin.
        <p></p>Impressed with Mahiru's high standards, Amane waved the gift at her while she
        <p></p>watched him with a stiff expression.
        <p></p>"Can I try it on?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"I gave it to you, so you can do whatever you like," Mahiru answered curtly.
        <p></p>"Roger."
        <p></p>Amane smiled at her blunt response and wrapped the scarf around himself. He could
        <p></p>feel the quality of the fabric even more on his neck, where the skin was more sensitive.
        <p></p>It kept all the warmth in without letting too much air pass through. The feel of the
        <p></p>fabric was soothing and snug. As Amane was still inside, it was hard to tell just how
        <p></p>effective the scarf would be, but he trusted it would undoubtedly keep him comfortable
        <p></p>throughout the winter months.
        <p></p>"Wow, it's super warm."
        <p></p>"That's great."
        <p></p>Amane put on a gentle smile, and Mahiru answered with a relieved smile of her own.
        <p></p>Recently, Mahiru had begun to show Amane her many kinds of smiles more frequently,
        <p></p>and he found himself staring again at her enchanting features.
        <p></p>…When she looks like that, she really does seem like an angel…
        <p></p>Sure, everyone at school said Mahiru looked heavenly, but Amane thought it was far
        <p></p>more attractive when she smiled like this and showed her true self.
        <p></p>"Wh-what is it?" Mahiru had noticed that Amane was staring straight at her. Her eyes
        <p></p>shifted left and right before fixing themselves back on the one gazing at her.
        <p></p>"Nothing; I was just thinking that you seem much more relaxed compared to when I
        <p></p>first met you."
        <p></p>"…Is that so?"
        <p></p>Mahiru looked surprised, and Amane laughed a little.
        <p></p>"Yeah. Before, you were all stuck-up and not cute at all."
        <p></p>"That was terrible of me, not being cute," Mahiru said sarcastically.
        <p></p>"Come on—don't sulk… Now you're way more… How should I put it? I think you just
        <p></p>look better. I was thinking that the way you smile now is way cuter. It's really kind of
        <p></p>a shame you weren't smiling like that sooner."
        <p></p>Mahiru had always been beautiful, but some quality of that changed in how she carried
        <p></p>herself.
        <p></p>The angelic smile that she showed at school had the beauty of something to be
        <p></p>appreciated from a distance. It was a fragile thing that was not be touched.
        <p></p>The cold look that she'd first given Amane held the appeal of something wreathed in
        <p></p>thorns to keep humans from getting too close.
        <p></p>Now her soft and innocent smile had a welcoming warmth that made Amane want to
        <p></p>caress and cherish her.
        <p></p>Amane thought about how Mahiru had changed. She'd slowly gotten used to being
        <p></p>around him, and she'd slowly opened up her heart. As he thought back on the time
        <p></p>they'd spent together, Amane felt a ticklish sensation gradually rising through his
        <p></p>chest and up into his cheeks.
        <p></p>"I'm happy that you can smile so naturally now, and that you've gotten used to hanging
        <p></p>around with me, and… What are you doing?"
        <p></p>Amane's sentence was physically cut off as Mahiru lifted the scarf up from around his
        <p></p>neck to cover his face with the fabric. She didn't wrap it tight, but it grew a bit stuffy
        <p></p>and hot as the material trapped Amane's breath.
        <p></p>"…Please just be quiet for a bit," Mahiru commanded.
        <p></p>"What for?"
        <p></p>"…Nothing."
        <p></p>Amane didn't understand this sudden outburst of eccentric behavior. He grabbed the
        <p></p>wrist of her hand that was holding up the scarf and pushed it back down. With his
        <p></p>vision restored, he could see Mahiru's flaxen hair and the tinge of color spread across
        <p></p>her cheeks, and he noticed that she was trembling slightly. As she looked at him, she
        <p></p>grew even more flushed.
        <p></p>He wondered why she was making such an odd face, and then it suddenly hit him that
        <p></p>there could be only one answer.
        <p></p>"…Don't tell me… you're embarrassed?"
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>Mahiru turned away sharply, which only served to confirm what Amane had said.
        <p></p>Without meaning to, Amane smiled as he mused that the angel sure could be prickly
        <p></p>about things like this.
        <p></p>Mahiru groaned and quietly muttered, "I'm going outside for some air." Then she
        <p></p>quickly made for the veranda.
        <p></p>Through the window, Amane could see it snowing just like it had the day before, but
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem to care and stepped out onto the balcony anyway.
        <p></p>Chilly air rushed into the apartment, and Amane shivered. Though Mahiru immediately
        <p></p>shut the door, a touch of cold still hung about the living room. Amane let out a quiet
        <p></p>sigh.
        <p></p>It's fine for her to run away to hide her embarrassment, but she could at least do it in a
        <p></p>slightly warmer outfit.
        <p></p>Mahiru had obviously picked her clothes assuming she would be spending the day
        <p></p>inside—or at least wearing a heavy jacket if she went out. She'd clearly prioritized
        <p></p>looks over warmth, and her slender body was sure to chill quickly in the cold.
        <p></p>Amane cursed under his breath and picked up the blanket that was lying over the back
        <p></p>of the sofa.
        <p></p>It's super dangerous to stand outside in the snow wearing such thin clothing.
        <p></p>After pulling on his coat, Amane followed Mahiru out onto the veranda and wrapped
        <p></p>the blanket around her shoulders.
        <p></p>"Getting some fresh air is fine, but you'll catch a cold like that," chided Amane.
        <p></p>Mahiru quickly turned to face him. "…Isn't that my line?" Clearly, she'd calmed down,
        <p></p>as she'd answered with her usual demeanor and expression, though there was a bit of
        <p></p>a sulking tone to her voice. Maybe she was feeling down because Amane had said
        <p></p>something that called back to the conversation from when they'd first met.
        <p></p>"Hmph. That only happened because I didn't get in a bath and warm up like I should
        <p></p>have. Simple negligence," Amane reminded.
        <p></p>"Next time you get soaked like a drowned rat, make sure you warm yourself up right.
        <p></p>If I'm there, I'll be sure to toss you in the bath myself," Mahiru shot back.
        <p></p>"What're you, my mom?"
        <p></p>There were definitely times when Mahiru said some rather motherly things.
        <p></p>With a smile, Amane recalled his first encounter with the angel. It'd been around the
        <p></p>time autumn usually started getting cold, about halfway through October. He hadn't
        <p></p>expected to come down with a fever just from getting a little wet, but the weather had
        <p></p>gotten chillier far faster than it usually did back in his hometown. Thinking back on it,
        <p></p>Amane admitted to himself that perhaps he really had been careless.
        <p></p>The most surprising part of the whole situation, however, had definitely been Mahiru
        <p></p>nursing him back to health.
        <p></p>"…Y'know, it's already been two months since we started talking…," Amane said
        <p></p>wistfully.
        <p></p>"You're right. And to think, your room was so dirty! It was terrible… Now it only haunts
        <p></p>my memories," Mahiru quipped.
        <p></p>"Oh, hush. I'm keeping it clean now, right?"
        <p></p>"And who do you owe for that?"
        <p></p>"Why, Lady Mahiru, of course. It makes me want to bow down in humble gratitude."
        <p></p>"You don't need to do that, geez."
        <p></p>Back on that rainy day, Amane would never have believed that he and Mahiru would
        <p></p>get to a point where they could banter like this. It all seemed so long ago now, but
        <p></p>really, it had only been a short while back. A lot had changed in those two months.
        <p></p>Time had really flown by.
        <p></p>A silence fell over the two, and suddenly, everything was quiet.
        <p></p>The snow, which had been starting and stopping in fits since yesterday, was now
        <p></p>drifting softly down from the sky, painting the surrounding apartment buildings in a
        <p></p>pale hue.
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru's building was in residential area, plus it was Christmas, so the
        <p></p>area was hushed. From some apartment nearby, the pair could very faintly hear the
        <p></p>sounds of a Christmas song, though not well enough to decipher any lyrics.
        <p></p>Mahiru exhaled a little white puff, and Amane's ears caught that sound better than any
        <p></p>other.
        <p></p>"…It's kind of a strange feeling." Mahiru was the one to break the silence. "At first, I was
        <p></p>wondering 'What's up with this guy?'"
        <p></p>"Well, I guess that's not surprising. Anyone would be suspicious if someone suddenly
        <p></p>forced an umbrella on them… What do you think now?"
        <p></p>"Hmm, let's see. I'd have to say… you're a whole lot of work." Mahiru turned away after
        <p></p>her ambiguous answer.
        <p></p>"You're not wrong." Amane smiled while leaning against the veranda railing. "…You
        <p></p>know, I never thought that we would get close enough to be eating meals together like
        <p></p>this, either. To be honest, I always thought of you as someone to be admired from a
        <p></p>distance. I never considered ever getting involved with you."
        <p></p>"That was certainly honest… though I knew that already. That's precisely why I trust
        <p></p>you," Mahiru said, and her body shook with laughter.
        <p></p>Amane knew that Mahiru only accepted him in her life because he wasn't attracted to
        <p></p>her; and apparently, she felt the same way.
        <p></p>"Still, I'm glad that I got to know you like this. My life has really improved a ton, I'm
        <p></p>happy because I get to eat delicious food every day, and I feel at ease when I'm hanging
        <p></p>out with you," Amane declared.
        <p></p>"…You really think so?"
        <p></p>"I do. I'm incredibly grateful for these past two months. Thank you." Amane couldn't
        <p></p>have been more sincere if he tried. It was thanks to Mahiru that his standard of living
        <p></p>had gone up and that he got to enjoy a delicious meal every day. Surprisingly, Amane
        <p></p>had also discovered that he could enjoy talking to a girl without any sort of awkward
        <p></p>expectations. It'd even become something he looked forward to. Even better, Mahiru
        <p></p>would occasionally flash him adorable reactions when Amane teased her, and he never
        <p></p>got tired of those.
        <p></p>Recently, she's started to laugh more, too.
        <p></p>As Amane had realized before, Mahiru had indeed started displaying a richer array of
        <p></p>emotions, a change that only made her more endearing. Amane would never actually
        <p></p>act on his feelings, of course, but… just looking at her made him feel at peace.
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes were wide, and Amane couldn't tell whether the slight redness in her
        <p></p>cheeks was because of the cold or because she was embarrassed.
        <p></p>"No, thank you very much," she said.
        <p></p>"But I didn't do anything." From Amane's perspective, Mahiru was the one who'd done
        <p></p>everything for him. He was sure he hadn't given the girl anything in return, but she
        <p></p>slowly shook her head in disagreement.
        <p></p>"…I'm grateful for things that you aren't aware of, Amane," Mahiru explained.
        <p></p>"Hmm… Each of us telling the other what we're thankful for has sort of an end-of-theyear vibe. I guess that's not all that weird, since the year is about to end."
        <p></p>Curiously, both Amane and Mahiru had thanked the other for certain things, despite
        <p></p>the new year still being six days away.
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes sparkled at the mention of the end of the year, and she let a little laugh
        <p></p>slip out. "Ha-ha, that's right. It's still a little early, but… Happy New Year, Amane. Let's
        <p></p>make it a good one."
        <p></p>"…Yeah, Happy New Year." Amane nodded and smiled at Mahiru's heaven-sent proposal.
        <p></p>Then Mahiru suddenly said, "I'm freezing; let's go on inside, shall we?" She turned
        <p></p>around and opened the glass door that led back to Amane's living room.
        <p></p>Amane caught a glimpse of her ears, which had turned bright red in the frosty air, and
        <p></p>he agreed that it was best to retreat inside so as not to catch cold.
        <p></p>…One way or another, I guess I've also taken a liking to this lifestyle. That's probably why
        <p></p>my chest feels so warm. As he followed Mahiru back into the apartment, Amane
        <p></p>watched the gentle swaying of her soft, flaxen hair and smiled secretly to himself.
        <p></p>He hoped that in the days to come, he would continue to see more of the angel who
        <p></p>lived next door.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 15: A Power Outage, Anxiety, and Warmth 
        <p></p>"Ah!"
        <p></p>Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness.
        <p></p>The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front,
        <p></p>and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane
        <p></p>hadn't expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power.
        <p></p>After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs
        <p></p>to the television. It was a total blackout.
        <p></p>Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn't suffered any damage, but
        <p></p>he would have to check the other appliances later.
        <p></p>"Do you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom."
        <p></p>He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately,
        <p></p>Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been
        <p></p>sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out.
        <p></p>However, there was no reply.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru?" he called out anxiously.
        <p></p>Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and
        <p></p>still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been
        <p></p>sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru's
        <p></p>arm… It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away.
        <p></p>There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling
        <p></p>voice come from the floor.
        <p></p>"What a disgrace…"
        <p></p>"…Um, sorry I startled you."
        <p></p>"…No. I startled myself; that's all."
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped
        <p></p>around and found her original position.
        <p></p>Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn't seem to be
        <p></p>in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane's shirt
        <p></p>again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly.
        <p></p>It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling
        <p></p>again. This time, she didn't fall off the sofa.
        <p></p>"Looking for something?"
        <p></p>"…Are you being sarcastic?"
        <p></p>"Why in the world would I be?"
        <p></p>"I thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout…"
        <p></p>"I'm not that much of an ass."
        <p></p>Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily—but she was
        <p></p>still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out.
        <p></p>Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but
        <p></p>inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with
        <p></p>the hem of Amane's shirt, but she didn't make any moves to brush off his hand. He had
        <p></p>been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand.
        <p></p>"…So I guess you're not a big fan of the dark?"
        <p></p>He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head.
        <p></p>"…I don't hate it, but…"
        <p></p>"Mm-hmm?"
        <p></p>"…I just don't like it when it's bright one moment and dark the next—that's all."
        <p></p>"Ah, okay."
        <p></p>"I'm not really afraid of the dark, and I don't feel scared."
        <p></p>"Sure, yeah."
        <p></p>Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but
        <p></p>Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff.
        <p></p>He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but
        <p></p>Mahiru added in a small voice, "…There's just one thing."
        <p></p>He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. "Hmm?"
        <p></p>"…When we sit like this, I know I'm not alone, and I feel better," Mahiru mumbled. She
        <p></p>sounded relieved.
        <p></p>"I see," said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again.
        <p></p>"…The power's back on. I'm going to check my appliances."
        <p></p>The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of
        <p></p>Amane's hold and stood up.
        <p></p>Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears
        <p></p>poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything.
        <p></p>He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had
        <p></p>malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small "Thank you" and couldn't
        <p></p>help but stare at her.
        <p></p>In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape. Amane
        <p></p>simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers
        <p></p>there.
        <p></p>Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks.
        <p></p>"That's weird," he muttered as he turned away bashfully
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 16: Spending the End of the Year with the Angel 
        <p></p>Once Christmas had passed, the whole world could feel the end of the year approaching.
        <p></p>The day after spending Christmas with Mahiru, Amane went out to do a bit of shopping
        <p></p>on his own. By the time he was finished, his surroundings had undergone a dramatic
        <p></p>shift, and Amane admired the new scenery on his way home.
        <p></p>The lights strung up around the city remained, but the ornamented trees and Christmas
        <p></p>decorations had already been replaced with more traditional Japanese adornments.
        <p></p>The shops had also updated their merchandise, selling New Year's decorations and
        <p></p>foods. If there were any Christmas things still in stock, at best they had been reduced
        <p></p>in price and were displayed under INVENTORY CLEAR-OUT SALE labels.
        <p></p>Amane nestled his face deeper into the billowy folds of his scarf as he pondered the
        <p></p>sudden changeover. Mahiru had given him the monochrome houndstooth-patterned
        <p></p>scarf as a Christmas present. It was both practical and tasteful; it looked stylish and
        <p></p>felt very nice to the touch, and most importantly, it kept the chilly winter winds at bay.
        <p></p>Amane had never really worn a scarf before, so he was feeling grateful for this one as
        <p></p>he checked over the contents of the shopping bags hanging from his arms.
        <p></p>Though the two of them were supposed to share this responsibility—in order to
        <p></p>reduce the burden on Mahiru, who did all the cooking—Amane usually went out to
        <p></p>buy the ingredients, armed with a shopping list.
        <p></p>It was a cold day, and Amane's bags were stuffed with vegetables and mushrooms and
        <p></p>meat—Mahiru must have been planning to make a hot pot. The plentiful vegetables
        <p></p>were her way of wordlessly insisting that Amane eat a more balanced, nutritious diet.
        <p></p>He laughed quietly to himself, amused that Mahiru was somehow still looking out for
        <p></p>him even when she wasn't actually present.
        <p></p>He checked again to be sure that he'd gotten everything, then quickly returned home,
        <p></p>shivering against the relentless cold.
        <p></p>"Welcome back."
        <p></p>It was already evening when Amane entered his apartment, and Mahiru was there to
        <p></p>greet him.
        <p></p>It was kind of a strange feeling, being welcomed into his own apartment, but recently
        <p></p>he had gotten used to it.
        <p></p>"Mm, I'm back… I bought some thinly sliced mochi; I hope that's okay?"
        <p></p>"You want to cook it in the hot pot, right?"
        <p></p>"Yeah. I also got some ramen to finish off the meal."
        <p></p>"…There's no way I can eat that much, you know."
        <p></p>"Don't worry, I'll make sure it doesn't go to waste."
        <p></p>Amane had never been the type to eat huge meals before, but now, thanks to Mahiru's
        <p></p>cooking, he had started enjoying more sizable dinners. In fact, he found his new
        <p></p>portion sizes a bit concerning and had resolved to start weight training.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to be watching her diet as well. She rarely prepared any fattening
        <p></p>foods. On the other hand, she also seemed to think that Amane could stand to put on
        <p></p>a bit of weight, since he was so slim. Amane hoped he would add muscle and not fat.
        <p></p>"Well, if you're going to finish it, then that's fine. Here, give me the bags. I'll put the
        <p></p>things in the fridge. You go wash your hands."
        <p></p>"I know, I know."
        <p></p>Amane handed the full shopping bags to Mahiru and obediently headed for the sink.
        <p></p>"Come to think of it, what are you doing for New Year's, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>After finishing every last bite of the day's delicious meal, as always, Amane suddenly
        <p></p>asked Mahiru the question that had been weighing on his mind.
        <p></p>"New Year's… Well, there's no point in going home, so I'll be here."
        <p></p>He realized his blunder when he heard her indifferent tone, but Mahiru didn't actually
        <p></p>seem all that bothered.
        <p></p>Her relationship with her parents wasn't good, so she always had a cold attitude
        <p></p>whenever the conversation turned to her family.
        <p></p>But if that's the case, won't Mahiru be spending the holiday alone?
        <p></p>Amane had his standing promise to show his face at home once every six months, so
        <p></p>he had been planning to visit during the long break—that was before he had met
        <p></p>Mahiru.
        <p></p>"You're going back home, right, Amane?"
        <p></p>"That's right; I'm pretty much under orders to show up."
        <p></p>He glanced over at her and saw that the expression in her eyes was somewhat chillier
        <p></p>than usual. She seemed to have resolved herself to spending the holiday alone, what
        <p></p>with Amane going away and all.
        <p></p>"…Man, when I get home, I'm gonna get absolutely grilled about you."
        <p></p>"How terrible…"
        <p></p>"I can probably get by with just giving my dad the basics, but my mom is going to want
        <p></p>to hear a whole lot more."
        <p></p>"That's awfully strange, since I talk to her all the time."
        <p></p>"You really got familiar with my mom in no time…"
        <p></p>For some reason, Mahiru had made fast friends with Amane's mother and, without
        <p></p>him noticing, had been sending her photos and private stories… which frankly killed
        <p></p>him a little inside. But Mahiru obviously enjoyed it, so Amane didn't see any harm in
        <p></p>it. He only hoped she wasn't telling his mother anything more than she absolutely
        <p></p>needed to know.
        <p></p>Recalling the distant, lonely expression that crossed Mahiru's face from time to time,
        <p></p>Amane decided that he didn't want to leave her here alone.
        <p></p>"Well, I did just see Mom a little while ago… I would miss seeing Dad, but I wonder if
        <p></p>it would be all right if I didn't go home for the New Year… Besides, I'm supposed to go
        <p></p>back during spring vacation anyway."
        <p></p>Amane was thinking that if he stayed here for the holiday, they could continue having
        <p></p>dinner together like always… that is, if it wasn't too much of an imposition on Mahiru.
        <p></p>"…Oh?"
        <p></p>"Mm. Plus, I want to eat your New Year's noodles."
        <p></p>"What a glutton you are."
        <p></p>"It's all because of your cooking."
        <p></p>"…Even when it's ready-made?"
        <p></p>"That's right."
        <p></p>Even if she only boiled the prepackaged soba noodles, Amane was sure he would still
        <p></p>enjoy them. Because the important thing about their shared meals was the time they
        <p></p>spent together.
        <p></p>"…You're an awfully strange person," Mahiru remarked.
        <p></p>"Oh, hush."
        <p></p>He saw her smile slightly.
        <p></p>"…Thank you."
        <p></p>"What for?"
        <p></p>"For whatever."
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't say anything further, but her expression brightened somewhat, and she
        <p></p>squeezed her favorite cushion.
        <p></p>And then December 31 arrived. New Year's Eve was bringing the year to a close. For
        <p></p>many, it was a busy day, spent cleaning and preparing for the year to come, but—
        <p></p>"Um, hey, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"What is it?"
        <p></p>"…Are you sure you don't want me to help with anything?"
        <p></p>From his position sitting comfortably on the living room couch, Amane was gazing at
        <p></p>Mahiru's back as she was standing apron-clad in his kitchen. She had been in there
        <p></p>since that morning, making osechi, the traditional fare for the New Year holiday.
        <p></p>Since they had decided to ring in the New Year together, naturally they needed enough
        <p></p>to feed two.
        <p></p>Amane had assumed they would be purchasing it premade, but apparently Mahiru
        <p></p>intended to make it all by hand. That would have been quite a task even for a skilled
        <p></p>homemaker, so it was surprising for even this brilliant high school girl to tackle it all
        <p></p>alone.
        <p></p>Amane was seriously impressed, but Mahiru had said, "Well, there's no way we can get
        <p></p>osechi from a store now. You have to order it well in advance."
        <p></p>Admittedly, she was absolutely right, but even so, Amane admired Mahiru for deciding
        <p></p>to make everything herself.
        <p></p>Of course, she took shortcuts where she could. For instance, boiling their own black
        <p></p>soybeans would be very time-consuming and keep one burner occupied for far too
        <p></p>long, so they had bought some prepared soybeans instead.
        <p></p>"Amane, you seem uncomfortable whenever I say you don't have to do anything, but
        <p></p>do you have any idea how you might go about helping me?"
        <p></p>"Honestly, no clue."
        <p></p>"I thought so. It's easier if you just stay out of the way."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't really argue with Mahiru's harsh assessment, so he tried to sit quietly
        <p></p>on the sofa, but he found it impossible to settle down and do nothing.
        <p></p>It wasn't that Amane hadn't done anything at all—he'd finished cleaning his apartment
        <p></p>the day before, and earlier he'd gone on a big shopping run, picking up ingredients for
        <p></p>the osechi dishes along with enough food so that they wouldn't have to go out for a
        <p></p>while. He had taken care of the more physical tasks, but at the moment, Mahiru was
        <p></p>busy, and he wasn't doing much.
        <p></p>"You must be tired from moving all the furniture and appliances yesterday to clean, so
        <p></p>please, just take it easy," Mahiru said without turning around, though Amane thought
        <p></p>he heard a note of concern in her voice.
        <p></p>It appeared that Mahiru had already finished her own New Year's cleaning. Apparently,
        <p></p>it hadn't taken much work at all since she always kept her place so tidy.
        <p></p>So that's the difference between someone who makes a habit of keeping things clean and
        <p></p>someone who doesn't, Amane mused. Guess I should've realized that earlier…
        <p></p>"Well, even so, I feel bad about it."
        <p></p>"I really like cooking, so it's no trouble."
        <p></p>"Still…"
        <p></p>"It's fine; I'm having fun."
        <p></p>Amane was at a loss for how to react to Mahiru, who brushed him off, fully absorbed
        <p></p>in her work.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, I went ahead and bought lunch."
        <p></p>It would have been unfair to expect Mahiru to prepare lunch when she had her hands
        <p></p>full with the osechi, so Amane had gone to the convenience store. He'd figured there
        <p></p>would be no problem with a simple meal of sandwiches, since Mahiru didn't eat that
        <p></p>much anyway.
        <p></p>Mahiru had already taken off her apron. She must have been planning to take a break,
        <p></p>so the timing seemed just about perfect.
        <p></p>"Thanks for going to the trouble," Mahiru said as she stepped into the living room. Her
        <p></p>break would double as lunchtime. "I'm really sorry for not getting around to making
        <p></p>lunch."
        <p></p>"Come on, I'm definitely the one who should be apologizing, with you making all that
        <p></p>osechi. Here, let's eat. How's a sandwich and cafe au lait sound?"
        <p></p>"That's fine, thank you," Mahiru said as she accepted the food, then took a seat beside
        <p></p>him on the couch.
        <p></p>"So about how much have you gotten done so far?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Well, I'm using a lot of premade ingredients, and I'm trying not to limit the number
        <p></p>of dishes, so… I'd say I'm nearly finished. After this, there are a lot of things that need
        <p></p>to rest or chill in the fridge. You seem to like sweet rolled omelets, Amane, so I made
        <p></p>those by hand."
        <p></p>"How did you know?"
        <p></p>"You like all the other egg dishes I make. I didn't think that rolled omelets would be
        <p></p>the exception."
        <p></p>He surmised that she had cooked them specially in the oven. He had heard it humming
        <p></p>earlier and wondered what she was making.
        <p></p>"You like the ones that are slightly sweet, right?"
        <p></p>"You know me too well."
        <p></p>"It's not surprising that I would learn your tastes after several months," Mahiru said
        <p></p>as she bit into her ham and lettuce sandwich. It made him very happy to hear that.
        <p></p>As Amane started eating the rice ball he had bought for himself, he looked over into
        <p></p>the kitchen. His eyes landed on the smallish multitiered food boxes that Mahiru had
        <p></p>brought over with her.
        <p></p>She must be planning to pack the food into those boxes.
        <p></p>He hadn't expected her to go so far as to bring out the special boxes for all the food—
        <p></p>after all, she lived alone, just like him—so he had been a little shocked to see the fancylooking containers all painted with lacquer and decorated with gold leaf.
        <p></p>"Seriously, I can't thank you enough. How do I put this…? This past year, I've gotten to
        <p></p>enjoy food in a way I never could have imagined when I first started living alone."
        <p></p>"And here I thought you were doing just fine on your own."
        <p></p>"Rude. You know better than anyone how I was surviving off convenience store meals."
        <p></p>"It certainly wasn't healthy. That's for sure." Mahiru let out an exasperated sigh, but
        <p></p>she also wore a knowing smile, which caught Amane by surprise. "Well, now that I'm
        <p></p>here," she added, "I won't let you fall back into your old unhealthy habits, all right?"
        <p></p>"Who are you, my mom?"
        <p></p>"It's your own fault for living like that. Next year you're really going to learn how to
        <p></p>eat properly. Do I make myself clear?" Mahiru's eyes shone with sudden enthusiasm.
        <p></p>Amane realized that she had just announced her intention to spend the coming year
        <p></p>with him as well. The thought made him feel terribly self-conscious, and he found
        <p></p>himself looking away.
        <p></p>However, Mahiru must have interpreted that gesture as a reluctance to give up his
        <p></p>slothful ways because she promptly scowled at Amane, who found himself struggling
        <p></p>to awkwardly explain himself.
        <p></p>Mahiru finished making and packing up all the osechi dishes by around sunset and
        <p></p>then set about preparing the New Year's noodles, which just entailed boiling the
        <p></p>noodles and readying the toppings, since they had bought precut raw noodles.
        <p></p>She had some kamaboko fish cake left over from the osechi, so that was a perfect
        <p></p>addition. All there was left to do was parboil the spinach and slice the green onion.
        <p></p>The most labor-intensive part was the shrimp tempura, but Mahiru seemed to be
        <p></p>having no trouble as she fried them all up.
        <p></p>"I also had some kabocha left over, so I'm going to fry that while I'm at it."
        <p></p>"Man… these are gonna be some serious New Year's noodles."
        <p></p>"Sometimes it's fun to make stuff like this," Mahiru said as she finished serving up the
        <p></p>noodles. They looked far more splendid than anything most people would normally
        <p></p>eat at home.
        <p></p>She had made two large pieces of shrimp tempura per bowl, and the bonus kabocha
        <p></p>tempura was crisped to perfection. There was plenty of spinach and green onion, and
        <p></p>the kamaboko fish cake was cut into a decorative fan shape.
        <p></p>Amane noticed that Mahiru liked to keep her tempura crispy, as both of their portions
        <p></p>had been placed on separate plates rather than directly in the bowl with the noodles.
        <p></p>He was grateful for this small, thoughtful act.
        <p></p>"Wow!"
        <p></p>"Please, eat up."
        <p></p>Perhaps concerned that the noodles wouldn't be enough to satisfy Amane's appetite,
        <p></p>Mahiru had also served all the leftover bits from the osechi dishes on a small plate.
        <p></p>Amane watched Mahiru take her seat, then they both pressed their hands together to
        <p></p>give thanks for the food before digging into their noodles.
        <p></p>Even though Mahiru had said that the soba had come premade, she must have picked
        <p></p>out high-quality noodles. Amane could smell the rich fragrance of buckwheat with
        <p></p>every bite. The broth wasn't too thick or too thin, and it was seasoned so well he sighed
        <p></p>with delight. It warmed him from the depths of his belly. The perfect dish for a cold
        <p></p>day.
        <p></p>"Ah… now this is what the end of the year should feel like…"
        <p></p>He took a sip of broth and sighed… mumbling quietly to himself.
        <p></p>He was certainly enjoying the chance to sit back and watch TV while eating his
        <p></p>noodles, awaiting the arrival of the New Year.
        <p></p>It was also his family's custom every year to eat New Year's noodles and spend New
        <p></p>Year's Eve watching the year-end musical specials on television, so Amane was glad
        <p></p>that he could keep the tradition going.
        <p></p>But tonight he was not sitting with his family—instead, there was a beautiful girl
        <p></p>beside him.
        <p></p>"When you eat New Year's noodles, it hits you all at once that the year's really ending,
        <p></p>doesn't it?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"I know what you mean…," Amane replied. "So much happened this year."
        <p></p>Of course, he was mostly talking about his burgeoning relationship with Mahiru.
        <p></p>When he'd first started living alone, he couldn't possibly have imagined such a
        <p></p>beautiful girl fixing him such delicious meals.
        <p></p>"Oh, because this was the year you started living alone, right, Amane? That must have
        <p></p>been difficult."
        <p></p>"You, on the other hand, never seem to have any trouble, do you?"
        <p></p>"Well, that's because I can more or less do everything for myself. It's a disaster for
        <p></p>someone like you, trying to live on your own even though you don't know how to do
        <p></p>anything."
        <p></p>"Uh… that's true, but…"
        <p></p>"You really are the definition of hopeless, aren't you?"
        <p></p>The expression on Mahiru's face was gentle as she scolded him, more charming than
        <p></p>exasperated. She didn't seem burdened by taking care of Amane. She just looked…
        <p></p>content.
        <p></p>"…I owe you for everything you've done this year."
        <p></p>He repeated the words of thanks that he had said to her on Christmas, and Mahiru
        <p></p>smiled slightly.
        <p></p>"And don't you ever forget it."
        <p></p>Her quick and unconditional agreement prickled slightly in his chest, but his saving
        <p></p>grace was that Mahiru clearly didn't mean anything.
        <p></p>"…I hope you'll help me out next year, too."
        <p></p>"I know I'll need to. If I wasn't around, you'd barrel headlong into an unhealthy and
        <p></p>slovenly lifestyle again in no time."
        <p></p>"I can't deny that."
        <p></p>"…If you're aware of it, then you ought to do better…"
        <p></p>"I'll aspire to do so in the coming year."
        <p></p>Even if he did put his mind to it, Amane had a feeling that Mahiru's constant caretaking
        <p></p>would quickly erode any desire to fend for himself. Of course, he couldn't say that out
        <p></p>loud, so he pushed the thought to the back of his mind.
        <p></p>He'd do his best to keep his place tidy, but there was no doubt that he would still be
        <p></p>depending on her for meals. He had become entirely domesticated, and the fact that
        <p></p>he was painfully aware of this development didn't make it any less true. Plus, Mahiru
        <p></p>always laughed at him whenever he said he was going to try to improve himself.
        <p></p>Amane made a sour face, but Mahiru just smiled slightly, as if she was savoring the
        <p></p>moment.
        <p></p>"The New Year's almost upon us."
        <p></p>"Looks like it."
        <p></p>They had finished eating their New Year's noodles and sat on the sofa watching the
        <p></p>annual end-of-the-year musical showcase on television. Before either of them realized
        <p></p>it, the new day—and the New Year—was just moments away.
        <p></p>Time had passed much faster than Amane had expected while he was occupied
        <p></p>watching Mahiru quietly enjoy the show. Apparently, she wasn't very familiar with
        <p></p>current pop music, possibly because she didn't watch much TV in general.
        <p></p>The screen switched over to a scene of a temple bell—a clear sign the year was about
        <p></p>to end. The great bell began ringing. Seated next to him, Mahiru quietly listened to the
        <p></p>chimes, eyes lowered.
        <p></p>As the bell rang the one hundred and seventh time—
        <p></p>The instant that the new day began, Mahiru turned to him, sat up properly, and bowed.
        <p></p>"Happy New Year," she said.
        <p></p>Caught up in the moment, Amane also straightened up and gave her the same formal
        <p></p>New Year's greeting. "Happy New Year… It feels kind of strange, huh? Spending it
        <p></p>together."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, I suppose it does," Mahiru replied. "I hope you'll look after me this year as
        <p></p>well."
        <p></p>"Of course… Though, it feels like I should really be the one asking you that, eh?"
        <p></p>"I can't argue with that."
        <p></p>Mahiru let out a giggle, and Amane shot her a slightly awkward grin. Then the
        <p></p>smartphone he had on his lap began to vibrate. His messaging app had several
        <p></p>notifications—New Year's greetings had come in from Itsuki and Chitose.
        <p></p>Mahiru's phone also vibrated. She had only just met his friends and hadn't exchanged
        <p></p>contact info with Chitose yet, so she must have been getting messages from a friend
        <p></p>Amane didn't know.
        <p></p>In recent years, the convenience of sending New Year's greetings via phone message
        <p></p>had become really popular.
        <p></p>"I'm just going to reply to this."
        <p></p>"Same."
        <p></p>Amane figured that Mahiru had probably received a lot of messages. Yet somehow he
        <p></p>also had the feeling that she wasn't in the habit of giving boys her contact information.
        <p></p>Amane watched Mahiru's practiced fingers flit deftly across her phone as she typed
        <p></p>out her responses. "It's times like these that you finally seem like a regular high school
        <p></p>girl," he remarked before checking his own phone.
        <p></p>The messages from Itsuki and Chitose were the bog-standard 'Happy New Year'
        <p></p>followed by needless prying. "Did you spend the New Year holiday getting friendly with
        <p></p>Lady Shiina?" As usual, Itsuki was disconcertingly perceptive.
        <p></p>Amane sent a reply denying it.
        <p></p>Immediately, he got a mocking response from Itsuki, accusing him of lying. For a while,
        <p></p>the two friends carried on a lively text conversation. Itsuki would make certain
        <p></p>allegations that Amane would deny every time, and then… he felt a weight flop down
        <p></p>against his upper arm.
        <p></p>A sweet fragrance wafted over him.
        <p></p>The sudden contact startled him. He glanced timidly to the side, not believing it could
        <p></p>be true… only to confirm that Mahiru was indeed leaning against him, fast asleep.
        <p></p>—Wait, wait, wait!
        <p></p>Amane didn't say anything out loud, but he was already beginning to panic on the
        <p></p>inside.
        <p></p>Mahiru had dozed off at his place before, but who could have ever imagined that she
        <p></p>would do so here and now, right beside him, pressed up against his shoulder?
        <p></p>It was obvious what had happened.
        <p></p>They had stayed up quite late, past twelve thirty AM. Mahiru, who observed a strict
        <p></p>routine, probably wasn't used to being awake at this hour. Moreover, she had spent
        <p></p>most of the day bustling about making the osechi dishes and must have been
        <p></p>exhausted, even if she didn't show it on the surface. She simply hadn't had the strength
        <p></p>to fight off the sandman any longer.
        <p></p>Amane completely understood—but to fall asleep now of all times!
        <p></p>Dozing against Amane's shoulder, Mahiru wore a truly peaceful expression, completely
        <p></p>oblivious to his confusion and consternation. Her long eyelashes and cute nose and
        <p></p>pink lips all had a soft vulnerability to them that Amane hadn't noticed before.
        <p></p>It wasn't the first time he'd seen her sleeping face, but he had never observed her from
        <p></p>such close range, and the sight froze him in place.
        <p></p>"Mahiru…," he said hesitantly. "Mahiru, wake up."
        <p></p>There was no response.
        <p></p>Mahiru must have been incredibly tired. It seemed that her fatigue had dragged her
        <p></p>down into the deepest oceans of slumber. He called out to her and nudged her with
        <p></p>his shoulder, but the girl showed no sign of waking.
        <p></p>Even when he tapped her shoulder and gently shook her body, Mahiru didn't stir.
        <p></p>His attempts to rouse her caused her to start pitching forward after slipping off his
        <p></p>arm. In a panic, Amane caught her and pulled her back toward him… which was fine,
        <p></p>but now he found himself embracing her. His alarm only grew.
        <p></p>…Wow, she smells amazing…
        <p></p>After dinner, Mahiru had briefly gone back to her place to freshen up, and the floral
        <p></p>fragrance of her shampoo that mingled with her natural scent was making Amane
        <p></p>tremendously uncomfortable. And he couldn't help but notice how soft she was,
        <p></p>pressed up against him.
        <p></p>Amane was not handling this well.
        <p></p>He had tried to wake her, but she had fallen too deeply asleep, and he was reluctant to
        <p></p>try to rouse her more forcefully.
        <p></p>What should I do?
        <p></p>The New Year had barely started, and Amane was already facing an unbelievable
        <p></p>dilemma.
        <p></p>He looked down at the girl sleeping in his arms with grim determination. She was still
        <p></p>out cold. She must really trust me to drift off like that without a care, Amane realized. It
        <p></p>was enough to make him want to bang his head against the wall in frustration and
        <p></p>embarrassment as his sense of reason began to fail him.
        <p></p>No matter how he tried, his attention kept straying back to the distinct feeling of her
        <p></p>slender body pressed against his. It was firm, but with a feminine softness to it, and
        <p></p>had a particularly intoxicating voluptuousness where their chests met…
        <p></p>—What the heck should I do?
        <p></p>Not only was Amane utterly unprepared for his present situation, the unimaginable
        <p></p>softness brushing against him was quickly wearing away at any remaining composure
        <p></p>he thought he possessed.
        <p></p>This was the first time he had ever realized how soft and supple and nice-smelling
        <p></p>girls could be… and even thinking about how he felt was enough to send his mind
        <p></p>spinning into chaos. It was like one big feedback loop.
        <p></p>Even so, he still felt compelled to do something. He had a feeling that there was not
        <p></p>going to be an easy way out of this one, so Amane tried to clear his mind and steel his
        <p></p>resolve.
        <p></p>At the moment, there were three ways he could think of to approach this.
        <p></p>1. Wake Mahiru forcefully.
        <p></p>2. Carry Mahiru home.
        <p></p>3. Let Mahiru sleep in his own bed—and spend the night on the couch himself.
        <p></p>The first option gave him pause. He didn't like the idea of jostling Mahiru awake when
        <p></p>she was obviously so very tired. What's more, he was the one responsible for wearing
        <p></p>her out, so if it was possible, he wanted to let her rest.
        <p></p>At first glance, option two initially seemed like it would be the least awkward, but he
        <p></p>was really uncomfortable with the idea of searching through Mahiru's pockets for the
        <p></p>key to her apartment and entering a girl's home without permission. He also suspected
        <p></p>that Mahiru would not be too pleased to discover that he'd decided that on his own.
        <p></p>Option three, letting her stay over, was seemed like a safer choice that would be easy
        <p></p>to pull off, but… he was not at all emotionally prepared to have a beautiful girl sleeping
        <p></p>in his bed. It didn't matter how they normally got along. Amane felt like the innocent
        <p></p>charm of her sleeping face was driving him mad.
        <p></p>The thought of such a stunning beauty asleep on his pillow was almost unbearable for
        <p></p>this growing boy. Some of the images that crossed his mind were guilt-inducing.
        <p></p>Still, there was no denying it was the most promising option and the most considerate
        <p></p>compromise that Amane could think of.
        <p></p>He steadied himself for the task, then gently wrapped his hands around Mahiru's back
        <p></p>and under her knees and slowly lifted her.
        <p></p>She was sleeping soundly and was as light as a feather. Of course he would never say
        <p></p>so out loud, but Mahiru felt almost ephemeral in his arms.
        <p></p>He had learned firsthand that she probably wouldn't wake up too easily, but just in
        <p></p>case, Amane tried to keep her as steady as possible while he gingerly carried her to
        <p></p>his room. It took both hands to cradle her, so opening the door proved quite the
        <p></p>challenge, but eventually Amane successfully laid Mahiru on his bed.
        <p></p>Her delicate body sunk into the mattress.
        <p></p>Once Amane had covered her with a blanket and comforter, she was all set up for the
        <p></p>night. He didn't see any indication she was going to wake up, and all he could hear was
        <p></p>her regular, rhythmic breathing. Her face was beautiful as always, but seeing it so
        <p></p>cherubic in sleep was making Amane's heart jump in his chest.
        <p></p>He courteously tucked her in, then crouched down beside the bed.
        <p></p>…It's too much.
        <p></p>Having a girl sleeping in his bed, remembering the soft feeling of her body against his,
        <p></p>seeing her adorable and defenseless sleeping face, then realizing just how much she
        <p></p>must trust him to fall asleep in his apartment—that and a million other things were
        <p></p>running through his mind.
        <p></p>Of course, he was grateful she believed in him, but at the same time, he couldn't help
        <p></p>but think that she only saw him as a safe and hopeless nuisance, a harmless little boy.
        <p></p>Amane glanced over at her and noted the tranquil expression on her sleeping face. She
        <p></p>was utterly oblivious to his inner turmoil.
        <p></p>She has no idea how I feel.
        <p></p>And she's let down her guard too much.
        <p></p>…I could climb into that bed right now if I wanted to…
        <p></p>The thought lasted only a moment before he pushed it out of his mind. Of course it
        <p></p>would be wrong, on so many levels. And he knew that the moment Mahiru woke up
        <p></p>and discovered them sleeping together, she would never talk to him ever again. He
        <p></p>shuddered at the thought of her soft eyes turning cold and scornful.
        <p></p>That is definitely a bad idea.
        <p></p>But maybe, instead of that, if… just a little... would be okay, wouldn't it?
        <p></p>He extended a hand toward Mahiru's head.
        <p></p>Smooth, sleek, glossy—those were the words that came to mind as he slid his fingers
        <p></p>over her long, soft, vibrant hair without hitting a single snag.
        <p></p>She must work hard to keep it like this, huh…?
        <p></p>Feeling both admiration and a shudder of fear at the enormous efforts demanded by
        <p></p>femininity, Amane let his fingertips glide slowly across Mahiru's cheek. Her porcelain
        <p></p>skin was surprisingly cool, at least compared to Amane's fingers. When the brief
        <p></p>caress was over, Amane looked down and saw that a slight smile had graced Mahiru's
        <p></p>tranquil face.
        <p></p>"Good night."
        <p></p>I'm sure she'll be surprised when she wakes up in the morning tomorrow… or actually
        <p></p>today, I guess. Considering what he had just gone through, he figured that she could
        <p></p>live with a little surprise.
        <p></p>I really am hopeless…
        <p></p>Amane flashed a troubled smile, then gently reached out to stroke Mahiru's soft cheek
        <p></p>one more time.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 17: The Defenseless Angel and the Start of the New Year 
        <p></p>When Amane awoke in the morning, all was quiet.
        <p></p>He could hear the cries of birds outside, but there was no sign from his bedroom that
        <p></p>Mahiru was up yet.
        <p></p>It was already past dawn, but maybe because she was exhausted from the night before,
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to still be sleeping soundly.
        <p></p>Amane had only managed to get some brief shut-eye—the persistent thought of
        <p></p>Mahiru in his bed made true rest elusive—and he had ended up drifting off, lingering
        <p></p>on the edge of sleep until deciding to get up.
        <p></p>The restless night wasn't particularly taxing on him physically, so that was fine, but
        <p></p>the whole situation was trying in another way. This was the first time he had ever let
        <p></p>a girl stay over at his place, never mind having one sleep in his bed. Naturally, he was
        <p></p>incredibly anxious.
        <p></p>…I mean, what am I even supposed to do in a situation like this?
        <p></p>He was pretty sure that Mahiru had only allowed herself to fall asleep because she
        <p></p>considered him a safe and harmless guy, but Amane was a guy nonetheless, a fact that
        <p></p>he wished she would acknowledge more often.
        <p></p>He really regretted not waking her and sending her back home, but it was no use now.
        <p></p>Amane sighed and stretched to work out the knots in his body after spending the night
        <p></p>on the sofa, then stood up slowly.
        <p></p>For the time being, he thought he would look in on Mahiru. Well, his main goal was
        <p></p>actually to grab a change of clothes, but he decided to check on her while he was in
        <p></p>there.
        <p></p>Ever so slowly, he opened the bedroom door.
        <p></p>Inside, it was quiet. Mahiru was just as he had left her, still sleeping in his bed.
        <p></p>If there had been any change, it was that she must have turned over several times in
        <p></p>her sleep, because now she was lying on her side, and her hair was spread across the
        <p></p>sheets like a flowing river of gold.
        <p></p>Amane knelt down to look at Mahiru more closely. Her sleeping breaths were even and
        <p></p>serene.
        <p></p>She looks so innocent when she's asleep.
        <p></p>Mahiru often wore a calm expression, perhaps because she usually had her guard up,
        <p></p>but… her sleeping face was the picture of tranquility. Again, he felt the urge to reach
        <p></p>out and pet her.
        <p></p>…She really is cute like this…
        <p></p>Of course, she was undeniably beautiful any time of day, but seeing her in such a
        <p></p>vulnerable state plucked at Amane's heartstrings in a very different way.
        <p></p>He wanted to stroke her smooth hair and poke at her soft cheeks.
        <p></p>She was usually so proper and reserved, with no gaps or cracks in her facade, so
        <p></p>catching her in a defenseless state like this made him want to mess with her a little.
        <p></p>Without putting any thought into the matter, Amane stretched a hand out toward her
        <p></p>and pressed the tip of his finger against her cheek, which looked so soft. Mahiru's skin
        <p></p>was as silky as it had been the night before. He almost wanted to go on touching her
        <p></p>forever. In the back of his mind, he knew he needed to be delicate, but the softness of
        <p></p>her skin was spellbinding and made him want to dote on her…
        <p></p>Mahiru, who had been sleeping quietly, suddenly let out a hoarse but endearing groan
        <p></p>and looked at Amane with bleary, caramel-colored eyes… or at least, she seemed to
        <p></p>look in Amane's direction. He thought that her cherubic face appeared even more
        <p></p>innocent in repose. She stared absently for a moment, eyes blank and cloudy with
        <p></p>sleep, and then frowned and settled back down.
        <p></p>When Amane started to pull his hand away, Mahiru stirred, and her cheek brushed
        <p></p>against his fingers again. "…Nn…" A dainty sigh rose in her throat.
        <p></p>To Amane, it almost seemed like she was saying Don't go.
        <p></p>Of course, Mahiru was obviously still half asleep. She would definitely never act like
        <p></p>this under any normal circumstances.
        <p></p>Even so, Amane thought that her movements reminded him of an affectionate kitten.
        <p></p>The day had only just begun, and already his brain was failing him. He couldn't decide
        <p></p>whether to pull back or keep caressing her cheek. Despite all sense and reason, his
        <p></p>heart was really leaning toward the latter. After all, he rarely got to see Mahiru this
        <p></p>unguarded, and he wanted to see how much he could get away with.
        <p></p>But Amane knew that if Mahiru caught him acting on his desire, she wouldn't listen to
        <p></p>a word he had to say. He knew without a doubt that this would all make her incredibly
        <p></p>uncomfortable, so he stopped short.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to be coming around slowly, but she was obviously not awake just yet.
        <p></p>She hadn't moved, and her cheek was still pressed against Amane's fingers.
        <p></p>He had come into the room looking to check on her and maybe grab a change of clothes
        <p></p>while he was at it. How had he ended up doing something like this? Amane felt his
        <p></p>cheeks grow hot as it fully dawned on him just how unspeakably creepy he was acting.
        <p></p>"Nn-ngh…"
        <p></p>After another moment, Mahiru's eyelids finally started to flutter open again…
        <p></p>"…Ah."
        <p></p>They locked eyes.
        <p></p>Mahiru's gaze flicked from Amane, who was leaning over her, to his extended finger.
        <p></p>She immediately sat bolt upright.
        <p></p>"M-morning," Amane stammered.
        <p></p>"…G-good morning…"
        <p></p>"You fell asleep at my place, so I let you stay the night here, but I didn't have any ulterior
        <p></p>motives and I swear I didn't do anything, so really, I hope you can appreciate all that…"
        <p></p>Amane said, the words pouring out in a rush as he struggled to explain.
        <p></p>As she listened to Amane's jumbled account, Mahiru stayed quiet, but her cheeks
        <p></p>quickly flushed bright red as it dawned on her where she had slept, and she tugged at
        <p></p>a corner of the futon, practically hiding herself with it.
        <p></p>Finding even that small gesture charming, Amane quickly turned away.
        <p></p>What is happening here?
        <p></p>Even though he had lent her a bed for the night, he was starting to feel bad. He knew
        <p></p>that he had been wrong to touch her without permission. But it had only been for a
        <p></p>moment, and he had absolutely no intention of taking it any further.
        <p></p>Amane looked back at Mahiru. His heart was pounding in his chest. He didn't know if
        <p></p>it was because he was smitten with her or from feeling guilty. He saw that her cheeks
        <p></p>were still tinged red, and she was staring at him with a sullen look… or not quite sullen.
        <p></p>It seemed like she had something to say to him.
        <p></p>"…Amane, do you like touching my cheeks?"
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"I mean, you touched me at Christmas and then again yesterday when I fell asleep,
        <p></p>didn't you?"
        <p></p>"…So you were awake the whole time?"
        <p></p>The other night, when he had stroked her cheek… he'd thought that she'd been fast
        <p></p>asleep. That she would never know he'd touched her. But she did, because she'd
        <p></p>actually been awake at the time.
        <p></p>"Well, you see, I briefly woke up just as I was being lowered into bed… Moreover, how
        <p></p>could I do anything else in a situation like that?"
        <p></p>"Weren't you worried about me… doing something?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"…I never thought you would do anything like that, but… in order to confirm my
        <p></p>suspicions, I pretended to be asleep."
        <p></p>Apparently, falling asleep in front of him had been some kind of test to determine
        <p></p>whether he was really worthy of her trust. Ultimately, it seemed like she was leaning
        <p></p>toward yes rather than no, for which he was glad.
        <p></p>Amane hoped she wouldn't test that out again. He really wasn't sure he would do any
        <p></p>better the next time he was faced with controlling himself when she was that same
        <p></p>charming vulnerability, either.
        <p></p>"…Well, I'm glad you haven't decided I'm totally shady. Also please don't try any more
        <p></p>tests. I am a man, after all."
        <p></p>"Uh, I kn-know that, but—"
        <p></p>"Or maybe you were expecting me to try something?"
        <p></p>"Of course not!" Mahiru firmly denied, pulling the comforter back up around her. She
        <p></p>was practically shaking, and Amane thought he'd seen her start to blush, just a little.
        <p></p>He wisely swallowed the urge to make a joke about her being in his bed.
        <p></p>For now, it was probably a good idea to give Mahiru some space until she regained her
        <p></p>composure.
        <p></p>After that inexplicable bout of awkwardness, Mahiru returned to her apartment to
        <p></p>freshen up before coming back again. But it was obvious that she was still embarrassed
        <p></p>because she refused to make eye contact with Amane. Every time he tried to catch her
        <p></p>gaze, she turned away. Even though she was sitting on the sofa right next to him, it was
        <p></p>like she was miles away.
        <p></p>"…Please forgive me," Amane said, stomach twisting in knots.
        <p></p>Mahiru quickly glanced over at him, then sighed softly. Maybe she wasn't as upset
        <p></p>anymore; she was wearing her usual serene expression. "I'm not angry. You don't have
        <p></p>to apologize, Amane."
        <p></p>"Well, I think—"
        <p></p>"I suppose I'm mostly upset with myself for being so careless, that's all. I really wish
        <p></p>you hadn't seen me like that."
        <p></p>"Like… what? I thought you looked really sweet…"
        <p></p>Mahiru's dreaming face had reminded him why people called her an angel, but more
        <p></p>importantly, he had discovered that just after she woke up, in the moments between
        <p></p>sleep and wakefulness, her usual cool and collected demeanor gave way to a youthful
        <p></p>innocence that he found extremely charming.
        <p></p>If anything, Amane wanted to see her like that again.
        <p></p>But it was clear that Mahiru was not happy that he'd seen her with her guard down.
        <p></p>Before Amane could argue any further, she bit her lip hard and suddenly whacked him
        <p></p>with a pillow. It didn't hurt or anything—it was obvious that Mahiru wasn't really
        <p></p>trying—but it caught Amane by surprise.
        <p></p>"What the heck?"
        <p></p>"…You know, I hate that about you, Amane."
        <p></p>"Hate what? At least tell me what I did wrong."
        <p></p>"What you said… That's not the sort of thing that you can just say to a girl so casually,
        <p></p>you know?"
        <p></p>"Well it's not like I would say that sort of thing to anyone else…"
        <p></p>The only girls Amane knew were Mahiru and Chitose. And sure, Chitose was cute, but
        <p></p>Amane found her more annoying than anything else, and there was no need for him
        <p></p>to praise her to her face anyway. So who else would he even talk to like that?
        <p></p>Amane could see that Mahiru was feeling defensive. He watched her reactions carefully
        <p></p>as he continued. "Besides, you must be used to people saying those kinds of things
        <p></p>about you, right?" He shrugged. "Why should it bother you now?"
        <p></p>After all, he had told Mahiru many times that he thought she was cute. It didn't seem
        <p></p>like the kind of thing that would suddenly become a sticking point. She knew how
        <p></p>beautiful she was.
        <p></p>She can't be that embarrassed just because of a little compliment.
        <p></p>That's what Amane thought, but for some reason, Mahiru was still wearing a sour face.
        <p></p>"Seriously, what's the matter?"
        <p></p>"…It's nothing."
        <p></p>She landed one final attack by whacking him again with the cushion, then Mahiru
        <p></p>turned away sharply and said "I'm going to go make mochi soup" before putting on
        <p></p>her apron and heading for the kitchen.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't do anything but squeeze the cushion and stare at Mahiru's back as she
        <p></p>abruptly stalked out of the room.
        <p></p>By the time they finished eating the mochi soup, Mahiru was back to her usual self.
        <p></p>The start of the meal had been rather uncomfortable, but both the soup and the
        <p></p>assorted osechi dishes were so delicious that Amane had quickly forgotten everything
        <p></p>else, and before he realized it, Mahiru's spirits had recovered.
        <p></p>As they moved from the table back to sitting together on the sofa, Amane asked, "By
        <p></p>the way, are you planning to go for a shrine visit to start off the New Year, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Shrine visit? I wasn't really planning to go… I don't like crowds, you know. People
        <p></p>always stare at me."
        <p></p>"That's because you're…"
        <p></p>He had been about to say "…because you're so beautiful," but the mood had only just
        <p></p>recovered after his earlier faux pas, so he swallowed the words and only said "Well, I
        <p></p>guess there's not a ton you can do about that" instead.
        <p></p>"Are you going to go to one, Amane?"
        <p></p>"I always went with my parents when I was back home, but I was just wondering
        <p></p>whether I should go. I was thinking that it might be best to pass, at least on New Year's
        <p></p>Day."
        <p></p>"Agreed."
        <p></p>"Chitose and Itsuki are having a cozy time at her place, so they're not around, and kids
        <p></p>these days don't make a big deal out of the first shrine visit of the year anyway, you
        <p></p>know? I think we can put it off."
        <p></p>Compared to the old days… for young people, especially those in their teens and
        <p></p>twenties, first-day-of-the-year shrine visits were getting less and less popular. Amane
        <p></p>and Mahiru wouldn't be especially strange for skipping out.
        <p></p>It wasn't exactly that he didn't want to go, but he knew that there would be too many
        <p></p>people to be able to move comfortably and that the experience would just end up
        <p></p>being exhausting, so he was thinking it would probably be better to go after the crowds
        <p></p>thinned out a bit.
        <p></p>"Besides," Amane continued, "I want to spend the first three days of the New Year
        <p></p>relaxing. I don't really care about holiday bargains or anything, either."
        <p></p>"Actually, I am sort of interested in the special blind bags some stores have," Mahiru
        <p></p>mentioned.
        <p></p>"Are you going to a shopping mall or somewhere?"
        <p></p>She shook her head. "…I'm not brave enough to charge into those crowds."
        <p></p>"Agreed."
        <p></p>Amane replied in the same way Mahiru had a moment ago and leaned back into the
        <p></p>sofa.
        <p></p>There was definitely no need to go anywhere just because it was New Year's Day.
        <p></p>Amane was perfectly content taking it easy at home. He preferred to avoid stressful
        <p></p>situations, after all. And since they'd be spending the holiday together, he certainly
        <p></p>wouldn't want for food or conversation.
        <p></p>Thinking to himself what a luxurious New Year's holiday this was turning out to be,
        <p></p>Amane stole a glance at Mahiru sitting beside him as a small smile crept onto his face.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 18: : Visiting Parents and the First Shrine Visit of the Year 
        <p></p>e stole a glance at Mahiru sitting beside him as a small smile crept onto his face.
        <p></p>"Can we visit your apartment tomorrow, Amane?"
        <p></p>Amane's father, Shuuto, sent that message at ten o'clock in the evening on January 3—
        <p></p>after dinner and after Mahiru had gone home.
        <p></p>"It's all right that you didn't come home for the holiday, but I do want to see you. Besides,
        <p></p>I heard about her from your mother, but I think I'd better say hello to your neighbor
        <p></p>myself."
        <p></p>His father probably wanted to meet the person taking such good care of his son. And
        <p></p>since Amane's mother had already discovered his relationship with Mahiru, and was
        <p></p>actually in regular contact with her, Amane didn't see much point in refusing.
        <p></p>He no longer had anything to hide, and he didn't want to turn his parents away after
        <p></p>not visiting for the holidays. Plus, Amane figured that the presence of his father should
        <p></p>help keep his mother in check and prevent her from making a big scene. If nothing
        <p></p>else, Amane was counting on him to help him avoid a repeat of her last exhausting
        <p></p>visit.
        <p></p>Besides, Amane had a feeling that even if he did refuse his parents, his mother would
        <p></p>come over to see Mahiru anyway, so after setting up a time with his father (who had
        <p></p>been courteous enough to ask in advance) Amane sent Mahiru a heads-up message.
        <p></p>"Um, well, is it all right for me to be there during your family time? Won't I be intruding?"
        <p></p>The next day, Mahiru came over to Amane's apartment early. She seemed nervous.
        <p></p>That was only to be expected, in a way. Mahiru had been taking care of him… though
        <p></p>phrasing it that way sounded a bit misleading… In any case, Mahiru had been spending
        <p></p>a lot of time with him, and now his parents wanted to meet her.
        <p></p>She was already used to talking with his mother, or at least being talked at by his
        <p></p>mother, but Amane's father would be joining this time. It was no surprise that she was
        <p></p>nervous.
        <p></p>"Well, now that Dad is coming to say hello, and since Mom has taken such a liking to
        <p></p>you, I'd appreciate it if you were here. Really, I need you here."
        <p></p>"Y-you say that, but…"
        <p></p>"I'm sure you would rather avoid it, but it'd really mean a lot to me if you'd put up with
        <p></p>it just for a little while."
        <p></p>It was somewhat surreal to be introducing her to his parents, but they'd requested,
        <p></p>and now there was no way around it.
        <p></p>He felt bad for taking up Mahiru's time, but he knew that his father was the type of
        <p></p>person who likely wouldn't rest until he'd met her, so he hoped she wouldn't mind it
        <p></p>too much.
        <p></p>"…I wonder what Shihoko has told him about me."
        <p></p>"Relax. I made sure to tell my dad that you are someone who helps me out a lot. Even
        <p></p>if he gets the wrong idea, I've already told him that my mother's crazy ideas about you
        <p></p>are not at all true."
        <p></p>Amane's mother seemed to have already decided that Mahiru was his bride-to-be and
        <p></p>her very own future daughter-in-law. Amane had made sure to firmly deny everything
        <p></p>coming out of her mouth. His father had laughed and said, "Shihoko has always had
        <p></p>the bad habit of letting her imagination run wild." So apparently, he understood the
        <p></p>situation.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed relieved to hear that, and Amane smiled wryly as they waited. "Sorry
        <p></p>about this."
        <p></p>Then, with perfect timing, the intercom rang.
        <p></p>His parents had already gotten past the lobby with their duplicate key, so he expected
        <p></p>that they had come directly to his door.
        <p></p>At the sound of the chime, Mahiru shuddered in surprise, so Amane shot her a small
        <p></p>smile to put her at ease and headed for the door. He took the chain off and unfastened
        <p></p>the lock.
        <p></p>When he opened the door, there stood his parents, just as he remembered them.
        <p></p>"It's been half a year, Amane."
        <p></p>"Long time no see, Dad."
        <p></p>Amane greeted Shuuto's amicable smile with a slightly relieved grin of his own.
        <p></p>With his gentle demeanor, Shuuto was the type of person who somehow calmed things
        <p></p>down just by being around. Amane relaxed a little simply seeing him there.
        <p></p>"You didn't seem nearly as happy to see your mother…," Shihoko said.
        <p></p>"That's because my mother forced her way in without so much as a warning. If you'd
        <p></p>ever give me any notice, I would react normally."
        <p></p>The last time Shihoko had shown up, Mahiru had been at his place, and he'd tried to
        <p></p>turn her away. If he'd been alone, he probably would have treated her a little nicer.
        <p></p>"Well anyway, come on in," Amane added. "What's with the package?"
        <p></p>"Oh, we brought you all sorts of things. But we can look at that later. Where's Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Inside," Amane answered succinctly. After his parents had removed their shoes, he
        <p></p>led them into the living room.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed anxious as she looked over at them and blinked, wide-eyed, in
        <p></p>understandable surprise.
        <p></p>Amane's father looked remarkably young. He didn't seem to be much past thirty,
        <p></p>especially if you forgot that he had a teenage son, and had a youthful, handsome face.
        <p></p>More than once, Amane had wished that he took more after his father, whose tender
        <p></p>features made him seem like a well-mannered young man (though in actuality, he was
        <p></p>middle-aged). When the two of them walked side by side, they looked more like
        <p></p>distant brothers than father and son.
        <p></p>"Mahiru dear, it's been too long," Shihoko said.
        <p></p>"'Too long'? It's only been a month!" Amane remarked.
        <p></p>"I think that counts." Shihoko approached Mahiru wearing a beaming smile.
        <p></p>Mahiru stood straighter and greeted her with a formal "How good to see you again,"
        <p></p>wearing the faint smile that was an integral part of her public persona.
        <p></p>But her bewildered eyes were still straying toward Amane's father, standing next to
        <p></p>Shihoko. Shuuto smiled warmly when he noticed Mahiru looking.
        <p></p>"Nice to meet you. I'm Amane's father, Shuuto Fujimiya. I've heard about you from
        <p></p>Shihoko, Miss Shiina. Thank you for taking such good care of our son."
        <p></p>"Nice to meet you. I'm Mahiru Shiina. And I appreciate everything Amane does for me
        <p></p>as well."
        <p></p>Shuuto bowed politely, and Mahiru introduced herself courteously.
        <p></p>Mahiru had probably been worried that Amane's father would be a lot like his mother,
        <p></p>but Shuuto was a mild-mannered man with a good head on his shoulders, and he was
        <p></p>doing his best to put Mahiru at ease.
        <p></p>Shuuto was generally the one who reined in Shihoko's wilder tendencies. Really, he
        <p></p>was the only person she would listen to, which proved just how much she loved him.
        <p></p>"Goodness, you don't have to be so modest!" Shihoko interrupted. "Amane is a slob,
        <p></p>after all."
        <p></p>"Geez, sorry I don't meet your standards…," Amane muttered.
        <p></p>"Come now, Shihoko, don't say things like that," his father said. "…And, Amane, this girl
        <p></p>is taking care of you day in, day out, so I'm sure you're showing her the appropriate
        <p></p>gratitude and appreciation, right?"
        <p></p>"As best I can."
        <p></p>"That's what I like to hear."
        <p></p>Shuuto, who had raised Amane to treasure women, had apparently been worried over
        <p></p>whether his son was being considerate enough. Of course Amane would have found it
        <p></p>unbearable to kick back while Mahiru did everything, so he did whatever he could for
        <p></p>her.
        <p></p>Shuuto seemed reassured by Amane's answer and turned his gaze toward Mahiru
        <p></p>again.
        <p></p>"…Truly, I must offer you my thanks. I hear you've been fixing my son's meals every
        <p></p>day, and you were even kind enough to make osechi dishes for the holiday…"
        <p></p>"I'm always thanking her for that. I've been trying to show my appreciation every
        <p></p>chance I get, too."
        <p></p>"It's true…" Mahiru nodded. "Amane's surprisingly considerate."
        <p></p>"Surprisingly?" Amane asked. "And what's so surprising about it?"
        <p></p>"Th-that is, I—I mean…," Mahiru stammered. "You seemed… a bit neglectful at first
        <p></p>glance, but it turns out you actually pay rather close attention."
        <p></p>Amane found himself at a loss for words, unable to refute anything she said.
        <p></p>"The most important thing is that the two of you are getting along well," Shuuto said
        <p></p>with a gentle smile. "Amane, make sure you're not being too much of a bother to Miss
        <p></p>Shiina."
        <p></p>"…I know that."
        <p></p>"And, Miss Shiina, I'd like you to speak up right away if Amane gives you any trouble.
        <p></p>My son might not seem like it, but he's really quite an earnest young man, so I believe
        <p></p>he'll do his best to smooth over any… rough patches."
        <p></p>"Amane is a nice guy. I can't think of anything rough about him… well, maybe just a tiny
        <p></p>bit…"
        <p></p>"He's not exactly the smoothest, eh?"
        <p></p>"No… he's not really disagreeable… more like, he's just a little hopeless."
        <p></p>Mahiru was fidgeting as if she was having a hard time saying what was on her mind. It
        <p></p>made Amane want to cross-examine her.
        <p></p>What exactly is so hopeless that you had to say it like that?
        <p></p>For some reason that Amane didn't understand, Shihoko seemed to grasp what
        <p></p>Mahiru getting at. She looked over at him with a broad grin. "Ah-haah!"
        <p></p>Amane couldn't do much more than glare at his mother in irritation.
        <p></p>"Here you are."
        <p></p>Amane's parents were guests in his apartment, so it was only natural to treat them as
        <p></p>such. However, Mahiru had insisted on being the one to set out the tea, so Amane had
        <p></p>left it in her capable hands.
        <p></p>Mahiru had brought her tea set over to his apartment so she could use it whenever
        <p></p>she visited. Amane had never imagined it would be used for this, though.
        <p></p>Both of his parents were wearing warm smiles, seated on the sofa where Amane and
        <p></p>Mahiru usually sat together.
        <p></p>"My goodness, thank you, Mahiru dear. You're quite skilled at hosting visitors, aren't
        <p></p>you?"
        <p></p>"Y-yes."
        <p></p>"Though, really, that should be Amane's job, you know?"
        <p></p>Mahiru was doing it because when Amane tried brewing tea, it usually turned out
        <p></p>much too bitter.
        <p></p>Still, Shihoko looked somewhat aghast.
        <p></p>"No, I wanted to do it, but…"
        <p></p>"Well, I suppose that's fine, since Amane never gets the water temperature right."
        <p></p>His mother was absolutely correct, but it made him a little irritated that she pointed
        <p></p>it out so blatantly.
        <p></p>However, he couldn't deny the truth, so he stoically kept his mouth shut as Shihoko
        <p></p>turned to him and smiled.
        <p></p>"Come to think of it, Amane, you've finally started calling sweetie Mahiru by her first
        <p></p>name, haven't you?"
        <p></p>At this sudden observation, both Amane and Mahiru froze.
        <p></p>They had grown so comfortable talking to each other that they hadn't noticed, but last
        <p></p>time they had seen Amane's mother, the two of them had still been addressing each
        <p></p>other quite formally.
        <p></p>"…What's it matter?"
        <p></p>"I think it's great!" His mother beamed. "It's nice that you're getting more intimate."
        <p></p>Without pressing the issue any further, Shihoko just sat and beamed at them.
        <p></p>Amane could feel his cheek begin to twitch. He almost wished she would just make
        <p></p>fun of him. It would have been easier than dealing with his mother's wild assumptions
        <p></p>and fabricated narratives.
        <p></p>"Shihoko dear, don't tease Amane so much," Amane's father interjected. "It's a bad
        <p></p>habit of yours," he added.
        <p></p>"All right, honey. You know I just can't help myself." Amane's mother capitulated to his
        <p></p>father without much resistance, a fact for which their long-suffering son was acutely
        <p></p>grateful. "But it's wonderful, isn't it? To see our son getting on so well with a cute girl?"
        <p></p>"I'm more concerned about whether you might get carried away again, Shihoko darling."
        <p></p>"When that happens, you'll step in for me, won't you, Shuuto darling?"
        <p></p>"On some level, I wish you'd work on it if you're already aware it's an issue… but that's
        <p></p>also part of what makes you the woman I fell in love with, so I suppose there's no
        <p></p>helping it."
        <p></p>"Ho-ho… what a sly fox you are."
        <p></p>Even though he was glad Shihoko had eased up on him, Amane couldn't help but sigh
        <p></p>as his parents drifted off into their own little world.
        <p></p>His father was fundamentally a sensible man, but he had the unfortunate habit of
        <p></p>doting on his treasured wife, which sometimes made it a little awkward for anyone
        <p></p>else stuck in the same room.
        <p></p>Fortunately, they only did this in front of family and didn't act so embarrassingly in
        <p></p>public. On the other hand, this was supposed to be Amane's apartment, and he wished
        <p></p>they would show a little more restraint. He was glad that his parents still had a strong
        <p></p>relationship after so many years together, but they could have been more considerate
        <p></p>about their public displays of affection.
        <p></p>Whenever they got like this, Amane didn't like to force himself in between them, so he
        <p></p>simply sat down in the chair he had brought over from the dining room and sighed
        <p></p>deeply again in resignation.
        <p></p>Mahiru also took a seat in the chair he had set up next to his, and asked Amane quietly,
        <p></p>"…Your parents get along very well, don't they?"
        <p></p>"Sure do. I mean, they're not like that outside, but that's definitely how they are at
        <p></p>home."
        <p></p>"I see," Mahiru answered with a peculiar smile, then looked over at Shihoko and Shuuto.
        <p></p>She didn't seem uncomfortable at all—just the opposite, in fact. Mahiru looked like
        <p></p>she was staring at something dazzling and priceless. Amane thought he saw a touch
        <p></p>of envy in her gaze as she smiled so faintly that the word fleeting didn't do it justice.
        <p></p>Without thinking, Amane extended a hand toward hers—
        <p></p>"Oh, Amane, what is it?"
        <p></p>He immediately withdrew his hand as the sound of Shihoko's voice pulled him back to
        <p></p>his senses.
        <p></p>"Don't ask me. You and Dad went off into your own world. The two of us could barely
        <p></p>stand to look at you."
        <p></p>"Oh, are you jealous?"
        <p></p>"Not a chance. I was just thinking that you should get a room. In the privacy of your
        <p></p>own home, preferably."
        <p></p>His mother didn't seem to have noticed that he had been on the verge of grabbing
        <p></p>Mahiru's hand. Mahiru also seemed not to have noticed and forced a smile at Amane's
        <p></p>words.
        <p></p>He didn't understand why he had instinctually reached out toward her. For some
        <p></p>reason… he had felt like he couldn't bear the thought of leaving Mahiru all alone.
        <p></p>She was already back to her usual self, so Amane felt slightly relieved and put on his
        <p></p>usual surly expression so that no one would be any the wiser.
        <p></p>"So are you satisfied now, having seen your son's face?" Amane demanded.
        <p></p>"I'm more satisfied seeing sweet Mahiru than you, Amane…" His mother leered.
        <p></p>"Hey…"
        <p></p>"I'm only joking. We still haven't accomplished our real mission yet, you know."
        <p></p>"Your real what now…?"
        <p></p>Amane had assumed that they had come over to simply exchange New Year's greetings
        <p></p>and meet Mahiru, but his mother seemed to have some other goal in mind.
        <p></p>"You and Mahiru haven't been on your first shrine visit of the year yet, right?"
        <p></p>"We were planning to go after the crowds die down."
        <p></p>"I knew it! And you haven't been yet, either, right, Mahiru? I asked in my message."
        <p></p>"Right." Mahiru nodded.
        <p></p>"I thought that would be the case, so we brought kimonos!"
        <p></p>Apparently, his mother wanted to go on a shrine visit with Mahiru.
        <p></p>Shihoko was wearing a wide grin as Amane finally realized the reason why she had
        <p></p>brought such a large bag with her. He sighed again. He'd lost count of how many times
        <p></p>today.
        <p></p>Shihoko loved cute things, and she loved playing dress-up, so she'd probably been
        <p></p>waiting for a chance like this.
        <p></p>Amane also recalled that his mother had a large number of kimonos at home.
        <p></p>Apparently, she had brought some with her.
        <p></p>"I've always dreamed of putting a kimono on a daughter and going on a shrine visit
        <p></p>together… Oh, I'm sure this one will suit you, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"Mom, you just want a dress-up doll."
        <p></p>"That's not true! But I really do want to dress up Mahiru. Look, this one would suit her
        <p></p>so well!" Shihoko was full of confidence, and her opinion was correct, insofar as there
        <p></p>were hardly any clothes that wouldn't suit Mahiru.
        <p></p>Amane had seen her in everything from boyish outfits to fancy getups on top of her
        <p></p>usual girly outfits that featured plenty of frills and lace. As far as he could remember,
        <p></p>each and every style seemed to suit Mahiru just fine. Apparently, beautiful people
        <p></p>didn't need to be choosy about what they wore. It was not hard to imagine that
        <p></p>traditional Japanese clothes would really suit her as well.
        <p></p>Amane was an only child, so his mother was obviously not going to pass up this chance
        <p></p>to dress up the daughter of her dreams.
        <p></p>"…Well, if Mahiru says it's all right, how about you dress her up and go?"
        <p></p>"Why are you talking like you're not coming, Amane?"
        <p></p>"I can't; it'll be trouble if I go out with Mahiru and people from school see us together."
        <p></p>If it was only his parents and Mahiru, they would just look like any other family going
        <p></p>on a shrine visit, so it wouldn't rouse any suspicions, but if Amane joined them, and
        <p></p>someone from their class spotted him at the shrine with Mahiru, well, he imagined
        <p></p>that the start of the winter semester would turn into something out of a nightmare.
        <p></p>No shrine visit was worth that risk.
        <p></p>"So it'll be all right as long as no one finds out?"
        <p></p>"I suppose, but I'm pretty sure it'd be really… Uh, wait. I don't like where this is going,
        <p></p>Mom…"
        <p></p>"Heh-heh! I came prepared for situations just like this!"
        <p></p>"What situations?!"
        <p></p>He had thought that she'd brought an awful lot of luggage for only kimonos and
        <p></p>underclothes and accessories. Apparently, she had brought even more stuff so she
        <p></p>could play dress-up with Amane as well.
        <p></p>"Your father is also very excited, you know."
        <p></p>"Dad…"
        <p></p>"We don't get to go out together very often," Amane's father said, "and it is our family's
        <p></p>tradition, after all, so I'd like us to all go together."
        <p></p>When he put it that way, it was difficult to refuse.
        <p></p>Amane's father cared a great deal about family traditions. He would feel bad for
        <p></p>refusing to go along after both his parents made it clear how much they wanted it.
        <p></p>"But look—"
        <p></p>"It's fine, dear. You just let your mother take care of it. I'll make you look like a stylish
        <p></p>young man. I promise you won't even resemble the old Amane!"
        <p></p>"Isn't that basically the same as saying I'm not stylish now?"
        <p></p>"Of course, you've got good features because you take after your father, but your
        <p></p>haircut and clothes are so unfashionable. I'd say you look gloomy."
        <p></p>"I didn't ask."
        <p></p>Amane was painfully aware of his drab appearance, but he looked like this because he
        <p></p>liked to, so he didn't appreciate the criticism.
        <p></p>"You'd think that someone so handsome would have an easy time looking cool, but
        <p></p>you're a troublesome case, Amane…"
        <p></p>"That's none of your business."
        <p></p>"It's such a waste… right, Mahiru dear? Wouldn't you like to see Amane all tidied up?"
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>As the conversation suddenly shifted to her, Mahiru became visibly flustered.
        <p></p>Amane wished that his mother wouldn't prod at Mahiru so aggressively, but she
        <p></p>continued needling the poor girl.
        <p></p>"Once Amane is all dressed up, I think you'll see him in a whole new light, too, Mahiru.
        <p></p>He may not look it, but Amane's got a fairly handsome face, you know? Personalitywise, he's got some work to do, but he does resemble Shuuto, and he knows how to be
        <p></p>a gentleman, so if you train him well, I think he could turn out quite nice."
        <p></p>"Ah, um… I… suppose so…?" Mahiru stammered.
        <p></p>"And don't you want to go on the first shrine visit of the year together?"
        <p></p>"W-well I… um… I do want to go, but…"
        <p></p>"Hey, how could you double-cross me like that?" Amane whined.
        <p></p>He'd been counting on her to consider what might happen in the worst-case scenario
        <p></p>and reject his parents' proposal.
        <p></p>Mahiru glanced at the beleaguered Amane. "…If Amane doesn't want to, it's fine," she
        <p></p>said in a quiet, slightly discouraged voice, frowning.
        <p></p>Amane choked. She was trying to hide it, but he could tell that Mahiru was disappointed.
        <p></p>It wasn't anything dramatic; just a subtle change in her expression. Looking at her long
        <p></p>eyelashes fluttering over her downcast eyes, Amane felt a powerful knot of guilt
        <p></p>tighten in his chest.
        <p></p>His mother shot him a look of condemnation, as if to say You made sweet Mahiru sad!
        <p></p>and his father wore an expression that said It would be easier to fold here.
        <p></p>Amane groaned quietly and simply said, "…All right."
        <p></p>When Mahiru made a face like that, there was nothing to do but give in.
        <p></p>"Okay, you're all set."
        <p></p>Shihoko had been tinkering wildly with Amane's hair and clothes, until he was quite
        <p></p>exhausted by the time he was finally set free.
        <p></p>It had been pure agony for him, who wasn't much interested in clothes, but when he
        <p></p>checked himself in the mirror, he could see that his suffering had been worth it. Staring
        <p></p>back at him was a handsome young man, completely unlike the usual Amane.
        <p></p>The outfit Shihoko had chosen for him was a dark-gray Chesterfield coat over a white
        <p></p>turtleneck, paired with black slacks—clean and casual.
        <p></p>Since this was supposed to be an auspicious New Year's event, she had apparently
        <p></p>thought it was critical that he dress up a little. Amane usually didn't like especially
        <p></p>colorful clothing, so this subdued, monochrome arrangement pleased him.
        <p></p>He checked his hairstyle, too, and saw that his mother's skill with a flat iron and some
        <p></p>styling wax had really worked wonders with his long bangs. His eyes had emerged
        <p></p>from their usual hiding spot behind his hair, and the impression he gave off was much
        <p></p>brighter now that you could actually see his whole face. The extra volume in his hair
        <p></p>plus the excellent styling made him look more dignified and refined as well.
        <p></p>The person in the mirror wasn't the Amane who got teased by his mother and Itsuki
        <p></p>for being gloomy, but a bright young man who Amane had never seen before.
        <p></p>"You can turn into such a good-looking young man with just a little work, so I wonder
        <p></p>why you don't do it?"
        <p></p>"Because I don't want to."
        <p></p>"You can really be such a grouch sometimes. Your face is usually dour, so unless you
        <p></p>smile, you won't look good, you know?"
        <p></p>Being called dour stung, but Amane couldn't argue with the facts.
        <p></p>"All right, I'm going to go put the finishing touches on Mahiru, so you go wait in the
        <p></p>living room."
        <p></p>Amane had been busy in his room, so he didn't have any idea how Mahiru was getting
        <p></p>on. She had gone back to her apartment to dress herself, presumably to quite a high
        <p></p>standard.
        <p></p>He watched his mother leave the room, then looked himself over in the mirror again.
        <p></p>He hadn't gotten dressed up like this in a long time, so he didn't resemble himself.
        <p></p>"…Well, I guess it's not bad."
        <p></p>He was sure he'd still look shabby standing next to Mahiru, but this was a big
        <p></p>improvement.
        <p></p>Playing with his bangs a little, now that they weren't hanging in front of his eyes,
        <p></p>Amane muttered under his breath that sprucing himself up like this from time to time
        <p></p>probably wouldn't be a bad thing.
        <p></p>After waiting in the living room with his father for the better part of an hour, Amane
        <p></p>heard the front door open.
        <p></p>He had heard that women's preparations could take quite a lot of time and effort, so
        <p></p>he hadn't been particularly unhappy with the wait itself, but he was still a bit worried
        <p></p>about leaving Mahiru alone and whether his mother might have crossed any lines.
        <p></p>Finally, thought Amane as he stood up from the sofa and looked toward the entryway,
        <p></p>just as Mahiru quietly arrived in the living room.
        <p></p>The moment he laid eyes on her, he was stunned.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't normally wear traditional Japanese clothing, so he had never had the
        <p></p>chance to see her in it.
        <p></p>He had thought for sure that a kimono would look good on her, but—he hadn't
        <p></p>expected this.
        <p></p>According to his mother, it would be difficult to move through a crowd in a longsleeved kimono, so she had chosen something shorter. With its light-pink color and
        <p></p>small, repeating pattern of plum blossoms, the kimono suited Mahiru so well that it
        <p></p>was hard to believe it didn't actually belong to her.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't normally wear much pink, but it gave her an air of refinement and
        <p></p>femininity.
        <p></p>Her light-colored hair had been left out in long bangs on the sides, and the rest had
        <p></p>been gathered into a bun and decorated with a kanzashi hair clip. Swaying across the
        <p></p>pure-white nape of her neck, the accessory accentuated the girlishness of the
        <p></p>ensemble and gave her a distinctly feminine allure.
        <p></p>The elegant outfit, coupled with makeup that had been judiciously applied to enhance
        <p></p>her natural good looks, elevated Mahiru to the pinnacle of grace and beauty.
        <p></p>"So?" Amane's mother beamed. "I think we made her look very cute. Sweet Mahiru is
        <p></p>so lovely to begin with, and dolling her up really had quite the effect."
        <p></p>"Yes, it certainly suits her, dear," his father quickly agreed.
        <p></p>Mahiru had her eyes cast downward, looking rather embarrassed by all the praise.
        <p></p>Even that movement had something alluring about it.
        <p></p>Beauty can really be terrifying.
        <p></p>"Come on, Amane, say something."
        <p></p>"I think it looks good."
        <p></p>There was obviously no way he could possibly say what he really thought, especially
        <p></p>not right there in front of his parents, so Amane kept his praise safely subdued.
        <p></p>His mother looked extremely dissatisfied.
        <p></p>"…That won't do at all!" she insisted.
        <p></p>"Oh, be quiet." Amane turned away. He was not going to engage with his mother any
        <p></p>further.
        <p></p>Shihoko gave an exasperated sigh at her son's behavior, but perhaps because she knew
        <p></p>him quite well, she seemed to agree to let it go.
        <p></p>"Good grief. Anyway, Mahiru darling, what do you think? Amane looks like a whole
        <p></p>new person, right?"
        <p></p>"Y-yes. This is completely different…"
        <p></p>"And to think even though he would be so popular if he put in the effort to look like
        <p></p>this all the time, he doesn't ever bother. Really, he's only harming himself."
        <p></p>Amane thought this was none of her business, but his mother sighed heavily again, as
        <p></p>if she truly regretted the loss of potential.
        <p></p>"I'm so disappointed in Amane—he has the good fortune to take after his father, and
        <p></p>yet he doesn't even try to put it to good use. What a waste!"
        <p></p>"Come now, Shihoko," his father said gently. "Amane's growing up in his own way."
        <p></p>"If he's growing up, then shouldn't he want to be popular?"
        <p></p>"If I had to guess, I'd say Amane is the type who is perfectly fine spending time with
        <p></p>just one other person rather than bothering with a crowd."
        <p></p>"I guess."
        <p></p>Amane's father had tried to stall Shihoko, but that only fueled her wildest delusions.
        <p></p>It was true Amane preferred to hang out one-on-one rather than tag along in a big
        <p></p>group… Apparently, that was something he had gotten from his father, and he really
        <p></p>did think it was best, but if he said as much, especially now, it would sound like he was
        <p></p>saying the person he preferred most was Mahiru…
        <p></p>His mother's radiant smile turned into a grimace, and she turned away.
        <p></p>Amane wondered why he had to put up with her unfair cynicism, but as a practical
        <p></p>matter, he was well aware that other people looked at him the same way.
        <p></p>At the very least, Amane could say that Mahiru was a special case. That was the truth,
        <p></p>but—
        <p></p>He snuck a glance at Mahiru, quickly, so she wouldn't notice, and sighed softly.
        <p></p>I guess I do like her, in a sense, he thought. I mean, what's not to like about her?
        <p></p>However, that was quite a different matter than declaring feelings of love.
        <p></p>"Mom, there is absolutely nothing going on, I'm telling you. So how about you stop it
        <p></p>with the crazy accusations and go get the car ready."
        <p></p>"What an ungrateful child you are… really! Well, all right, I suppose. Shuuto, let's go
        <p></p>prepare the car, shall we?"
        <p></p>"Sounds like a plan."
        <p></p>Amane had apparently succeeded in changing the subject, as both parents left to make
        <p></p>ready for their departure.
        <p></p>He was leaving it up to his parents to decide which shrine they were going to, and he
        <p></p>watched their backs as they left his apartment to head for the parking lot.
        <p></p>"…I've got the essentials in my bag, so I don't need much getting ready. How about you,
        <p></p>Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Everything I need is in this handbag, so I'm ready, too."
        <p></p>"Gotcha."
        <p></p>They were suddenly alone again, so with a slightly anxious feeling, Amane locked up
        <p></p>the windows and unplugged nonessential appliances from the walls.
        <p></p>Once he had turned off the living room lights, he looked at Mahiru again.
        <p></p>As always, it was immediately apparent she was a beauty. He doubted whether there
        <p></p>was another girl in the world who looked as good in a kimono.
        <p></p>He hadn't been comfortable praising her in front of his parents, but Amane was sure
        <p></p>that anyone who saw her would agree that Mahiru was particularly beautiful in
        <p></p>traditional Japanese dress.
        <p></p>"Is something the matter, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Oh, no, I was just thinking it really suits you. You look like an old-fashioned beauty
        <p></p>from a painting or something. The outfit's cute, and I think you're really lovely."
        <p></p>He had learned from his father that when a girl was smartly dressed, compliments
        <p></p>were in order, so he knew he should have praised her look the moment he saw her, but
        <p></p>he had been too embarrassed to do it in front of his parents.
        <p></p>Once Amane had voiced his honest appraisal, Mahiru dramatically blinked several
        <p></p>times, then blushed and pursed her lips tightly.
        <p></p>Recalling the last time she had reacted like that, Amane smiled bitterly.
        <p></p>"Ah, you don't like being complimented, right? Sorry."
        <p></p>"Th-that's not it, but… Amane, you're fairly—"
        <p></p>"Fairly what?"
        <p></p>"…It's nothing."
        <p></p>She abruptly turned away.
        <p></p>Amane wondered what was going on with her, but she didn't look like she was going
        <p></p>to elaborate, so Amane quietly finished closing up the apartment and accompanied
        <p></p>Mahiru to the door.
        <p></p>She seemed to have given some thought to the fact that they'd be walking around,
        <p></p>because she was wearing boots instead of the traditional sandals. Her choice of
        <p></p>footwear blended Japanese and western elements in her outfit, and she looked all the
        <p></p>more adorable for it.
        <p></p>Mahiru somehow wiggled into her boots, as her hair accessory swung back and forth
        <p></p>with a rustling sound, and Amane, who had gone out first to hold the door, found
        <p></p>himself suddenly quite close to her.
        <p></p>Mahiru caught him by surprise when she stood up on her tiptoes and gingerly leaned
        <p></p>even closer to him.
        <p></p>Thinking that maybe she wanted to tell him something, Amane shut the door and
        <p></p>locked it, then bent over to lend her his ear. Mahiru cupped her palms around her
        <p></p>mouth and whispered into his ear.
        <p></p>"Amane—"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"Um… You look good, too, you know?"
        <p></p>That was all she said before slipping past him and briskly heading for the elevator.
        <p></p>Amane promptly banged his head against his front door.
        <p></p>"…That's not fair."
        <p></p>Amane's heart was pounding like an alarm going off in his chest, his face was burning,
        <p></p>and his forehead hurt. Mahiru had set him ablaze in a single breath. This was her
        <p></p>revenge.
        <p></p>His parents looked at him suspiciously as he hustled to catch up to them in the parking
        <p></p>lot.
        <p></p>When they arrived at a famous shrine located in an area a little less than an hour away,
        <p></p>there weren't as many people as they had seen on television, but the crowds still
        <p></p>seemed practically endless.
        <p></p>"Well, it's thinned out quite a bit, but I'd say there are still plenty here, eh?" Amane's
        <p></p>mother remarked.
        <p></p>"There sure are…," Amane agreed.
        <p></p>"Mahiru darling, careful not to stray. We'll keep an eye on you, too, and we all have
        <p></p>smartphones, so I think finding one another would be easy enough. But even so, I want
        <p></p>us all to visit the shrine together, of course."
        <p></p>"Okay."
        <p></p>Dressed in a kimono, Mahiru had the hardest time moving out of all of them. The
        <p></p>restrictive garment forced her to take small steps and walk slowly. At least she was
        <p></p>wearing boots instead of sandals.
        <p></p>They didn't necessarily have to push their way through the crowd, but it was tight
        <p></p>enough that it was easy to run into people, so they had to proceed with caution.
        <p></p>"All right, shall we get going?"
        <p></p>Shihoko was leading the way through the crowd, and she headed first for the ablution
        <p></p>pavilion where they would purify their hands and mouths with water. As expected,
        <p></p>Mahiru was already attracting attention from many people.
        <p></p>More than a few people were dressed in kimonos, so Mahiru didn't stand out much for
        <p></p>wearing one… but that wasn't the issue.
        <p></p>She drew people's eyes even in her school uniform, when she wasn't dressed up at all.
        <p></p>Now that she looked like an aristocratic beauty in traditional Japanese clothing, she
        <p></p>obviously garnered a lot of attention. Even her motions as she cleaned her mouth were
        <p></p>graceful. Practically everyone in the shrine was staring.
        <p></p>"…Is something the matter?"
        <p></p>"No, nothing."
        <p></p>Though Amane was thinking it was all rather interesting, he didn't say as much, and
        <p></p>he cleansed his hands and mouth just as his parents had, then followed after them as
        <p></p>they walked on ahead.
        <p></p>He was doing his best to match pace with Mahiru, but as expected for someone who
        <p></p>didn't ordinarily wear Japanese clothes, the long hem was giving her some difficulty,
        <p></p>and the shrine was still quite crowded, so she was progressing much more slowly than
        <p></p>usual.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, are you all right?"
        <p></p>"Yes, this is… Aaah!"
        <p></p>She was getting bumped around by the other shrine-goers, which kept knocking her
        <p></p>off-balance and threatened to topple her outright, so Amane extended an arm to assist.
        <p></p>"You don't seem to be all right."
        <p></p>Of course she was uncomfortable walking around in a strange and complicated getup.
        <p></p>"…Sorry."
        <p></p>"Here, give me your hand."
        <p></p>Amane reached for one small hand that was peeking out of her kimono sleeve. Mahiru
        <p></p>looked up at him, and he nearly pulled his hand back, but she quickly pressed her palm
        <p></p>into his, keeping her eyes on him the whole time. He stared right back at her, though
        <p></p>he was not entirely sure why.
        <p></p>Mahiru squeezed Amane's hand tightly and looked away.
        <p></p>He tilted his head questioningly, and they followed the flow of the crowd for a moment,
        <p></p>until they were about to arrive in front of the offertory box, so Amane tucked whatever
        <p></p>small doubts he had away in his heart and focused on the sensation of her hand in his.
        <p></p>"You were praying for a really long time; what did you ask for?"
        <p></p>Once they had finished their visit and moved a distance away from the file of
        <p></p>worshippers, he posed this question to Mahiru, who had prayed at some length. She
        <p></p>had looked like a model going through all the motions of a shrine visit. After ringing
        <p></p>the bell, she had pressed her hands together for nearly twice as long as Amane. He had
        <p></p>been captivated by how elegantly she had offered her prayers, but he also wondered
        <p></p>what she had to pray for.
        <p></p>"Good health."
        <p></p>"An incredibly safe choice."
        <p></p>It was very typical of Mahiru.
        <p></p>She didn't want for very much, so Amane had wondered what she might have asked
        <p></p>for, but it was so predictable choice that her answer was kind of anticlimactic.
        <p></p>"That, and—"
        <p></p>"And?"
        <p></p>"…And to be able to keep spending peaceful days together, just like we have been."
        <p></p>Another very typical petition.
        <p></p>It was just the sort of thing that Mahiru, who didn't much care for excitement or
        <p></p>change, would pray for. It was very fitting, as she prized peace and quiet.
        <p></p>"We won't get much of that while my mom's around, though."
        <p></p>"That's something we can enjoy for what it is."
        <p></p>Is it, though…?
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure, but Mahiru seemed to be enjoying herself, so he didn't argue and
        <p></p>just took Mahiru's hand with a gentle smile.
        <p></p>They hadn't yet entirely extracted themselves from the crowd, and Amane was sure to
        <p></p>find himself in trouble if he let Mahiru trip and fall now. He could see his parents
        <p></p>waiting a short distance away, having already finished their own visit to the shrine.
        <p></p>That was why Amane was holding her hand, he told himself. Mahiru's eyelashes
        <p></p>fluttered, and she kept her eyes cast downward, looking embarrassed, but she
        <p></p>squeezed Amane's hand back.
        <p></p>"You two, over here!"
        <p></p>His mother's voice was bright and clear, easy to distinguish among the crowd.
        <p></p>Following her words, the two of them headed over to Amane's parents. Shihoko's eyes
        <p></p>went wide when she saw them, then she pressed a hand over her smiling mouth.
        <p></p>"Oh my, my!"
        <p></p>"What?"
        <p></p>"You're just holding hands so naturally."
        <p></p>It wasn't until she spelled it out that he realized what a mistake it was to hold Mahiru's
        <p></p>hand in front of his mother. This was the kind of thing that couples did, wasn't it? He
        <p></p>didn't appreciate Shihoko's suspicions and hated always being on the receiving end of
        <p></p>her smirking grins.
        <p></p>"…It's obviously so we don't lose sight of each other. Plus, it's easy for her to trip,
        <p></p>wearing a kimono."
        <p></p>"He's right. It's difficult to walk in a kimono, and he's doing the right thing by escorting
        <p></p>her. I do the same thing for you, Shihoko dear," Amane's father agreed. In a single
        <p></p>smooth motion, he grasped his wife's hand.
        <p></p>Amane's life would be easier if he were able to take a girl's hand as smoothly as his
        <p></p>father could, but he knew it was impossible given his personality, so he was secretly
        <p></p>grateful that Mahiru had been frank about taking his hand instead.
        <p></p>Feeling relieved that his mother's attention was occupied, Amane tried to gently let go
        <p></p>of Mahiru's hand, but she wouldn't relax her grip.
        <p></p>He could tell from the way she squeezed that she had no intention of separating, so he
        <p></p>quietly asked her what was wrong, but there was no answer. Her delicate fingers
        <p></p>simply held tightly to his.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, Mahiru sweetie, we were thinking of going to buy some hot drinks. Would
        <p></p>you like sweet red bean soup—or sweet sake?"
        <p></p>"Oh, I'll take red bean soup, please."
        <p></p>His mother's interruption spoiled any hope of asking Mahiru further questions or of
        <p></p>getting his hand back.
        <p></p>"How about you, Amane dear?"
        <p></p>"…All right, I'll have sweet sake."
        <p></p>"Coming right up."
        <p></p>As long as Mahiru doesn't hate this, I guess it's fine, right?
        <p></p>Amane tried to calm the fluttering in his chest as he adjusted his hand in hers.
        <p></p>Before long, Shihoko returned from the concessions stand and handed everyone their
        <p></p>drinks. At this point, it would have been incredibly awkward for them to continue
        <p></p>holding hands, so Mahiru let go, and Amane got the chance to catch his breath.
        <p></p>His parents were smiling at each other gently as they enjoyed their sweet sake.
        <p></p>They weren't quite off in their own world, but they were getting flirty, so Amane had
        <p></p>no desire to speak to them at the moment and instead focused on drinking his own
        <p></p>sweet sake.
        <p></p>Sweet sake like this was said to be so nutritious it was like having an IV drip, and as
        <p></p>the rich sweetness of the fermented rice spread through him, he unintentionally let
        <p></p>out a sigh that was a mix of astonishment and relief.
        <p></p>Amane didn't usually care much for sweets, though he did rather like red bean paste,
        <p></p>so he had also been tempted to choose the red bean soup. However, he had gone with
        <p></p>the sake because it felt more appropriate for New Year's, and he was confident that it
        <p></p>had been the right choice.
        <p></p>When he glanced over at Mahiru, he saw her sipping her sweet red bean soup from a
        <p></p>paper cup with a calm expression. She made it look absolutely delicious, and suddenly
        <p></p>he regretted his decision.
        <p></p>I wonder if I can get her to give me a sip?
        <p></p>He was gazing at her and wondering if he could get some if he asked, when Mahiru
        <p></p>noticed him looking and tilted her head quizzically. Her hair decoration swayed
        <p></p>rhythmically with her graceful movements.
        <p></p>"Is the sweet red bean soup any good?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"It's delicious," she said, nodding.
        <p></p>"Could I try some?"
        <p></p>Mahiru looked startled by his question. It was almost comical how quickly she
        <p></p>straightened up.
        <p></p>"Ah, s-sure you can, but…"
        <p></p>She couldn't hide how flustered she was, glancing up at him timidly.
        <p></p>"If you don't want me to, it's fine…"
        <p></p>"It's… it's not that I don't want you to, but… well—"
        <p></p>"Well?"
        <p></p>"N-no, nothing, it's fine. Here. Could I have some of your sake, too?"
        <p></p>"S-sure."
        <p></p>Mahiru quickly seized his cup. She seemed suddenly very agitated for some reason.
        <p></p>Amane accepted her cup of red bean soup.
        <p></p>In it was a thick liquid that was certainly bean-colored.
        <p></p>When he brought the cup to his lips, the unique fragrance of sweet red beans wafted
        <p></p>gently over him and filled his nose as a rich flavor spread over his tongue. Amane
        <p></p>didn't have much of a sweet tooth, so even the slight sweetness of the bean soup
        <p></p>seemed strong to him.
        <p></p>It was delicious and vividly brought to mind thoughts of how well sweet red bean
        <p></p>paste paired with bitter green tea.
        <p></p>Since Mahiru seemed to have a thing for sweets, he thought this soup was probably
        <p></p>just perfect for her tastes.
        <p></p>When he glanced over at Mahiru, perhaps because she had sipped the sweet sake, her
        <p></p>cheeks were slightly flushed. She looked almost anxious.
        <p></p>"You don't like it?"
        <p></p>"That's not it… Amane, you made such a big deal out of sharing a piece of cake. Why
        <p></p>doesn't this bother you?"
        <p></p>"…Ah."
        <p></p>That was when he realized why Mahiru had reacted the way she did. Amane froze in
        <p></p>place.
        <p></p>We're not feeding each other, but I guess this is still an indirect kiss, huh?
        <p></p>His attention had been focused on the sweet red bean soup, and he had inadvertently
        <p></p>suggested that they share an indirect kiss. He may not have realized it, but there could
        <p></p>be no doubt that he had put Mahiru on the spot. That must have been why she had
        <p></p>acted the way she had.
        <p></p>"S-sorry. That was really thoughtless. I'm sure you hated it…"
        <p></p>"Wh-why are you always like that, Amane? I was just… I was embarrassed, okay? That
        <p></p>was all."
        <p></p>"I— I'll be more careful in the future. Sorry."
        <p></p>Whatever she might have been feeling, it was a fact that he had put her on the spot.
        <p></p>Amane bowed his head slightly, and Mahiru waved her hand in front of her face
        <p></p>frantically.
        <p></p>"R-really, I'm not worried about it!"
        <p></p>"Are you sure? Well, I'm sorry anyway. I shouldn't treat you the same way as my other
        <p></p>friends."
        <p></p>Itsuki and Chitose were the type of people who didn't care about that stuff and would
        <p></p>take sips of Amane's drinks and bites of his food and insist it was fine because they
        <p></p>were friends.
        <p></p>Itsuki was the same sex as Amane, and Chitose was the opposite sex, but he had never
        <p></p>looked at either of them with the slightest romantic interest, so it didn't really feel like
        <p></p>an indirect kiss when they shared food. He just got irritated when they stole his snacks.
        <p></p>But with Mahiru, it was obviously different. He was in the wrong for not realizing that
        <p></p>sooner.
        <p></p>"Do Itsuki and Chitose usually do things like that?"
        <p></p>"Y-yeah, I mean, we're friends, after all…"
        <p></p>"Is that so?"
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded, wearing a complex expression that could have been either
        <p></p>comprehension or consternation. Then she lowered her gaze back down to the sweet
        <p></p>sake and raised the cup to her lips again.
        <p></p>"…I suppose, Amane, that you and I are friends, too, so it's fine."
        <p></p>"Y-yeah… but you drank it all, didn't you?"
        <p></p>Mahiru's cheeks flushed even though there was no alcohol in the drink. "Th-there
        <p></p>wasn't much left!" She turned away sharply.
        <p></p>In retaliation, Amane gulped down what was left of Mahiru's sweet red bean soup.
        <p></p>He'd expected it to have gotten cold, but it was somehow still hot and seemed even
        <p></p>sweeter than before.
        <p></p>"Mahiru dear, you're such a good cook!"
        <p></p>By the time they made it back from the shrine visit, it was already evening. Mahiru had
        <p></p>changed clothes and begun her usual dinner preparations, but… Amane's mother
        <p></p>Shihoko was also in the kitchen, ostensibly to observe Mahiru's culinary skills.
        <p></p>His parents had decided to spend the night. Their house was several hours away by
        <p></p>car, and they were tired. It sounded like they had been intending to stay over from the
        <p></p>outset. Amane wished that they'd asked the guy living there first, but his father
        <p></p>technically owned the apartment, so he knew he had no right to complain.
        <p></p>Luckily, he had an extra futon set just in case he ever had anyone over, so he figured
        <p></p>they could share it. They slept in the same bed at home, so it wouldn't be that different.
        <p></p>"Thank you very much," Mahiru said graciously.
        <p></p>"Really, you're very good for a high school girl. When I was your age, there's no way I
        <p></p>could have done all this."
        <p></p>"Your cooking's no match for Mahiru's now, Mom."
        <p></p>"Did you say something, dear?"
        <p></p>"Not a thing."
        <p></p>A low-pitched voice had come flying out of the kitchen at him, so Amane feigned
        <p></p>innocence and huddled against the sofa. His father was relaxing on the couch next to
        <p></p>him and chided, "Now, Amane, don't pick on your mother."
        <p></p>But she was always picking on him, so he felt like this was a fair turnabout.
        <p></p>Amane could hear his mother chatting with Mahiru in a cheerful voice.
        <p></p>Mahiru calmly kept up with her, unfazed by her intense energy and attention. She
        <p></p>seemed to be getting used to the high-strung woman.
        <p></p>Watching from afar, Amane gazed at the two of them preparing dinner and apparently
        <p></p>getting along well, and he let out a quiet sigh of relief.
        <p></p>"Your mother seems to have taken quite a liking to Miss Shiina, hasn't she?"
        <p></p>Amane's father was gazing at the two of them in the same way, and he looked pleased.
        <p></p>"Well, she's beautiful and sweet and has a nice personality, so I'm not surprised that
        <p></p>Mom likes her."
        <p></p>"How about you, Amane?"
        <p></p>"…Oh, I mean, I think she's a nice person, and I think she's cute."
        <p></p>"I see."
        <p></p>It seemed like a casual question, but Amane's father wasn't the type of person to pry
        <p></p>too much, so he had probably asked out of genuine curiosity. He didn't press Amane
        <p></p>on his answer any further.
        <p></p>"I'm looking forward to trying this food that you enjoy every day, Amane."
        <p></p>"I can vouch for the taste. If Mom doesn't meddle too much, that is."
        <p></p>"You don't need to worry. Shihoko was the one who wanted to eat Miss Shiina's
        <p></p>cooking, so I'm sure the most she'll do is help out a little."
        <p></p>"That's good, if it's true."
        <p></p>His mother wasn't a bad cook, but most of her dishes featured big, bold flavors, in
        <p></p>contrast to Mahiru's subtle seasonings. Delicate flavors were his father's specialty
        <p></p>while his mother favored quantity and ease of preparation.
        <p></p>Of course, that was important for a housewife who had a growing boy's appetite to
        <p></p>satisfy, but Amane actually preferred the carefully calibrated flavors of the dishes
        <p></p>Mahiru made. He shuddered to think of anyone meddling with Mahiru's exquisite
        <p></p>seasonings.
        <p></p>Thankfully, his mother seemed to be constraining herself to being Mahiru's assistant
        <p></p>like his father said, so he breathed a sigh of relief and continued watching the two of
        <p></p>them cook.
        <p></p>"Oh yes, this is very good," Amane's father said.
        <p></p>There was no way that the four of them would have fit around Amane's two-person
        <p></p>dining table, so he had pulled out the large folding desk that had been shut away in
        <p></p>the storage room to use for dinner.
        <p></p>"Thank you very much." Mahiru looked relieved at Shuuto's frank assessment, and she
        <p></p>visibly relaxed a little.
        <p></p>Apparently, she had never let anyone other than Amane eat her home cooking, outside
        <p></p>of home-ec class in school, of course, and had been somewhat nervous about it… but
        <p></p>at last that stiffness melted away once she saw Shuuto's gentle smile.
        <p></p>"It's really delicious," Amane's mother added. "If she can cook like this, she won't have
        <p></p>any trouble living alone—or getting married."
        <p></p>Shihoko muttered quietly to herself while looking at Amane. He could feel his cheek
        <p></p>about to twitch but forcibly maintained a neutral expression and sipped his miso soup.
        <p></p>The rich, dashi-infused flavor was now very familiar to him. He had really gotten used
        <p></p>to the way Mahiru prepared her dishes and, after eating her cooking every day, had
        <p></p>practically lost all desire to eat anything else.
        <p></p>"Amane, what do you think?" his mother asked.
        <p></p>"It's delicious, of course. Thanks for always cooking, Mahiru."
        <p></p>He had been planning to say as much anyway. But now that his mother had prompted
        <p></p>him, it probably sounded like he didn't really mean it. Amane had never forgotten to
        <p></p>tell Mahiru that her cooking was delicious every day when they ate together, but since
        <p></p>his parents were here, he had been holding back. And that had obviously been the
        <p></p>wrong decision.
        <p></p>His gratitude was no different now, but for some reason, Mahiru was restless, fidgeting
        <p></p>uncomfortably. "…Sure," she answered in a quiet voice. Her cheeks were flushed
        <p></p>slightly.
        <p></p>It was probably because his parents were there. There could be no doubt that Mahiru
        <p></p>was feeling bashful, even if only a little. She was used to hearing Amane's appraisals
        <p></p>of her cooking, but now three people had complimented her.
        <p></p>"You're awfully cute, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"Shihoko, don't tease."
        <p></p>"That's not what I meant! I was just thinking that she's a good, upstanding girl, which
        <p></p>is so hard to find these days."
        <p></p>"Th-that's… It's not really…"
        <p></p>"Yeah, I can agree with that. Mahiru's like, really pure, you could say."
        <p></p>"Amane?!"
        <p></p>Mahiru was definitely a little naive. Her face had gone bright red once just from seeing
        <p></p>a guy—a not particularly attractive guy—with the front of his shirt open.
        <p></p>"My, my, did something happen between you two while we weren't looking?"
        <p></p>"Nope."
        <p></p>"Nothing happened."
        <p></p>The denial practically leaped from Mahiru's mouth.
        <p></p>Being innocent or naive wasn't the worst thing in the world, but Mahiru seemed to
        <p></p>hate being called those things. Amane had no plans to say anything further.
        <p></p>"Well, I think that they should do just as they please, as long as Amane isn't hurting
        <p></p>Miss Shiina, that is," Amane's father said. "Just don't tease her too much, Amane."
        <p></p>"I know that much."
        <p></p>"…Well, weren't you just teasing her?"
        <p></p>"Hey, it was an accurate description—"
        <p></p>Amane felt something strike his thigh below the table. Mahiru's face was bright red,
        <p></p>and she was glaring in his direction.
        <p></p>"Sorry, sorry," he said.
        <p></p>A sullen expression crossed her handsome features. But that only made her look even
        <p></p>more adorable, and Amane couldn't help but grin. He only hoped that Mahiru wouldn't
        <p></p>stay mad at him for long.
        <p></p>"…You know, I can't help but feel a bit like we're looking in the mirror. What do you
        <p></p>think, Shihoko darling?"
        <p></p>"I think that's just fine, Shuuto dear. Why, even our Amane is wearing an
        <p></p>uncharacteristically gentle expression."
        <p></p>"What are you guys talking about over there?"
        <p></p>"Not a thing, dear!"
        <p></p>Amane could have sworn that he heard some low, conspiratorial whispers from across
        <p></p>the table, but his parents maintained expressions of perfect innocence.
        <p></p>"Sorry you had to make enough for my parents, too."
        <p></p>After they had finished dinner and chatted pleasantly for another couple of hours, it
        <p></p>was finally time to break up the party.
        <p></p>Of course, since Amane's parents would be sleeping in his living room, Mahiru was the
        <p></p>only one going home.
        <p></p>Amane had sent his parents to bathe, so he was the only one who stepped outside to
        <p></p>see Mahiru off.
        <p></p>There was no need for him to do so, but he wanted the chance to apologize for his
        <p></p>mother and father, just in case.
        <p></p>"No, it's all right. This was fun."
        <p></p>"It was?"
        <p></p>He was glad that she didn't appear upset.
        <p></p>If anything, she seemed like she had enjoyed herself.
        <p></p>"Besides—"
        <p></p>"Yeah?"
        <p></p>"…I got a small taste of happiness, so—"
        <p></p>Mahiru's thin voice was almost like a sigh. She smiled but also looked very lonely all
        <p></p>of a sudden. It was a fleeting smile, one that seemed like it could be carried away by
        <p></p>the breeze. Amane was starting to piece together a picture of her situation at home, so
        <p></p>he thought he recognized the faint look of yearning in her eyes.
        <p></p>Somehow, he couldn't leave it alone, and Amane put his palm on her head and stroked
        <p></p>her hair.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked up at Amane in surprise, but she didn't seem to hate it.
        <p></p>"Wh-what are you doing?"
        <p></p>"Nothing."
        <p></p>"It's not nothing… My hair's all messed up."
        <p></p>"You're getting in the bath anyway, right?"
        <p></p>"I am, but—"
        <p></p>"…Did you hate it?"
        <p></p>"I—I didn't hate it, but… you could at least say something first."
        <p></p>"…Here we go."
        <p></p>"That's saying something after."
        <p></p>So it's okay to touch you as long as I tell you first? Amane thought, but he knew better
        <p></p>than to say it out loud.
        <p></p>"Sorry."
        <p></p>Mahiru let out a small sigh.
        <p></p>"Geez… I'm fine with it, but it's really not appropriate to rub a girl's head so casually."
        <p></p>"But I don't do it to anyone else…"
        <p></p>Amane understood that the only time it was okay to touch a person of the opposite
        <p></p>sex was when you had a close relationship. He wasn't the kind of guy who would go
        <p></p>around casually rubbing up against girls or anything. The closest he came to that was
        <p></p>smacking Chitose whenever she made a terrible joke.
        <p></p>Amane had thought that maybe he and Mahiru had gotten close enough, so he had
        <p></p>tentatively touched her, hoping she wouldn't hate it, but the thought wouldn't have
        <p></p>even occurred to him if it was anyone else.
        <p></p>Mahiru had fallen quiet, but she hadn't shaken off his hand.
        <p></p>"…I'm sure you can see it," she said, "but you're the spitting image of your father,
        <p></p>Amane. It's obvious to me, even though I've only known him a short while."
        <p></p>"In what sense? I really don't think I resemble him that much, either physically or with
        <p></p>my personality."
        <p></p>"…You're exactly like him. Truly."
        <p></p>Mahiru sighed more heavily this time, and Amane rubbed her head again. She still
        <p></p>didn't seem to be against it.
        <p></p>…Do I really resemble him that much?
        <p></p>Sure, they had once or twice been mistaken for brothers far apart in age, but Amane
        <p></p>felt like he had a completely different energy from his father. Their personalities, too,
        <p></p>while not exact opposites, nevertheless were quite different.
        <p></p>What could she have meant by saying that he was just like his father, despite such clear
        <p></p>differences?
        <p></p>Any number of doubts welled up in Amane's mind, but Mahiru must not have intended
        <p></p>to say anything further. Her eyes narrowed a bit, and she left the matter alone.
        <p></p>After stroking her hair a bit more, Amane pulled back, and Mahiru seemed to suddenly
        <p></p>snap back to her senses. She peered up at Amane, slightly flustered.
        <p></p>"What, you wanted me to keep going?" he asked teasingly.
        <p></p>Mahiru flushed red again. "Please don't mock me," she said quietly, so he decided to
        <p></p>call it a day.
        <p></p>Apparently, she was in a bad mood now, for she made no attempt to hide the
        <p></p>displeasure on her face as she opened the door to her own apartment and slipped
        <p></p>inside.
        <p></p>For a brief moment, Amane regretted his actions, wondering if he had overdone it a
        <p></p>little, when Mahiru cracked her door open and peeked out at him.
        <p></p>"Amane."
        <p></p>Her cheeks were still pink, and her voice sounded peevish but with a slight fawning
        <p></p>tone to it somehow.
        <p></p>"What?"
        <p></p>"…You're a dummy."
        <p></p>Just as suddenly, Mahiru shut the door.
        <p></p>…Well, that makes two of us, I guess.
        <p></p>Wasn't it Mahiru's fault that his heart was suddenly leaping in his chest?
        <p></p>Amane sighed quietly, then leaned against the wall of the unheated corridor, trying to
        <p></p>let the sudden burning in his chest cool a bit. That was the moment he noticed he could
        <p></p>see his breath in the frosty air.
        <p></p>A short while after Amane had said goodnight to Mahiru and returned to his apartment,
        <p></p>his parents finished their bath. When Amane looked up from the TV toward the sound
        <p></p>of approaching slippers, he saw them standing there in their nightclothes, casually
        <p></p>holding hands.
        <p></p>Well, I guess that comes naturally if you've already taken a bath together.
        <p></p>"We've had our bath, Amane. It's your turn."
        <p></p>"Sure… Wait, how did you two manage to both fit in my tub? It's only big enough for
        <p></p>one."
        <p></p>For someone living alone, this was quite a spacious, well-designed apartment, but that
        <p></p>didn't mean the bathtub was especially large. It certainly wasn't big enough for a fullgrown man and woman to sit together comfortably.
        <p></p>"Oh no, it's fine! There's no problem if you get in close together. Right, Shuuto dear?"
        <p></p>His mother smiled and drew closer to her husband, and his father nodded in agreement
        <p></p>with a gentle smile. They had already been married for nearly twenty years, but the
        <p></p>two of them still acted like newlyweds. Amane could do nothing but smile bitterly.
        <p></p>"As loving as always, I see."
        <p></p>"Are you jealous?"
        <p></p>"Not really. I can relax better in the bath alone anyway."
        <p></p>"What about Mahiru…?"
        <p></p>"All right, listen up. Nothing is going on with her."
        <p></p>He didn't understand why his mother wanted so badly to hook him up with Mahiru.
        <p></p>Well, it wasn't a total mystery, since she'd been joking about wanting Mahiru for a
        <p></p>daughter-in-law since the day they'd met, but Amane was certain his mother had
        <p></p>mistaken the trust that Mahiru had in Amane for romantic affection.
        <p></p>"Is that so?"
        <p></p>"Now, now, Shihoko. Amane's at a delicate age, so let's be considerate."
        <p></p>"But I'm being serious…"
        <p></p>"Whatever you say, Mom."
        <p></p>Amane paid his mother's words no mind as he stood up to get ready for his bath, but
        <p></p>he stopped when his father called his name.
        <p></p>"Amane." He used a serious tone, not the voice he used to chide his wife or the one that
        <p></p>he had when he smiled. When Amane looked at him, wondering what was the matter,
        <p></p>he was met with a soft but firm gaze.
        <p></p>"Amane, are you glad you moved here?"
        <p></p>Though he was caught by surprise, after a moment Amane quickly met his father's
        <p></p>steady gaze with an easy smile.
        <p></p>"…Yeah, I am. Life got easier."
        <p></p>Surely his parents must have been worried about him. Worried enough to frequently
        <p></p>come check on how he was doing and worried enough to try to see him at every
        <p></p>opportunity.
        <p></p>All of it had been in order to make sure that Amane was living comfortably.
        <p></p>"Is that so? I'm glad."
        <p></p>"You don't need to worry; there's someone here who I can really rely on."
        <p></p>Unlike before—
        <p></p>He swallowed those words and kept his answer simple and clean.
        <p></p>His mother smiled brightly. "Oh, you must mean little Itsuki! I've never met him in
        <p></p>person, so I wanted to go say hello, since we came all this way."
        <p></p>"Give it a rest, please; you're going to start something weird."
        <p></p>"It's not weird at all. I'll tell him how cute you were when you were little, and…"
        <p></p>"See, that's exactly what I'm talking about. Seriously, just stop…"
        <p></p>If this spilled over to Itsuki, then it was certain to reach Chitose as well. That was the
        <p></p>one thing Amane wanted to avoid no matter what. He did not want to deal with her
        <p></p>endless teasing or put up with her badgering him for old photos from his past.
        <p></p>Amane had looked remarkably like a cute little girl when he was small, and it didn't
        <p></p>help that his mother sometimes even dressed him up in girls' clothes. If photographic
        <p></p>evidence of that got out, his life would be nothing but suffering.
        <p></p>"But I can't help wanting to say hello, can I? He's such good friends with you, Amane."
        <p></p>"That's true, but—"
        <p></p>"I bet he's a really good boy, isn't he? He's got the Amane seal of approval, after all."
        <p></p>"…He's a good guy. So good that he's wasted on me."
        <p></p>It wasn't something he would ever say to Itsuki's face, but Amane always appreciated
        <p></p>his friend who once took the initiative to call out in a friendly voice to a very gloomy
        <p></p>boy who never interacted with anyone and just sat quietly on the side of the classroom
        <p></p>listening to music.
        <p></p>"I'm going to take a bath."
        <p></p>He felt embarrassed after openly praising Itsuki, even though he wasn't there, and to
        <p></p>disguise his discomfort, he quickly headed for his bedroom to retrieve a change of
        <p></p>clothes.
        <p></p>He could hear a small chuckle behind his back, compelling Amane to escape to his
        <p></p>room, scowling and muttering the whole way.
        <p></p>The following morning, when Amane went out into the living room after waking up
        <p></p>and dressing, he found his parents already up and food on the table.
        <p></p>"Good morning. Breakfast is ready, so have a seat."
        <p></p>Amane sat down at the table, smiling slightly at his father, who called to him from the
        <p></p>kitchen, wearing Amane's apron, which had been draped over a chair.
        <p></p>He had only just arrived in this apartment and had already made himself comfortable
        <p></p>in an unfamiliar kitchen, probably because he was so used to doing the cooking. At
        <p></p>home, Amane's parents took turns preparing meals, so Amane was also used to seeing
        <p></p>his father in an apron, and there was nothing unusual about it.
        <p></p>Amane's mother was already waiting impatiently at the table. She probably wanted to
        <p></p>help, but his father had likely insisted that she leave it to him.
        <p></p>Amane also considered helping and got as far as standing up from his seat only to see
        <p></p>his father bring out steaming hot rice and miso soup on a tray, immediately taking the
        <p></p>wind out of Amane's sails.
        <p></p>"Thanks, Dad."
        <p></p>"Don't mention it. Anyway, Miss Shiina was kind enough to pack yesterday's leftovers
        <p></p>into containers, so I just heated that up, cooked some rice, then made miso soup and
        <p></p>rolled omelets."
        <p></p>Eat a proper breakfast was practically a motto in the Fujimiya household, so they never
        <p></p>skipped their morning meal.
        <p></p>Amane's father had happily incorporated the leftovers into the menu, but if they hadn't
        <p></p>had them, there was little doubt he would have whipped up something.
        <p></p>With a smile, Shuuto placed the rice and miso soup in front of each of them.
        <p></p>Amane's attention was drawn to his father's rolled omelets, which he hadn't tasted in
        <p></p>a while, and before he knew it, the table was set, and his father had taken his own seat.
        <p></p>"All right, let's get to it, shall we?"
        <p></p>"Certainly. Thank you, dear."
        <p></p>"Thanks for the meal."
        <p></p>Everyone expressed their gratitude, and then Amane reached with his chopsticks for
        <p></p>the rolled omelets in front of him.
        <p></p>This was the first time Amane had eaten his father's cooking since he went home for
        <p></p>summer break, so he was looking forward to the nostalgia of it as he took his first bite
        <p></p>and slowly chewed.
        <p></p>The flavor of the dashi, the hint of sweetness, the slightly undercooked egg—it tasted
        <p></p>like home—yet at the same time, Amane found something slightly lacking.
        <p></p>"Is something the matter?"
        <p></p>His father seemed to have noticed Amane chewing with a serious expression and
        <p></p>sounded concerned.
        <p></p>"Mm… no, it's nothing."
        <p></p>"Did I maybe mess up the seasonings?"
        <p></p>"N-no, that's not it; it's good, but… I was just thinking that the flavor is different from
        <p></p>the way that Mahiru always makes omelets."
        <p></p>"Ah, so that's it."
        <p></p>He hadn't eaten his father's cooking for almost half a year, so even though it should
        <p></p>have been familiar, he was actually more accustomed to Mahiru's cooking after eating
        <p></p>it every day. Even Amane was surprised.
        <p></p>Of course, that wasn't to say that his father's cooking was bad or anything, just that
        <p></p>Mahiru's seasonings were more to Amane's tastes. But even so, he felt somewhat selfconscious about the fact that his tongue had adapted so well to Mahiru's cooking,
        <p></p>when he had only met her a few months earlier.
        <p></p>"You've really fallen for Miss Shiina, haven't you?" his father asked.
        <p></p>"For her cooking, yeah."
        <p></p>"Hey, now," his mother crowed. "Are you saying you're not interested in Mahiru herself,
        <p></p>then?"
        <p></p>"No one is saying that, and I do not intend to fall for such a leading question."
        <p></p>Amane was not about to let his mother steer the conversation in that direction again.
        <p></p>Shihoko frowned—obviously, her aim had been exactly as Amane expected. Amane
        <p></p>snorted through his nose and refused to take the bait.
        <p></p>His parents departed before lunch.
        <p></p>Both of them apparently had work the next day, so Amane had suggested that it would
        <p></p>be hard on them if they didn't get home early and rest. They had a long drive ahead of
        <p></p>them, which would of course be exhausting, so it was better if they hurried up and got
        <p></p>going.
        <p></p>"But I wanted to talk more with my dear Mahiru and meet Itsuki…," his mother
        <p></p>muttered quietly after stepping out the door into the building's hallway.
        <p></p>"Then do that stuff next time… Besides, you'll have to make an appointment to see
        <p></p>Itsuki. He doesn't have a lot of free time."
        <p></p>"All right, you set it up for me then, Amane."
        <p></p>"If I feel like it."
        <p></p>It was obvious to everyone that Amane had no intention of doing anything of the sort.
        <p></p>His mother grew sullen, but Amane's father soothed her—and more or less restored
        <p></p>her good spirits.
        <p></p>As Amane was watching his parents, the door to the next-door apartment quietly
        <p></p>creaked open. From the narrow crack, he could see a flash of golden hair and Mahiru's
        <p></p>face peeking out.
        <p></p>She must have come out because she had heard his mother talking. For better or
        <p></p>worse, his mother's voice traveled quite well.
        <p></p>"Oh, perfect, I was just thinking about coming to say good-bye!"
        <p></p>Both of Amane's parents noticed Mahiru and moved over to stand in front of her
        <p></p>apartment as she slipped on a pair of shoes and stepped out into the hallway. Amane's
        <p></p>mother was wearing a big smile and seemed determined to get as close to Mahiru as
        <p></p>possible. Mahiru shrunk back but didn't retreat entirely.
        <p></p>"Are you two leaving already?"
        <p></p>"I wish we weren't. Really, we'd like to stay another day or two, but we have work."
        <p></p>"Things would be different if we had come up a little bit earlier, but… this is all the
        <p></p>time we have."
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled placidly at Amane's parents.
        <p></p>"Well, there's always next time," his mother said. "Although, next time it's Amane's turn
        <p></p>to come to us."
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah. I'll be home for summer vacation."
        <p></p>Amane could feel his mother's gaze bearing down on him. He knew right away she was
        <p></p>hoping that he would bring Mahiru along with him.
        <p></p>Still, he couldn't help but wonder if that might be a good idea. She apparently spent
        <p></p>her school breaks alone, after all. Maybe she wouldn't be so opposed to the idea, he
        <p></p>thought idly.
        <p></p>"You really have no charm at all, Amane," his mother said. "Isn't that right, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Uh, I… I'm not sure how to—"
        <p></p>"Come now, Shihoko, don't put her on the spot," Amane's father chided. "…Though, it's
        <p></p>true that Amane has gotten less up front about various things as he's gotten older,
        <p></p>hasn't he?"
        <p></p>Amane had no allies here, so he silently pretended to ignore his parents. Shuuto
        <p></p>turned to Mahiru with a gentle smile that was different than Shihoko's.
        <p></p>"As you can see, our Amane has a hard time expressing his feelings, but if you look
        <p></p>closely, you can tell that he's a kindhearted young man. I would be very happy if you
        <p></p>would continue to be a good friend to him."
        <p></p>"Ugh, I'm right here, you know. This is so embarrassing…"
        <p></p>His father had praised him, but Amane felt more like he had been goaded by an enemy
        <p></p>than supported by an ally.
        <p></p>He certainly didn't think of himself as a particularly kindhearted person. He just
        <p></p>showed the people close to him the respect and affection he thought they deserved. It
        <p></p>felt wrong to have that confused with kindness.
        <p></p>Awkwardly trying to find anywhere else to look, Amane glanced over at Mahiru and
        <p></p>saw her blink quickly and smile.
        <p></p>"…I've always thought that Amane is an honest and kind person. So much so that I'm
        <p></p>the one who should be asking for his continued friendship."
        <p></p>"Well, that's wonderful. That puts my mind at ease."
        <p></p>Amane wanted to make a quip about his father's mind being at ease, but he was so
        <p></p>shaken by what Mahiru had said that he couldn't think of anything. It was so
        <p></p>embarrassing to hear her describe him that way. He couldn't even look at her.
        <p></p>His mother laughed as she watched him squirm, but Amane couldn't even respond. He
        <p></p>could only bite his lip in tortured silence.
        <p></p>"You don't really need to flatter me, you know."
        <p></p>After Amane's parents had finally departed, he spoke to Mahiru in a quiet voice as they
        <p></p>stood alone in the hallway.
        <p></p>Amane had made that remark to relieve the awkward atmosphere somewhat, but for
        <p></p>some reason, Mahiru raised her eyebrows and stared at him.
        <p></p>Her expression was calm, but there was a subtle edge to it that he found intimidating.
        <p></p>"Do I seem like the type to say empty words I don't mean?"
        <p></p>"Well, you wouldn't lie to me—but maybe in front of my parents?"
        <p></p>She seemed to object to him calling it flattery.
        <p></p>Mahiru huffed and then let out a sigh of exasperation.
        <p></p>"…Now see here, I trust you because I think you have a good heart, and I really do like
        <p></p>spending time with you. I promise: I was not trying to flatter you."
        <p></p>"O-oh…"
        <p></p>Amane felt the heat rushing to his face. Hearing her talk so candidly was terribly
        <p></p>embarrassing. Fortunately, Mahiru did not seem to notice his unease, and he nodded
        <p></p>meekly.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed satisfied. "As long as you understand. Well, I suppose I'll get started on
        <p></p>lunch."
        <p></p>Apparently, Mahiru was going to fix him lunch today, just as she had done every day of
        <p></p>the New Year's holiday. Feeling a mixture of gratitude and shame, Amane looked down
        <p></p>at Mahiru's golden hair as she placed a hand on the door to his apartment.
        <p></p>Someone she can trust, huh…? That's what I was gonna say.
        <p></p>Mahiru ignored the fact that Amane thought she was an angel. To her, he was an
        <p></p>ordinary neighbor. But she trusted him. That was what he was most grateful for.
        <p></p>"I'm so glad I moved here."
        <p></p>Mahiru must have heard his quiet mumbling, because she turned around and asked,
        <p></p>"Did you say something?"
        <p></p>"No, nothing," Amane said quickly, following her into his apartment.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 19: A New Semester 
        <p></p>A new school semester had started, but not much had changed.
        <p></p>Everyone seemed to have spent the winter vacation relaxing, so there weren't any
        <p></p>major developments the way summer vacation could sometimes bring. The usual cast
        <p></p>of characters was back, and no one had undergone a drastic image change or anything.
        <p></p>Amane was seated at his desk, quietly gazing at a classroom that was somewhat more
        <p></p>boisterous than usual, when a shadow loomed over him.
        <p></p>"Yo, Amane, what's good."
        <p></p>"Thanks, can't complain."
        <p></p>It was Itsuki, who had entered the classroom from behind Amane's seat. Itsuki was no
        <p></p>exception and had also remained the same.
        <p></p>Amane hadn't seen him since Christmas, but he was wearing the same flippant smile
        <p></p>as always.
        <p></p>"So did you have a good holiday?"
        <p></p>"…P-pretty much, yeah."
        <p></p>"C'mon, you're holding something back. Was there some kind of… progress?"
        <p></p>"What? Look, it's not like that. And just so you know, nothing happened."
        <p></p>That wasn't actually true, of course. But Amane wouldn't dream of telling Itsuki that
        <p></p>Mahiru had stayed over at his place, even if it had been an accident.
        <p></p>He knew the moment he told Itsuki, Itsuki was guaranteed to tell Chitose, and it wasn't
        <p></p>hard to imagine that the two of them would start teasing and poking fun at him first
        <p></p>chance they got.
        <p></p>Aside from that incident, all that had happened over the break was his parents coming
        <p></p>over and their communal visit to the shrine, which surely fell into the category of
        <p></p>nothing.
        <p></p>"…Hmm?"
        <p></p>"I didn't really do anything."
        <p></p>"Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but…"
        <p></p>Amane found Itsuki's rather triumphant smile pretty irritating but decided that
        <p></p>responding would just encourage him, so he let it go.
        <p></p>He looked around the classroom, hunting for some topic that would let him change
        <p></p>the subject… but nothing was particularly new or notable.
        <p></p>As always, the girls were standing around Yuuta Kadowaki, the so-called prince of their
        <p></p>grade. As always, the boys in the room were openly jealous, even though Yuuta himself
        <p></p>wore a slightly troubled expression.
        <p></p>"That dynamic hasn't changed one bit," Amane remarked.
        <p></p>"Yeah, good ol' Yuuta. Same old spectacle, huh?"
        <p></p>In the end, Amane, who considered it none of his business, and Itsuki, who had a
        <p></p>girlfriend and wasn't interested in other girls, smiled wryly at Yuuta's popularity and
        <p></p>continued scanning their familiar surroundings.
        <p></p>"Come to think of it, I heard that Shiina might have a boyfriend, you know."
        <p></p>A group of several girls formed nearby, and Amane could hear what they were talking
        <p></p>about. He suddenly stiffened.
        <p></p>"Oh, Risa told me, yeah. She went on a shrine visit and saw her holding hands with a
        <p></p>boy."
        <p></p>"Yeah, I heard! Shiina has never been swayed by anyone before, but maybe that was
        <p></p>because she had a boyfriend?"
        <p></p>"Sounds like he was a really cool-looking guy, but Risa said she's never seen him
        <p></p>before. He must be from another school."
        <p></p>Somehow, it felt like the attention of the whole classroom shifted to the girls'
        <p></p>conversation. Even Yuuta seemed to be looking over and perking up his ears.
        <p></p>Only Itsuki was looking at Amane.
        <p></p>"Hey, Amane."
        <p></p>"I know nothing."
        <p></p>"I didn't even ask you anything yet."
        <p></p>"I'm not involved."
        <p></p>"Sure."
        <p></p>Itsuki smiled knowingly at Amane, who had shut him down in a quiet voice, then
        <p></p>flicked Amane's bangs up and out of the way.
        <p></p>"Say, you always hide your face, but it's not too shabby."
        <p></p>"I can't take that as anything but mockery when you say it."
        <p></p>Itsuki could be a real prankster, and he never seemed to take much of anything
        <p></p>seriously, and he was definitely a good-looking guy himself, so when he told Amane
        <p></p>that he had an attractive face, it sounded decidedly sarcastic.
        <p></p>Amane knew he was an average-looking guy at best, and it made him uncomfortable
        <p></p>to hear other people talking about his appearance.
        <p></p>He slapped Itsuki's hand away from his bangs and scowled, but his friend only grinned.
        <p></p>"That's just the sort of guy you are."
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>"Well, can't say it's out of character."
        <p></p>Amane was still acting cold, and Itsuki grinned at him without even a hint of anger.
        <p></p>"There's a rumor going around school."
        <p></p>They were still seated across from each other at the dining table after dinner when he
        <p></p>shared the news, and Mahiru's face stiffened, as if she already knew exactly what he
        <p></p>was talking about.
        <p></p>Mahiru was sure to have the most trouble from the situation.
        <p></p>As far as Amane could tell from what he'd heard, he had yet to be identified as the
        <p></p>mystery man, but even so, it must have been exhausting, having everyone suddenly
        <p></p>asking her about having a boyfriend.
        <p></p>That must have been why Mahiru was moving stiffly and stepping just a little wearily
        <p></p>when she came over to Amane's apartment that day.
        <p></p>"…It's all right, because no one knows that it was you, Amane, but everyone's really
        <p></p>taken it the wrong way. This is going to be a difficult misunderstanding to clear up."
        <p></p>"Is holding your hand enough to turn someone into your boyfriend?"
        <p></p>"I don't know. For the time being, I've been strongly denying everything, telling people
        <p></p>that the boy was just an acquaintance. Now we have to wait for the rumor to die down."
        <p></p>"Mm, well, I guess there's nothing else we can do, huh?"
        <p></p>Obviously, people would think less of Mahiru if they thought that she was dating a guy
        <p></p>like Amane, so he hoped that the rumors would burn out quickly. She was clearly
        <p></p>stressed, having person after person question her about a maybe-boyfriend.
        <p></p>At the same time, Amane felt an uneasy tinge of regret and embarrassment whenever
        <p></p>he heard the rumors circulating, so he also wanted to put the whole thing behind them.
        <p></p>Amane sighed heavily, while Mahiru just quietly cast her eyes downward.
        <p></p>"…Did we really look that much like sweethearts?" Mahiru suddenly asked.
        <p></p>"I wonder. To be honest, I can't really see you ever going out with a guy like me. You'd
        <p></p>definitely go for a smarter, more attractive guy, so I think even if I saw us standing side
        <p></p>by side, I'd assume we were simply acquaintances rather than boyfriend and
        <p></p>girlfriend."
        <p></p>"That's not true."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had answered him in a stronger voice than expected. When he turned to look
        <p></p>at her again, she was not wearing the worried face she'd been making earlier. Instead,
        <p></p>for some reason, Mahiru seemed a little… angry. She had a determined look about her.
        <p></p>"Amane, your assessment of yourself is quite low, but it's not accurate. I think that
        <p></p>you're a very well-balanced person. You're kind and considerate and gentlemanly, so I
        <p></p>think you've got a very good personality. And when you got all dressed up, I think you
        <p></p>looked really nice, too."
        <p></p>Her words were far too kind. Amane could scarcely believe that she was talking about
        <p></p>him. His face began to turn bright red. He never would have imagined that Mahiru
        <p></p>thought so highly of him, and she was saying these things so earnestly that it made
        <p></p>him feel awkward to be on the receiving end of her praise.
        <p></p>Apparently, he was not the only one feeling a bit awkward. Midway through, Mahiru's
        <p></p>voice had begun to tremble, but she still looked Amane directly in the eye, making sure
        <p></p>that he fully understood that this was her honest opinion. Of course, that didn't make
        <p></p>it any less embarrassing.
        <p></p>"Oh r-really…? Um, o-okay, thanks."
        <p></p>"S-so, um, well… don't put yourself down so much."
        <p></p>"Y-yeah…"
        <p></p>Amane didn't feel any urge to argue with her. It was obvious that she wouldn't hear it.
        <p></p>Mahiru's cheeks were tinged with red as she squirmed and shifted, looking at the floor.
        <p></p>Amane groaned. He wasn't sure what to do, either. Anything had to be better than
        <p></p>doing nothing while the frustration and humiliation kept bubbling up inside him.
        <p></p>"…Uh, I'm gonna go wash the dishes."
        <p></p>"O-okay."
        <p></p>At the moment, a tactical retreat seemed like the best play. Avoid and escape. Staying
        <p></p>here to watch Mahiru tremble in shame was bad for his heart.
        <p></p>As he took two deep breaths and then stood up from the table and gathered the dishes
        <p></p>and carried them to the sink, Mahiru sank into the living room sofa and buried her face
        <p></p>in a cushion. She was acting as if she was the one in anguish over getting unexpected
        <p></p>compliments.
        <p></p>"If you're that embarrassed," Amane grumbled to himself, "maybe you shouldn't have
        <p></p>said anything." But he felt as if a slight weight had been lifted off his chest by Mahiru's
        <p></p>words. The whole thing had been heart-wrenching, for sure, but also a bit of a relief.
        <p></p>Even though it was winter, Amane decided to wash the dishes with cold water. He
        <p></p>hoped the icy shock would help clear his mind.
        <p></p>"Hey, hey, Amane? Can I borrow the angel?"
        <p></p>The phone call from Chitose came in the evening, three days after the new semester
        <p></p>had started.
        <p></p>Normally, they would talk through a messaging app, but for some unknown reason,
        <p></p>she actually called him. And she was asking about Mahiru. Amane was really confused.
        <p></p>Chitose asked to borrow Mahiru, but Mahiru's not mine to lend out, so if Chitose wants
        <p></p>some of her time, she had better ask her herself.
        <p></p>"Don't ask me. Ask her."
        <p></p>"Is she there with you?"
        <p></p>"…She is, but—"
        <p></p>"All right, ask her if she wants to hang out together tomorrow after school."
        <p></p>"Ask her yourself!"
        <p></p>He briefly wondered if she didn't have Mahiru's contact information, but then he
        <p></p>remembered at Christmastime when Chitose had been so busy messing with Mahiru
        <p></p>that she had completely forgotten to exchange numbers with the girl.
        <p></p>So she must have decided that the best way to get to Mahiru was through Amane, who
        <p></p>definitely had Mahiru's contact information and could often be found right beside her,
        <p></p>too. He could understand the thought process, but he wanted to tell her that he wasn't
        <p></p>a carrier pigeon, delivering messages back and forth like it was his job.
        <p></p>For the time being, he decided that she had better talk to Mahiru directly, so he handed
        <p></p>the phone over to Mahiru, who was sitting next to him looking confused, and told her,
        <p></p>"Chitose wants to talk to you."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked perplexed but dutifully took the smartphone and held it up to her ear
        <p></p>as Amane leaned back in his seat.
        <p></p>"Mahiru here… Huh, tomorrow? S-sure, I don't have any particular plans, but…"
        <p></p>Amane smiled mischievously as he watched Mahiru's troubled expression.
        <p></p>I bet Chitose's putting the pressure on her by talking a mile a minute like always.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't look upset or anything. She just seemed earnestly surprised by the
        <p></p>sudden proposal and unsure how to handle it.
        <p></p>She was shooting glances over at Amane, so he told her, "I'll leave it up to your
        <p></p>judgment. She wants to hang out with you, not me."
        <p></p>Even Mahiru hung out with friends sometimes, but she preferred to come home after
        <p></p>a few hours and spend her time in the kitchen.
        <p></p>Amane thought that she could do with an excuse to go relax a bit, though he wasn't
        <p></p>entirely sure that hanging out with Chitose really lent itself to relaxation.
        <p></p>"S-sure… Um, in that case, I think I'll accept your invitation, but…"
        <p></p>Perhaps Amane's assurance had been the deciding factor. When she told Chitose as
        <p></p>much, the happy "Yay!!" from the other end of the phone line was clearly audible, and
        <p></p>Mahiru reflexively pulled the phone away from her ear.
        <p></p>Amane caught Mahiru's eye and gave her a knowing smile. Chitose could be… a lot to
        <p></p>handle. Mahiru also smiled, looking a bit nervous but also relieved and even happy.
        <p></p>When Chitose finally settled down, Mahiru returned the phone to her ear. Amane
        <p></p>watched them chat for another moment or two before Mahiru eventually hung up.
        <p></p>"Thank you very much," she said politely. "Here's your phone back."
        <p></p>Their conversation had apparently reached a resolution, and tomorrow she would be
        <p></p>joining Chitose on some excursion.
        <p></p>"Well, that was sudden. Then again, that's how Chitose always operates."
        <p></p>"W-well, I certainly was surprised."
        <p></p>"She's not a bad person. She can just be a little forceful."
        <p></p>Amane knew that was quite the understatement. Chitose usually meant well, but she
        <p></p>could definitely be pushy.
        <p></p>Mahiru wore a troubled smile, as if she already knew that, but she didn't seem upset,
        <p></p>so that was good, Amane thought. He'd always found it a little sad how few people got
        <p></p>along with their buddies' girlfriends.
        <p></p>"Go have fun tomorrow; don't worry about me."
        <p></p>"All right."
        <p></p>"…Oh, that's right—"
        <p></p>"What?"
        <p></p>There was one thing that Amane had to warn her about.
        <p></p>"If she starts harassing you or makes you uncomfortable, feel free to give her a smack.
        <p></p>You don't have to hold back. That girl is exactly like my mom—she loves cute things,
        <p></p>so she's almost certainly going to get handsy with a beauty like you."
        <p></p>Amane had managed to keep Chitose in check before, but now he was a little worried
        <p></p>to be sending Mahiru off alone with her. Mahiru was undeniably beautiful—she turned
        <p></p>heads wherever she went. He knew she had to be careful about getting hit on by
        <p></p>strangers, but Chitose was another matter. Yes, he had relied on Chitose's keen insight
        <p></p>on the occasion of Mahiru's birthday, but he also knew that when it came to cute
        <p></p>things, the girl just couldn't help herself. Amane felt it was necessary to at least warn
        <p></p>Mahiru about Chitose's wandering hands.
        <p></p>"Now, I don't think she's going to bother you too much, but if you only give her a
        <p></p>halfhearted rejection, she's bound to get excited and pounce you, so be careful." Amane
        <p></p>noticed that Mahiru's lips were pressed tightly together so he cocked his head
        <p></p>quizzically and asked, "Hey, what's up?"
        <p></p>"…Nothing at all."
        <p></p>Mahiru quietly averted her eyes.
        <p></p>On the day that Mahiru was supposed to hang out with Chitose, Amane hurried home
        <p></p>and spent some quiet time alone for the first time in a while.
        <p></p>Recently, he and Mahiru had been spending pretty much every day together, especially
        <p></p>with her making his lunch sometimes, so this was almost like a holiday for Amane.
        <p></p>Of course, he was happy that they were together so often… but sometimes it was nice
        <p></p>to have space to himself like this, too.
        <p></p>The seat beside him felt a little cold, though.
        <p></p>Man, I really got used to having Mahiru around, huh?
        <p></p>Only a few months had passed since they'd first met, and he was already taking her
        <p></p>presence for granted. Amane felt like they'd gotten very close, more like two people
        <p></p>who'd known each other for years, rather than months. He figured that they must be
        <p></p>quite compatible.
        <p></p>Personally, Amane really liked where they were in their relationship—they were close
        <p></p>enough to enjoy the time they spent together without stepping on each other's toes.
        <p></p>The only problem was, he liked it so much that he didn't want to let go.
        <p></p>Man, I'm simpleminded.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't the kind of guy to come out and passionately declare his love, but he
        <p></p>couldn't deny that his feelings for Mahiru went far beyond those of a neighbor and a
        <p></p>friend. At the same time, he refused to allow himself to develop any serious romantic
        <p></p>interest in her. If he let the scales tip any further, he didn't think he would be able to
        <p></p>see Mahiru as a friend anymore. Amane was aware of the tension in his heart, and it
        <p></p>made him deeply uneasy.
        <p></p>That's why he took his romantic feelings and stuffed them deep down in his gut where
        <p></p>nobody would see them.
        <p></p>Mahiru would only be troubled by his affection, he knew. She cared about him in her
        <p></p>own way, but it was obvious that she was not in love with him or anything like that.
        <p></p>There was no way that she would ever fall for a loser like him.
        <p></p>Sure, she sometimes said nice things about him, but that didn't mean she thought
        <p></p>about him that way, and if he tried to complicate their relationship by taking it in a
        <p></p>direction that she didn't like, it would only make things awkward.
        <p></p>Amane turned to look out the window, hoping to get away from the squirming
        <p></p>uneasiness in his chest.
        <p></p>It was winter, so the days ended early, and a curtain of utter darkness had fallen over
        <p></p>the sky. It was just past six o'clock, but it already seemed late at night.
        <p></p>Mahiru was with Chitose, so she wasn't going to be out too late, but even so, he felt a
        <p></p>little anxious at the idea of two good-looking high school girls walking around alone
        <p></p>in this darkness.
        <p></p>When will you two be done?
        <p></p>When he sent this message to Chitose, who always kept her smartphone close, he got
        <p></p>a reply right away.
        <p></p>We're saying good-bye soon.
        <p></p>Feeling relieved that Chitose wasn't going to keep them out all night, Amane sent
        <p></p>another message asking when they expected to get to the station. Then he stood up
        <p></p>from the sofa and headed for the bathroom.
        <p></p>I think I have a little hair wax left over from the other day.
        <p></p>He wasn't all that interested in styling his hair, but if he was planning to go meet
        <p></p>Mahiru in public, it was the least he could do.
        <p></p>If he was being honest, getting dressed up was a huge pain, but Amane's parents had
        <p></p>taught him how to make himself presentable. Surely he could reproduce the hairstyle
        <p></p>from memory.
        <p></p>When he looked in the mirror, Amane saw his usual gloomy self staring back at him.
        <p></p>He popped open the hair wax, confident that he could transform the uncouth,
        <p></p>unfashionable youth standing before him.
        <p></p>It was the middle of winter, and on top of that, the sun had set, so the temperature had
        <p></p>dipped quite low.
        <p></p>After considering both warmth and fashion, Amane decided on a light-gray sweater
        <p></p>and navy blue peacoat, paired with fleece-lined black skinny jeans, but even so, he was
        <p></p>undeniably cold. He could only imagine how cold Mahiru must have felt in only her
        <p></p>school uniform and jacket.
        <p></p>Even though Mahiru wore thick tights during the winter, her uniform's skirt, its length
        <p></p>determined by school regulations, still looked downright freezing to him. He wanted
        <p></p>to tell her it'd be better to wear sweatpants underneath it.
        <p></p>Some of the girls he walked past were wearing even shorter skirts. Amane was keenly
        <p></p>aware of the tremendous lengths some people would go to in pursuit of fashion.
        <p></p>As these thoughts bounced around in his mind, he nestled the lower half of his face in
        <p></p>the scarf he had received from Mahiru and hurried to the nearest station.
        <p></p>Apparently, the girls had taken the train to a big shopping complex. The station was
        <p></p>within walking distance of Amane's apartment, and according to Chitose, the train
        <p></p>should be arriving any moment, so he had probably shown up at just the right time.
        <p></p>As Amane walked, his freshly styled hair was blown about a bit by the wind, but not
        <p></p>badly enough to mess it up.
        <p></p>If it had gotten too ruffled, of course he would have had to stop to fix it, however
        <p></p>reluctant he might be. Amane was quickly gaining a newfound respect for anyone who
        <p></p>strove to be fashionable every day.
        <p></p>He was walking silently, lost in his own thoughts, when the station came into view.
        <p></p>Considering the direction of the apartment complex, Mahiru should come out of this exit,
        <p></p>so if I wait nearby, I'm sure I'll see her.
        <p></p>He leaned against the wall near the exit and waited, checking the time. Before long, a
        <p></p>girl with familiar blond hair came out of the gates.
        <p></p>"Mahiru!" he called out to her.
        <p></p>Recognizing his voice, Mahiru turned to look—and the moment she laid eyes on
        <p></p>Amane, she practically froze.
        <p></p>"Ah… what? Wh-why?"
        <p></p>She was obviously surprised by his appearance. Chitose must have told her that he
        <p></p>was coming to meet her, but she clearly hadn't expected him to show up looking like
        <p></p>he had during their New Year's shrine visit.
        <p></p>But Amane hadn't even entertained the idea of coming out with his usual sloppy
        <p></p>appearance and normal hairdo. He would be in trouble if someone identified him as
        <p></p>the mystery man, so if he was going to accompany Mahiru in public, he needed to dress
        <p></p>up a bit. He had to disguise himself, of course, but he also felt like he should look
        <p></p>decent if he was going to be seen with her in public.
        <p></p>"What, did you think I couldn't dress myself? I can't exactly come meet you at the
        <p></p>station in my normal clothes, now can I?"
        <p></p>"…I suppose not, but—"
        <p></p>"Does it look bad? I checked myself in the mirror, but maybe it's weird…"
        <p></p>He had chosen an ordinary, safe outfit and tried to style his hair like it had been on the
        <p></p>day of the shrine visit, so Amane had hoped that he didn't look too strange. But now
        <p></p>he realized that it probably looked all wrong to anybody with real taste.
        <p></p>He could feel people's gazes flicker over him from time to time, so there was a good
        <p></p>chance that he did look weird after all. It was a bit of a shock to realize that he looked
        <p></p>unfashionable despite trying his best.
        <p></p>But Mahiru shook her head, appearing flustered. "It looks good," she reassured him,
        <p></p>and Amane felt himself breathe a sigh of relief.
        <p></p>"I'm glad you think so. Look, it's already dark, right? It would be dangerous to walk
        <p></p>home alone."
        <p></p>"…I kn-know that, but—"
        <p></p>"I guess you probably didn't want me to come meet you after all. Well, if you don't want
        <p></p>to walk together, I can walk a little ways ahead, and you can just follow me, I guess…"
        <p></p>"I—I never said that. I, umm… really do appreciate it."
        <p></p>"Of course."
        <p></p>Amane was happy to hear that she didn't object to him being there. He pulled a hand
        <p></p>out of his pocket and offered it to her. Timidly, she pressed her palm into his. Maybe it
        <p></p>was because of the cold weather, but her hand felt much chillier than he expected.
        <p></p>"So cold. What happened to your gloves?"
        <p></p>"I washed them, so they're still drying. And anyway, where are yours?"
        <p></p>"I just stuck my hands in my pockets."
        <p></p>He couldn't scold her too much, since he'd also forgotten to wear gloves, a lesson he
        <p></p>should have learned as a child.
        <p></p>Amane didn't say anything further and simply kept her dainty hand nestled in his
        <p></p>palm. It felt incredibly delicate compared to his.
        <p></p>"…So warm…," Mahiru mumbled quietly, and her eyes twinkled happily as she smiled.
        <p></p>Amane felt his heart wrench when he saw her innocent expression, but he refused to
        <p></p>let it show and kept his attention solely focused on her small hand in his as he casually
        <p></p>slipped Mahiru's schoolbag, as well as several shopping bags she'd acquired on her
        <p></p>outing, over his shoulder.
        <p></p>Mahiru glanced up at him but didn't say anything.
        <p></p>"What is it?" he asked.
        <p></p>Abruptly, Mahiru turned away. Her ears and cheeks were slightly red, probably from
        <p></p>the cold, he thought.
        <p></p>"Come on, let's go home. Do you want to stop at the convenience store on the way? The
        <p></p>pork buns are good this time of year."
        <p></p>"…I'm happy with a sweet bean bun."
        <p></p>"You sure do like sweets… What are we doing about dinner?"
        <p></p>"I've marinated some eggs and prepared some char siu pork and bamboo shoots, so
        <p></p>we're having ramen."
        <p></p>"Ramen is perfect on a cold day, huh?"
        <p></p>"Yes, it is."
        <p></p>Amane hadn't looked in the refrigerator, so he was pleasantly surprised to hear the
        <p></p>evening's menu. Sure, the soup and noodles would be prepackaged, but Mahiru had
        <p></p>made the toppings by hand. Amane's mouth started to water as he imagined the thick
        <p></p>slices of pork and perfectly seasoned soft-boiled eggs.
        <p></p>They were sure to hit the spot on a chilly winter evening.
        <p></p>"…I wonder if I'll be able to eat a whole bowl of ramen after a bean bun?"
        <p></p>"Well then, how about you give me half? That way, you can probably finish both."
        <p></p>"…Okay."
        <p></p>For some reason, Mahiru looked a little embarrassed, so Amane smiled slightly and
        <p></p>squeezed her hand just a little.
        <p></p>"Shiina was spotted with another mystery man!"
        <p></p>The following day, Itsuki shot him a hard look. "Not only are the rumors still spreading,
        <p></p>somebody added fuel to the fire. What're ya gonna do, Amane?"
        <p></p>Amane turned away sharply. "Hell if I know…"
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 20: The Angel in Poor Health 
        <p></p>It happened on a Friday, on one of the last days of January.
        <p></p>"…Hmm?"
        <p></p>Amane returned to the living room after cleaning up dinner, but when he looked at
        <p></p>Mahiru, he noticed that her cheeks were unusually red.
        <p></p>At first, he thought that maybe the thermostat was set too high, but it was on the same
        <p></p>temperature as always, and Mahiru wasn't wearing particularly warm clothing, either.
        <p></p>When he looked closely, he saw that her expression seemed distant and kind of
        <p></p>unfocused. Her breathing was also shallower than usual. All signs pointed to her being
        <p></p>sick.
        <p></p>When he took a moment to think about it, the weather had gotten much colder lately,
        <p></p>and Mahiru, as an honors student, had been busy helping her teacher with some big
        <p></p>project. On top of that, she was doing her usual housework and making dinner for the
        <p></p>two of them. It wasn't strange at all for her to fall ill with such a workload.
        <p></p>Amane admonished himself for not noticing her condition earlier. He regretted not
        <p></p>paying more attention to her.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, your face is red. Do you think you have a fever?"
        <p></p>"Of course not."
        <p></p>Mahiru decisively dismissed Amane's concerns. Her expression was stiff, and she
        <p></p>shook her head, but she couldn't hide the redness in her cheeks.
        <p></p>Obviously, he couldn't just take her word for it, so even though he knew that it was
        <p></p>rude to touch her without her permission, Amane gently placed the palm of his hand
        <p></p>on Mahiru's forehead, which was usually hidden by her bangs.
        <p></p>As he had expected, her head was much hotter than his palm. Mahiru's typical body
        <p></p>temperature wasn't that high compared to Amane's, so it was pretty clear she had a
        <p></p>fever.
        <p></p>"You're hot as the sun."
        <p></p>"…No, I'm not."
        <p></p>"All right, how about we take your temperature and confirm it?"
        <p></p>"There's no need. You're worrying over nothing."
        <p></p>Her voice was thin and lacked her usual energy.
        <p></p>"Oh, come on. I can tell by looking at you that you're running a fever."
        <p></p>"I'm just a bit flushed."
        <p></p>"If that's the case, then you'll need to take your temperature and prove it."
        <p></p>Amane stood up and retrieved a thermometer from the first aid box on the shelf in the
        <p></p>living room. He brought it back to Mahiru, but she turned her face away.
        <p></p>She either didn't want to acknowledge her fever, or she insisted on bluffing.
        <p></p>It was probably one or the other, but Amane couldn't really proceed until she agreed
        <p></p>to have her temperature taken. He stood right in front of the uncooperative Mahiru
        <p></p>and placed the thermometer firmly in her hand.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, either I can loosen your clothes and stick the thermometer in your armpit,
        <p></p>or you can take your own temperature… Which do you prefer?"
        <p></p>Amane put on a very serious face when he made this threat.
        <p></p>Mahiru let out a startled groan and turned her body toward the back of the sofa. She
        <p></p>seemed like she had resigned herself to it, and he heard the sound of the thermometer
        <p></p>turning on, so just to be safe, Amane also turned his back to Mahiru and waited for her
        <p></p>to finish.
        <p></p>Before long, he heard another electronic beep. Amane waited for Mahiru to put her
        <p></p>clothes back in order. When he turned around, she was looking at him, expressionless,
        <p></p>holding the thermometer in its case.
        <p></p>"…Thirty-seven point two degrees Celsius. A slight fever, all right?"
        <p></p>"Hmm…"
        <p></p>"It's only a little higher than usual, and I still feel totally fine, so…"
        <p></p>Amane took the thermometer from Mahiru's hand and removed it from the case again.
        <p></p>The thermometer Amane had used was the type that recorded the previously measured
        <p></p>temperature, and when he turned it on again—sure enough, it displayed a temperature
        <p></p>more than one whole degree higher than Mahiru had reported.
        <p></p>"Oh yeah? I see thirty-eight point four here."
        <p></p>She averted her eyes.
        <p></p>"Seriously, have you been running yourself ragged and letting me sit on my butt the
        <p></p>whole time? You're taking all day tomorrow and tomorrow night off. No buts."
        <p></p>When Amane caught a cold, Mahiru had put him to bed and had him change into
        <p></p>pajamas and brought him rice porridge, but he wondered how she would fare doing
        <p></p>nothing when it was her turn.
        <p></p>Amane had a relatively sturdy constitution, so he'd simply gone to sleep and woken
        <p></p>up feeling better, but if Mahiru didn't rest and kept running around, she would never
        <p></p>recover, even from something relatively minor. Mahiru was sick, and that meant no
        <p></p>straining herself.
        <p></p>However, Mahiru was still avoiding his gaze. She didn't seem likely to agree to a strict
        <p></p>regimen of bed rest.
        <p></p>…So stubborn… Well, I guess there's no other way, then.
        <p></p>Amane extended a hand to Mahiru.
        <p></p>The fever was slowing her down, and it took her a moment to turn to him. Thinking
        <p></p>that it would be just perfect if she didn't resist, Amane put his arms around Mahiru's
        <p></p>back and under her knees and lifted her off the sofa.
        <p></p>Carrying her like a child, so that she had to cling tightly to him, Amane checked that
        <p></p>he could hear the sound of jangling keys from Mahiru's pocket and headed for the
        <p></p>door.
        <p></p>"Uh, A-Amane…?"
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to finally realize that she was being carried, and he heard her flustered
        <p></p>voice coming from between his arms.
        <p></p>When Amane stopped for a moment and looked down at her, Mahiru's cheeks were
        <p></p>still red with fever, and she was peering up at him with confusion in her eyes.
        <p></p>"You're definitely going to push yourself too hard, so I'm going to keep watch until you
        <p></p>fall asleep."
        <p></p>"Y-you're going to barge into a girl's bedroom?"
        <p></p>"If you don't like that idea, you can sleep in my room."
        <p></p>"…And the option for you to leave me alone…?"
        <p></p>"That ship sailed when you refused to rest."
        <p></p>Even Amane knew that no matter how close of a friend he was, going into a girl's
        <p></p>apartment, and what's more, into her bedroom, and standing guard until she fell
        <p></p>asleep, would be a serious invasion of her privacy. It was definitely not something he
        <p></p>would ever even consider under normal circumstances. But after seeing the way she
        <p></p>was acting, he was seriously worried for her health. He just knew that Mahiru would
        <p></p>run herself into the ground if he didn't do something. As far as he was concerned, there
        <p></p>wasn't any other option.
        <p></p>Long ago, Mahiru had forced her way into his apartment, so he figured that just this
        <p></p>once, he would employ the same forceful measures for her sake.
        <p></p>"Okay, which do you prefer? My house or yours?"
        <p></p>"…And if I say I don't like either?"
        <p></p>"If you say that, then we default to barging into your apartment so I can toss you into
        <p></p>bed."
        <p></p>"…Your room is fine…"
        <p></p>Apparently, Mahiru didn't want Amane bursting into her bedroom, so she finally
        <p></p>relented and agreed to rest in Amane's room instead.
        <p></p>Amane exhaled hard—neither a sigh nor a breath of relief. I understand why she
        <p></p>wouldn't want to let a boy into her room, he thought as he carried her to his bed. And I
        <p></p>know she didn't make a huge fuss, either. But if she was going to be so stubborn about it,
        <p></p>I wish she would have just stayed home and rested up in the first place.
        <p></p>Mahiru hadn't been in Amane's bedroom since New Year's.
        <p></p>For the moment, he lowered Mahiru onto the bed, then started fishing through his
        <p></p>dresser drawers. He figured it would be best if she changed into something she
        <p></p>wouldn't have to worry about getting sweat on before going to sleep. He chose the
        <p></p>smallest shirt and sweatpants he had, then set them down by Mahiru's side.
        <p></p>"Here. Change into these."
        <p></p>"…But—"
        <p></p>"Or I can strip you."
        <p></p>"I'll get changed…"
        <p></p>Mahiru reluctantly picked up the change of clothes.
        <p></p>Amane was not at all prepared to carry out his threat, and he didn't think Mahiru
        <p></p>would have let him anyway. Just thinking about it made him want to die of shame. He
        <p></p>was thoroughly relieved to hear that she would play along.
        <p></p>Since he wasn't about to stay and watch her change, Amane quickly left the room and
        <p></p>retrieved some sports drinks from his pantry shelf.
        <p></p>After Amane had recovered from his cold the previous year, he had stocked up on
        <p></p>prepackaged rice porridge, extra sports drinks, and cooling sheets. His preparations
        <p></p>were finally paying off.
        <p></p>Carrying the supplies, along with a towel and some medicine, Amane knocked on the
        <p></p>door of his own bedroom and heard a small voice reply, "I've finished changing."
        <p></p>He entered and saw Mahiru looking at him, propped up on his bed, wearing his
        <p></p>clothes. As expected, even the smallest clothes he had were too large on Mahiru—
        <p></p>baggy was probably the most accurate word.
        <p></p>She looked adorable, dressed in clothes that were the wrong size, but Amane drove
        <p></p>that thought from his mind and set down the sports drinks and towel on the table
        <p></p>beside the bed.
        <p></p>"Will you take some medicine? It's over-the-counter stuff."
        <p></p>"…Sure. I have the same type at home, so I think it's all right."
        <p></p>"Okay."
        <p></p>He went back to the kitchen for a moment and filled a cup with water. While he was
        <p></p>there, he fished an ice pack out of the freezer. He recalled the saying "Preparation is
        <p></p>the key to success" and smiled to himself about how true that was turning out to be.
        <p></p>Amane hurried back to the bedroom and handed the water to Mahiru, then took some
        <p></p>pills out of the packaging and put them in her open palm.
        <p></p>"Take those and drink plenty of water. Then get to sleep."
        <p></p>While Mahiru was swallowing the medicine, he wrapped the ice pack in the towel and
        <p></p>set it beside her pillow. As he did, he heard Mahiru mumble "…You're pretty well
        <p></p>prepared."
        <p></p>"I'm just doing everything you did for me, you know."
        <p></p>Basically, he was just repeating exactly what Mahiru had done when she nursed him
        <p></p>back to health. He was healthy now, so it was only natural that he should return the
        <p></p>favor.
        <p></p>"By the way, why were you trying to push yourself so hard?"
        <p></p>"…Because I'm incapable of effective self-management."
        <p></p>"Look, you have to draw the line somewhere. You're always running around, working
        <p></p>hard, and your body is probably all worn out. Come to think of it, I guess I owe you an
        <p></p>apology for my part in keeping you so busy."
        <p></p>Making his dinner every night had undoubtedly placed an extra burden on Mahiru that
        <p></p>she clearly didn't need. She had her own life to deal with, and here she was taking care
        <p></p>of him. It was inexcusable, really.
        <p></p>Mahiru's fever seemed to be connected to her fatigue, so Amane wanted to care of her
        <p></p>the best he could and let her rest.
        <p></p>"…I've never thought of you as a burden, Amane."
        <p></p>"Really…? Well, even if that's true, think of this as a good opportunity for you to take it
        <p></p>easy."
        <p></p>He was happy to hear her say that she didn't find the time they spent together to be
        <p></p>taxing, but he still felt guilty about how much attention she had paid to his needs. This
        <p></p>was his chance to tend to Mahiru while she got some rest. It would probably actually
        <p></p>be better to send her home, but Amane wanted to stay by her side. He knew he would
        <p></p>never forgive himself if anything happened to her.
        <p></p>Mahiru hesitated but eventually agreed to lie down.
        <p></p>She buried everything up to her neck under the comforter, then glanced at Amane. She
        <p></p>looked slightly embarrassed, probably because she didn't like having someone standing
        <p></p>over her while she slept. Amane was about to leave her alone, thinking that he
        <p></p>shouldn't stare at girls in their sleep, when he felt something tug at his sleeve. When
        <p></p>he looked down, he found Mahiru's small hand grasping at his shirt.
        <p></p>Mahiru was also staring at her hand, caramel-colored eyes wide with shock. She looked
        <p></p>just as surprised as he did. A moment passed, and then she quickly released him and
        <p></p>buried herself completely under the comforter, pulling it all the way up over her face
        <p></p>to hide.
        <p></p>"…Good night," came a feeble mumble from Mahiru, cocooned in the blanket.
        <p></p>Amane scratched his cheek, unsure what to do.
        <p></p>…She gets really anxious when she's not feeling well, huh?
        <p></p>Figuring she would probably forgive him, he turned back the comforter a little bit,
        <p></p>until he found Mahiru's hand and grabbed hold of it.
        <p></p>He squeezed it gently, and Mahiru stuck her face out from under the comforter, wearing
        <p></p>a troubled expression. But Amane had a feeling that was more from embarrassment
        <p></p>than anger.
        <p></p>"…I'm not a child, you know."
        <p></p>"I know. I'll just be here keeping watch so that you won't run away, so don't mind me."
        <p></p>"…I'm not running away this late in the game."
        <p></p>"I wonder. Well, I'll get out of here once you're asleep, so you can relax. Come on, if you
        <p></p>want me to leave, hurry up and fall asleep."
        <p></p>Amane was being very direct. But it worked. Mahiru meekly snuggled back down
        <p></p>under the comforter, and he felt her squeeze his hand back.
        <p></p>He felt sort of happy, and embarrassed, and for some reason, agitated. It was like
        <p></p>someone was tickling the inside of his chest.
        <p></p>Amane kept hold of her slender fingers until he heard her peaceful sleeping breaths.
        <p></p>The following morning, Amane woke up on the sofa and checked the clock as he
        <p></p>stretched his stiff body.
        <p></p>It was just past eight in the morning. It wasn't a school day, and he almost never got
        <p></p>up this early on the weekends, but Amane wanted to see how Mahiru was doing, so he
        <p></p>decided he'd better get a move on. He had peeked in on her just in case during the
        <p></p>night and confirmed that she looked like she was sleeping peacefully, but he couldn't
        <p></p>tell what her true condition was.
        <p></p>He stood up and stretched, then quietly headed toward his own bedroom and opened
        <p></p>the door without making a sound.
        <p></p>He hadn't knocked in case Mahiru was still sleeping, but when he opened the door, she
        <p></p>sat up.
        <p></p>Her cheeks were still slightly red, but not as red as the night before, and although her
        <p></p>expression was slack and somewhat bleary, her eyes focused when she spotted
        <p></p>Amane.
        <p></p>"Morning. How are you feeling? The truth, please."
        <p></p>"…I'm still sluggish."
        <p></p>"Gotcha. I'm going to the convenience store to buy breakfast and something that you
        <p></p>might be able to eat."
        <p></p>He did have that rice porridge, but he had the image that sick people ate meal
        <p></p>supplement jelly and canned peaches and thought those might be easier to eat, so
        <p></p>that's what he was planning to get.
        <p></p>He was relieved to find that she seemed to be doing better than expected, and he
        <p></p>pulled another change of clothes out of the dresser and set them on the bed.
        <p></p>"I'm leaving you a change of clothes here. Make sure you take your temperature, too.
        <p></p>If you want to wipe off the sweat, go ahead and use the water in that wash basin and
        <p></p>this towel."
        <p></p>Before leaving the room, Amane pointed to the basin he had used to wipe the sweat
        <p></p>from her face during the night.
        <p></p>Then he retrieved his wallet and left the apartment.
        <p></p>Walking at a leisurely pace, Amane made sure that Mahiru would have plenty of time
        <p></p>to wipe herself off and change her clothes, even if her fever slowed her down. The
        <p></p>convenience store was located quite close to their apartment building, so he could
        <p></p>have made the trip in just a few minutes, but he was careful and took his time shopping.
        <p></p>Amane returned home after spending a solid twenty minutes out of the house and put
        <p></p>away the cold items in the refrigerator. When he finally went in to see Mahiru, she had
        <p></p>finished changing and was waiting for him.
        <p></p>She also seemed more alert and already looked healthier than the day before. She was
        <p></p>smiling faintly.
        <p></p>"Any fever?"
        <p></p>"Thirty-seven point five degrees."
        <p></p>"Hmm, still slightly high… Don't move around too much."
        <p></p>"I kn-know that."
        <p></p>"Do you have an appetite? I've got some rice porridge here, and I also bought pudding
        <p></p>and jelly."
        <p></p>He knew he shouldn't let her eat anything too heavy, so he had brought back things
        <p></p>that were easy to eat and soft, but what she ate would depend on Mahiru's appetite.
        <p></p>"Oh, sorry you went to the—"
        <p></p>"Don't apologize. You did the same thing for me. So pudding or jelly, which do you
        <p></p>want?"
        <p></p>"…Jelly."
        <p></p>"Here ya go. Do you think you can eat some rice porridge as well?"
        <p></p>"…Yes."
        <p></p>"All right, I'll heat it up; so you sit tight."
        <p></p>Amane shuffled out of the room. He was concerned about Mahiru. She seemed anxious.
        <p></p>Amane placed a pouch of rice porridge in some hot water to warm it up, then poured
        <p></p>it into a bowl.
        <p></p>If he was really going to repay Mahiru for what she did last time, he probably should
        <p></p>have made the porridge by hand, but he honestly wasn't sure he would have been able
        <p></p>to pull it off without messing up something, so he'd decided to fall back on the reliable
        <p></p>instant pouches.
        <p></p>He was sure it would be nothing next to Mahiru's homemade porridge, but Amane
        <p></p>figured the most important thing was that she had something, anything, to eat.
        <p></p>"Here. Think you can manage to eat on your own?" Amane asked her jokingly as he
        <p></p>held out a spoon and waited for her to take the bowl of porridge.
        <p></p>Mahiru scowled at him sullenly. "Are you making fun of me? And what if I said I can't
        <p></p>eat on my own—I suppose you'd offer to feed me?"
        <p></p>"Ah, I mean… I'll feed you if you want, but…"
        <p></p>Mahiru's face went red, as if her fever had made a sudden comeback.
        <p></p>"…I-I'll eat by myself."
        <p></p>"Y-yeah."
        <p></p>She accepted the bowl from Amane and started taking small bites, but the redness did
        <p></p>not disappear by the time she was done eating.
        <p></p>She seemed to still have some appetite after finishing the porridge, so she opened the
        <p></p>jelly next. Once she put that away as well, she sighed. She looked much better now, so
        <p></p>all that was left was to get some rest so she could regain her strength. Amane was
        <p></p>rather relieved.
        <p></p>"Is there anything else you want me to do?"
        <p></p>"…Nothing for now."
        <p></p>"All right."
        <p></p>When Amane stood up to leave, thinking that he should probably just let her rest more,
        <p></p>Mahiru slowly looked up at him, as if making some sort of request. Her gaze was steady
        <p></p>and direct.
        <p></p>Sensing the fear and anxiety lurking behind her caramel-colored eyes, Amane sat
        <p></p>down right next to Mahiru.
        <p></p>"…Amane?"
        <p></p>"It's nothing."
        <p></p>If he told her up front that she seemed lonely, Mahiru would probably deny it outright
        <p></p>and chase him away.
        <p></p>So Amane sat quietly by the bedside and simply looked over at Mahiru, who was sitting
        <p></p>up in bed. "I'm not busy right now anyway. How about we just chat until you get a little
        <p></p>sleepy?"
        <p></p>"…Okay." She nodded.
        <p></p>He smiled at her as he leaned against the bed, and Mahiru also smiled faintly as if
        <p></p>reassured.
        <p></p>"…This is the first time someone's ever really taken care of me when I'm sick… Even
        <p></p>Miss Koyuki went home when her shift was over."
        <p></p>"Miss Koyuki?"
        <p></p>"The maid who worked for us when I was at home."
        <p></p>"Ah, the person who taught you how to cook?"
        <p></p>"…I was always alone in the mornings and evenings, so…"
        <p></p>"Well, I'm here now. Besides, I'll be in a serious pinch if you don't hurry up and get
        <p></p>well."
        <p></p>"…I'm sorry for using your bed. And about dinner…"
        <p></p>"That's not what I meant. It's awful, you know? I just want to see my friend get better."
        <p></p>Even though they had only known each other a relatively short while, after all the time
        <p></p>they'd spent together, it was only natural for Amane to worry about her. Even if she
        <p></p>hadn't been running herself ragged taking care of him among other things, Amane still
        <p></p>would have worried about her. She was his friend, after all.
        <p></p>"And besides, I'm not the type of person who celebrates when someone else gets sick."
        <p></p>"…I know that already. You're a nice person, Amane."
        <p></p>"Yes, ma'am."
        <p></p>He was a little embarrassed and felt awkward being told directly to his face that he
        <p></p>was nice.
        <p></p>"Go ahead and get some rest… You'll feel better if you sleep as much as you need."
        <p></p>"…Okay."
        <p></p>"Shall I stand guard until you drift off again?"
        <p></p>Amane made a joke to hide his embarrassment, but Mahiru blinked in surprise.
        <p></p>"…Yes, please do."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"You suggested it."
        <p></p>"I did, but…"
        <p></p>He never imagined that she would accept. He had expected Mahiru to glow bright red
        <p></p>and immediately reject the idea. His eyes went wide in surprise, and now Mahiru was
        <p></p>the one wearing an impish smile.
        <p></p>"Or does a man go back on his word?"
        <p></p>"…Absolutely not. Time to lie down," Amane muttered quietly. Then he added "You win
        <p></p>this round" as he squeezed Mahiru's hand.
        <p></p>She slipped under the covers. Then she looked at her hand resting in Amane's, and her
        <p></p>expression softened.
        <p></p>"…It's so warm."
        <p></p>"Your fever must have gone down a lot, if you've cooled off… All right, get some sleep."
        <p></p>"Okay."
        <p></p>She squeezed his hand once in return. She looked like she was relieved that he was
        <p></p>there after all. Slowly, her eyes drifted closed, and before long, Amane could hear the
        <p></p>regular rhythm of her sleeping breath.
        <p></p>…You dummy, he groaned, covering his face with his other hand.
        <p></p>Whenever the two of them touched like this, Amane lost his cool. His heart was
        <p></p>pounding in his ears, and his face felt so hot that, for a moment, he wondered if
        <p></p>Mahiru's fever had jumped hosts. Amane was so flushed that he almost forgot which
        <p></p>of them was supposed to have the fever.
        <p></p>…This girl is really bad for my heart.
        <p></p>Amane glanced over at Mahiru and saw her sleeping peacefully, entirely relaxed and
        <p></p>blissfully ignorant of Amane's woes.
        <p></p>Amane swore under his breath and buried his face in the bedsheets.
        <p></p>It was his bed, but it had a sweet scent, a little different from his own.
        <p></p>When Amane came to, Mahiru's warmth had disappeared.
        <p></p>The hand he had been holding was gone, leaving Amane facedown in the bed, all alone.
        <p></p>He looked around the room in alarm, but Mahiru was obviously not in bed.
        <p></p>Amane looked at the clock on the side table, saw that it was two, and then realized
        <p></p>that he had crashed. He thought maybe it was because he had gotten up to check on
        <p></p>Mahiru during the night, but even so, Amane had never intended to sleep for so long.
        <p></p>Flustered, Amane stood up and headed for the living room.
        <p></p>He moved briskly, and it wasn't long before he saw Mahiru sitting with good posture on
        <p></p>the living room sofa. She wasn't dressed in his shirt and sweatpants anymore, but in
        <p></p>her own clothing, which likely meant that she'd gone home for a bit before returning.
        <p></p>"Amane, good morning."
        <p></p>"Morning. You weren't there when I woke up, so I panicked a little."
        <p></p>"Sorry. I took a quick shower and came back."
        <p></p>That must have been why she had changed clothes. Feeling relieved that she was well
        <p></p>enough to bathe, he pressed his palm against Mahiru's forehead just in case, but she
        <p></p>was already back to her usual temperature.
        <p></p>"Mm, seems like your fever broke. That's great."
        <p></p>"…I'm sorry for worrying you."
        <p></p>"You should be. Next time I'm going to do the same exact thing if you're not honest
        <p></p>with me."
        <p></p>He said this as he was taking a seat next to Mahiru, and she frowned uneasily.
        <p></p>"I'll be careful, but… Amane, won't you be angry if I cause you trouble again?"
        <p></p>"Trouble?"
        <p></p>"Because you had to nurse me and everything…"
        <p></p>"As if I'd ever consider any of that trouble, you dummy. Do I honestly seem that heartless
        <p></p>to you?"
        <p></p>"…Not at all. It's just… I was only wondering if it's all right to rely on you."
        <p></p>"You should rely on people for whatever you can. You're definitely the type who tries
        <p></p>to take everything upon yourself even when you don't need to."
        <p></p>They had only been together for a few months, but even so, Amane thought he
        <p></p>understood Mahiru's temperament pretty well.
        <p></p>She fundamentally didn't like to rely on other people, and she bottled up all her
        <p></p>feelings deep inside and tried to never let them show. She seemed like she shut herself
        <p></p>off from other people by building a wall that she didn't want anyone to slip behind.
        <p></p>"I mean, I know that I'm not very trustworthy, and you can't rely on me, but—"
        <p></p>"Th-that's not true! I trust you a lot, Amane."
        <p></p>"Good. Then don't force yourself and let me help you."
        <p></p>Without thinking, he reached out and ruffled Mahiru's hair, only after which he noticed
        <p></p>that Mahiru had gone completely still.
        <p></p>"Sorry. You hate that, don't you?"
        <p></p>"…Not exactly, no…"
        <p></p>Mahiru shook her head slowly, not to disentangle his hand from her hair, but to
        <p></p>disagree with his statement, then leaned her forehead against his upper arm.
        <p></p>His heart leaped in his chest when he felt the slight weight of her body pressing against
        <p></p>him, but without revealing it in the least, he patted her head once more. He heard a
        <p></p>truly quiet little whisper: "…Thank you so much."
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 21: Valentine’s Day 
        <p></p>By the beginning of February, rumors concerning Mahiru's "mystery man, possible
        <p></p>boyfriend" finally died down, despite the fact that Amane had carelessly added fuel to
        <p></p>the fire by picking her up from the station.
        <p></p>Even so, the idea of a boy who was not her boyfriend but was still very close to Mahiru
        <p></p>seemed to have taken root instead, and the new rumor was that Mahiru had feelings
        <p></p>for that boy… but Mahiru cheerfully denied it all in her friendly but ultimately
        <p></p>unyielding way, so eventually the stream of gossip dried up.
        <p></p>Amane had heard from Chitose, who had been observing the situation in the hallways,
        <p></p>that "her denial left no room for argument," so it seemed like Mahiru was pretty upset.
        <p></p>He wasn't surprised, but he was a little sad to hear how vehemently she was denying
        <p></p>it. Still, he knew there wasn't much to be done about it. The current situation was
        <p></p>probably driving Mahiru crazy, having to listen to all these wild rumors about a guy
        <p></p>she didn't even like that way.
        <p></p>Amane could do nothing but wear a wry smile.
        <p></p>"So speaking of February…," Chitose prodded.
        <p></p>"Oh yeah, final exams are coming up," Amane said.
        <p></p>"You know, for a teenage boy, you sure lack imagination."
        <p></p>Chitose didn't hide her disapproval at his reply.
        <p></p>She had paid him a visit at his apartment after school—or rather, she had barged in
        <p></p>without an invitation—on the pretense that she had something important to discuss,
        <p></p>though Amane was pretty sure she'd actually come to hang out with Mahiru.
        <p></p>Incidentally, Mahiru was in the kitchen putting on a pot of tea, so Amane and Chitose
        <p></p>were alone in the living room.
        <p></p>"I don't know about other high school guys and their imaginations, but I'd say that's a
        <p></p>reasonable train of thought for any student…"
        <p></p>"A high school guy in the prime of his life should be thinking about Valentine's Day,
        <p></p>don't you think?"
        <p></p>"I'm not in the prime of anything so no…"
        <p></p>"There you go again!"
        <p></p>Chitose was giving him a mischievous look even though she should know better than
        <p></p>most that there was no truth behind the rumors.
        <p></p>Amane glared at her, but her smile refused to crack. "So…," he said with a sigh, "what
        <p></p>did you want to talk about?"
        <p></p>Chitose had made a point to come to Amane's apartment alone. She obviously had
        <p></p>something she wanted to discuss with Amane and Mahiru, but not with her boyfriend,
        <p></p>Itsuki.
        <p></p>"Mm. I wanted to ask you what I should do about chocolates for Itsuki. When we were
        <p></p>in middle school, I made him chocolates out of a kit, the kind where you melt the
        <p></p>chocolate and pour it into a mold, but since we're high schoolers now, I'd like to make
        <p></p>something more sophisticated."
        <p></p>"In that case, Shiina's the one you oughtta ask."
        <p></p>After all, Amane knew nothing about cooking. At most, he might be able to offer some
        <p></p>insight into his best friend's tastes, but Chitose had actually been dating Itsuki for
        <p></p>longer than Amane had known him, so she probably knew what Itsuki liked better
        <p></p>than he did.
        <p></p>"I'm gonna ask her, too, but I thought since you're sorta a guy… you know? Maybe I
        <p></p>could get a male opinion."
        <p></p>"I'm not sorta anything. I'm all man."
        <p></p>"If you were a real man, you'd have made a move on a certain pretty girl by now,"
        <p></p>Chitose said slyly.
        <p></p>"Now, listen," Amane said with a grimace, "I've explained this before—we don't have
        <p></p>that sort of relationship. And besides, a real man is supposed to wait until he's in a
        <p></p>relationship to make a move."
        <p></p>"Oh, how wonderfully chivalrous of you," Chitose teased. "Your mama must have raised
        <p></p>you right."
        <p></p>Chitose might think he was uptight, but Amane didn't see anything wrong with
        <p></p>wanting to take it slow. Sure, plenty of guys could mess around with girls they didn't
        <p></p>even like, but could wasn't the same as should. More importantly, Amane couldn't see
        <p></p>himself doing that, especially if the other party just wasn't interested.
        <p></p>Now, it would have been a lie to say that he didn't have certain feelings for Mahiru.
        <p></p>Spending time with a girl so beautiful—inside and out—would stir up those sorts of
        <p></p>emotions in most any man.
        <p></p>But even then, the foolish idea to try something with had her never surfaced.
        <p></p>Whenever he thought about it, all kinds of other things got in the way—worrying
        <p></p>about hurting her feelings, worrying that she might come to hate him, worrying that
        <p></p>he did not appreciate her enough.
        <p></p>Also, Mahiru had made it quite clear that trying anything would result in serious social
        <p></p>repercussions, as well as grievous physical harm to a certain vital organ, and he did
        <p></p>not think that she was bluffing.
        <p></p>"Well, that's one of your good points, Amane, and I'm sure it's why Mahirun feels like
        <p></p>she can trust you."
        <p></p>Chitose had started referring to Mahiru by a nickname that had a cute ring to it.
        <p></p>Mahiru was listening in from the kitchen, but she didn't stop Chitose from calling her
        <p></p>that, so whether she was reluctant or comfortable with the name herself, she must
        <p></p>have known that she had a nickname now.
        <p></p>As far as Mahiru was concerned, it was better than being called an angel to her face.
        <p></p>"Though sometimes I wonder whether you're really a man at all…," Chitose continued.
        <p></p>"I can assure you, I am. I mean, have you ever seen a girl this flat?"
        <p></p>"Well, you're much too passive. A man is supposed to be a little ferocious sometimes."
        <p></p>"You think a guy like me could pull off ferocious?"
        <p></p>"You'd be fine if you dressed the part like those other times. Honestly, I'd like to see it
        <p></p>for myself."
        <p></p>Itsuki and Chitose had long since deduced that Amane was Mahiru's mystery man, and
        <p></p>he had finally acknowledged it just the other day, so there was no point in hiding it
        <p></p>now. But he wasn't about to get all dressed up just for their amusement.
        <p></p>"Give it up already."
        <p></p>"Come on; it's no big deeeal!"
        <p></p>"I can't spare the hair wax—or the patience, for that matter."
        <p></p>"Cheapskate!"
        <p></p>When Mahiru returned from the kitchen carrying a tray with three cups of milk tea,
        <p></p>Chitose had puffed out her cheeks and was pouting at him. Mahiru smiled as she set
        <p></p>the tray on the coffee table.
        <p></p>Amane sprung up from the sofa and moved to a cushion on the floor, gesturing for
        <p></p>Mahiru to sit down. She gingerly took the now-vacant seat, looking apologetic.
        <p></p>"But if you look good enough to gossip about," Chitose continued, "imagine how
        <p></p>popular you'd be if you dressed that way all the time."
        <p></p>"No way. It's a huge hassle, and I don't even wanna be popular in the first place."
        <p></p>"Whaaat? Not even with Valentine's Day coming up? Don't you want to get lots of
        <p></p>chocolate, Amane? Like, he's just one example, but Yuu's super popular, and it seems
        <p></p>like he gets tons of chocolates. Aren't you the slightest bit jealous?"
        <p></p>"No way. I'd get diabetes."
        <p></p>By Yuu, Chitose must have been referring to Yuuta. Assigning weird nicknames to
        <p></p>people seemed to be one of Chitose's many habits. Fortunately, she hadn't gotten
        <p></p>around to thinking of one for Amane.
        <p></p>Maybe Yuuta—dubbed the prince—did receive tons of chocolate, but there was no
        <p></p>way he could eat it all without getting fat.
        <p></p>"Anyway, it's depressing just to think about the returns," Amane added. "I mean,
        <p></p>between the chocolates people just give out to be polite and the ones people give out
        <p></p>to confess their feelings, Kadowaki's probably on the receiving end of several dozen
        <p></p>gifts, and then he has to pay all those back threefold. That's gotta be hell on a high
        <p></p>school student's wallet."
        <p></p>"How admirable to assume that he's going to pay everything back threefold. Well, I'm
        <p></p>going to give you some chocolate, and you don't need to worry about return gifts or
        <p></p>anything like that. What kind do you like?"
        <p></p>"I'm not really into sweet things, so… something not too sweet."
        <p></p>"Got it; I'll come up with something."
        <p></p>"Don't put anything funny in there."
        <p></p>"It's fine; it'll all be edible."
        <p></p>"Hey…"
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure what Chitose was planning, but he was definitely expecting
        <p></p>something more than an ordinary box of chocolates.
        <p></p>"Mahirun, who are you giving chocolate to?"
        <p></p>"The girls I'm friends with in my class."
        <p></p>"Not to any boys?"
        <p></p>"…If I give anyone chocolate, even courtesy chocolate, they take it the wrong way, so…"
        <p></p>"Ah-ha."
        <p></p>Amane could easily imagine the uproar among the boys—and the pointless fighting
        <p></p>that was sure to follow. Most of the boys in his class would treat chocolate from the
        <p></p>school angel like mana from heaven, so if word got around that Mahiru was giving out
        <p></p>chocolate, it would definitely mean trouble. Amane wasn't sure whether Mahiru's
        <p></p>popularity or the boys' foolishness was more to blame.
        <p></p>Obviously, it's safer for Mahiru to avoid giving out any chocolate at all.
        <p></p>Amane nodded and smiled to himself.
        <p></p>"Oh, and I'll also save some chocolate for you, Chitose."
        <p></p>"Yaaay! I love you, Mahirun. I'll give you some, too. The real stuff, not like what I'm
        <p></p>giving Amane."
        <p></p>"I heard that!"
        <p></p>Chitose was grinning widely as she squeezed Mahiru tight.
        <p></p>Amane was relieved to see the way she was touching Mahiru didn't constitute sexual
        <p></p>harassment, but he kept a sharp eye on Chitose to make it clear he wouldn't let her get
        <p></p>away with anything.
        <p></p>"I'm just joookiiing. I'm gonna give you the edible stuff, too, okay, Amane?"
        <p></p>"I have a feeling that edible and tasty are two very different things here…"
        <p></p>Amane pressed a hand to his forehead. He could feel a headache coming on. Chitose
        <p></p>was certainly excited about her latest plot. She didn't even try to hide her delight as
        <p></p>she laughed at Amane.
        <p></p>"I'm sure you'll enjoy your present!"
        <p></p>On Valentine's Day, as Amane had predicted, the mood at school was tense. Everyone
        <p></p>was restless; no one could settle down. Many people believed that a guys' social status
        <p></p>depended on whether he received chocolates on Valentine's Day. At the moment, most
        <p></p>of the boys were trying to act like they weren't desperately waiting for something.
        <p></p>"Everyone's all worked up, huh?"
        <p></p>It certainly seemed nerve-racking. Amane, on the other hand, didn't care a bit about
        <p></p>his social standing, so he had the privilege of watching the day pass through the eyes
        <p></p>of a remote observer. His attention turned to Itsuki, who also had nothing to worry
        <p></p>about today, though for a different reason.
        <p></p>"Looks that way," Itsuki answered, staring nonchalantly across the classroom.
        <p></p>"Mr. Itsuki, as a man with a girlfriend—a man who, I might add, appears totally calm
        <p></p>today—we'd like to ask for your opinion on this year's Valentine's Day proceedings."
        <p></p>"Well, Amane, the boys certainly look desperate. Understandable, considering that
        <p></p>whether they receive chocolates today can have major ramifications on their sense of
        <p></p>pride as men in the coming weeks. And let's not forget that approximately sixty percent
        <p></p>of these fine young fellows are, at this very moment, sweating over whether they
        <p></p>might receive chocolates from the lovely lady Shiina."
        <p></p>"…Apparently, she's not giving anything to the guys, not even courtesy chocolate. Since
        <p></p>it would get out of hand."
        <p></p>"Yeah, I guess it would… By the way, do you think you're getting anything from a
        <p></p>certain someone?"
        <p></p>"No idea. At least, I haven't seen any indication that I might."
        <p></p>Mahiru was giving chocolates to the girls but not the guys, so Amane didn't expect that
        <p></p>she was going to give him any. Of course, he would feel grateful if she did give him
        <p></p>some, but he was fine either way.
        <p></p>Honestly, as far as Amane was concerned, Valentine's Day was all just a big sales
        <p></p>promotion cooked up by confectionery companies, so it wasn't something he really
        <p></p>cared about.
        <p></p>Itsuki chuckled at his friend's obvious disinterest. "You sure are blunt, Amane." Then
        <p></p>his attention turned to a particularly lively corner of the classroom. "Now, that… That's
        <p></p>somethin', all right."
        <p></p>Itsuki was gesturing toward a handsome young man with a captivating smile
        <p></p>surrounded by a group of girls all jostling to hand him different bags and boxes of
        <p></p>chocolates.
        <p></p>Class hadn't even started yet, and already the bag that the boy had apparently brought
        <p></p>expressly as a receptacle was stuffed full of presents, undeniable proof of his
        <p></p>tremendous popularity.
        <p></p>"I don't know whether to say 'It figures' or what."
        <p></p>"You can just feel the hatred wafting off the other guys."
        <p></p>The boys shooting Yuuta envious looks or staring hopelessly into the distance likely
        <p></p>had not received anything from anyone yet. The difference between their social
        <p></p>standings was obvious.
        <p></p>It must be a real pain to have to carry home so much chocolate, Amane told himself,
        <p></p>wondering what he would even do with that much candy.
        <p></p>"Popular guys have it rough, huh? What do you think he even does with it all?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, seriously. I'm amazed he doesn't get fat. It's been like this ever since middle
        <p></p>school, but his figure hasn't changed at all."
        <p></p>"You can definitely tell he's a track-and-field guy. Well, at least that's a problem I won't
        <p></p>have to worry about."
        <p></p>"Not so fast. Chitose really outdid herself this time. You'd better prepare yourself."
        <p></p>"Whaddaya mean 'prepare myself'?"
        <p></p>"It's a Russian roulette."
        <p></p>"Knock it off. What'd she mix in?"
        <p></p>Their exchange the previous day heavily implied that Chitose wasn't planning to make
        <p></p>normal sweets, but Itsuki made it sound like she'd used some incredibly questionable
        <p></p>ingredients.
        <p></p>"Let's see, one piece is a three-in-one habanero, wasabi, and hot pepper chocolate.
        <p></p>Another has pickled plum concentrate jelly in it. And the rest are normal chocolate."
        <p></p>"What the hell has she created?"
        <p></p>"Apparently, she wanted to surprise you, Amane."
        <p></p>In a certain sense, he was surprised, but it was mostly in the about to faint sense.
        <p></p>"…Now I'm afraid to eat them."
        <p></p>"Surrender all hope. I've already walked this thorny path."
        <p></p>"I bet you ate them all for a laugh."
        <p></p>"Maybe. As long as Chi makes it, I'll eat anything."
        <p></p>"You two sicken me."
        <p></p>Itsuki might put whatever Chitose offered him into his mouth without a second
        <p></p>thought, but Amane wasn't so trusting.
        <p></p>Chitose wasn't actually all that bad at cooking; the problem was that she always got
        <p></p>carried away with her next grand idea. She was perfectly capable of preparing entirely
        <p></p>ordinary dishes; she just chose to create culinary calamities sometimes.
        <p></p>While her main victim was Itsuki, Amane was surprised to suddenly find himself in
        <p></p>the crosshairs. That said, from the way Itsuki was acting, he didn't think it could be
        <p></p>too terrible. There was probably nothing to worry about, despite the agonized faces
        <p></p>that Itsuki was making.
        <p></p>Still, Amane couldn't help but shake a strange feeling of melancholy.
        <p></p>"Okay, Amane, here you go!" Chitose said, handing him his chocolates. She had caught
        <p></p>up with Amane and Itsuki in their classroom after school.
        <p></p>"…Thank you," Amane replied somewhat reluctantly.
        <p></p>He didn't want to seem ungrateful, though he had to admit he was a little concerned
        <p></p>about the chocolates she had made. He was still going to eat them all, obviously, but
        <p></p>he wasn't looking forward to finding the super-spicy and super-sour chocolates she'd
        <p></p>apparently hidden in the batch.
        <p></p>"I'm sure you've heard from Itsuki, but be ready for something exciting!"
        <p></p>"I don't really like spicy food…"
        <p></p>"It's not that bad, you wuss! I taste tested everything myself. In fact, I thought the hot
        <p></p>one was actually really good!"
        <p></p>"Yeah, but you like spicy stuff…," Amane moaned. "Geez…"
        <p></p>Amane didn't like spicy or sour food. It was like Chitose had gone out of her way to
        <p></p>include flavors that Amane couldn't handle. On the other hand, the rest of the
        <p></p>chocolates were sure to be really delicious, so…
        <p></p>"Oh, and there's also a super-sweet one and a super-bitter one mixed in."
        <p></p>"Thanks for the warning…," Amane groaned. It was just like Chitose to add in a few
        <p></p>extra land mines at the last minute.
        <p></p>The super-sweet one probably featured condensed milk, while the super-bitter one
        <p></p>was probably made of close to 99 percent cacao chocolate. That actually didn't sound
        <p></p>too bad. Amane handled bitter foods better than most.
        <p></p>Apparently, this was the first time Itsuki was hearing this, and his face twitched as he
        <p></p>murmured, "Chi… you're unbelievable…"
        <p></p>Chitose continued smiling. "It'll be fine. There's even a special palate cleanser in there."
        <p></p>"And what might that be?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"All right, we're going now, bye-byeee." Without answering Amane's question, Chitose
        <p></p>grabbed Itsuki's hand and walked off. Apparently, they had a Valentine's date to get to.
        <p></p>"Good luck, man!" Itsuki offered as he was pulled away.
        <p></p>Amane let out an exhausted sigh and waved good-bye. After watching them disappear
        <p></p>from sight, he pulled on his coat, thinking it was about time for him to head home, too,
        <p></p>and picked up his bag from the hook on the side of his desk.
        <p></p>Amane usually didn't mind being alone, but today he felt out of place among all the
        <p></p>lovesick boys and girls. He shouldered his bag and glanced around the room.
        <p></p>The flurry of gift giving seemed to have finally subsided. Yuuta sat staring vacantly at
        <p></p>the enormous pile of presents on his desk. The other boys in the class could only
        <p></p>dream of such a hoard, and the bag hanging from the side of his desk was stuffed full
        <p></p>of even more treasures.
        <p></p>Amane could guess what was weighing on Yuuta's mind and couldn't help but feel bad
        <p></p>for him. He approached the other boy's desk.
        <p></p>"Kadowaki?"
        <p></p>"Hmm? Ah, Fujimiya. What's up?"
        <p></p>They had been classmates for almost a year, so he remembered Amane's name, even
        <p></p>though Amane didn't have much of a presence in class.
        <p></p>He had never taken the initiative to talk to Yuuta before, outside of a few group
        <p></p>assignments, and the other boy seemed curious about the sudden interaction.
        <p></p>Amane responded to his confusion with an awkward smile, then undid the zipper of a
        <p></p>small pocket on the front of his bag.
        <p></p>"Nothing in particular, just, here—"
        <p></p>From the pocket, Amane pulled out several plastic supermarket bags, folded into
        <p></p>compact triangles, and tossed them to Yuuta.
        <p></p>Mahiru had put them there and told him, "Keep a few of these in your bag. That way
        <p></p>you'll have them whenever you need them." He had imagined he might use them for
        <p></p>garbage or maybe in case of motion sickness, but he'd never expected them to come
        <p></p>in handy like this.
        <p></p>Looking perplexed by the strange bundles, Yuuta unfolded one of the triangles to
        <p></p>reveal a relatively large disposable shopping bag. The plastic didn't look particularly
        <p></p>durable, but Amane decided that Yuuta would just have to manage somehow.
        <p></p>"Did I… uh… read the situation wrong?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"N-no…," Yuuta replied. "You're right on target, but—"
        <p></p>"Great. Well, good luck with all that." Reflecting on the many hazards of popularity,
        <p></p>Amane waved good-bye and left the classroom.
        <p></p>Later, Yuuta was spotted around the school carrying several shopping bags stuffed to
        <p></p>bursting.
        <p></p>Though it was Valentine's Day, that didn't mean that there was anything special in the
        <p></p>air at home, and Amane went back to his apartment to relax just like always.
        <p></p>It was too early to start making dinner, so he and Mahiru lounged beside each other
        <p></p>on the couch. She didn't seem excited or on edge in any way, and Amane took this as a
        <p></p>sign that she was definitely not planning anything special today.
        <p></p>He didn't mind, since he wasn't expecting anything in the first place, but couldn't quite
        <p></p>dispel the slight disappointment that he chalked up to his manly pride.
        <p></p>"There was a sweet smell hanging over the school today, huh?" Amane remarked.
        <p></p>"It is Valentine's Day," Mahiru replied.
        <p></p>Amane had heard a lot of disappointed grumbling coming from the boys in his class.
        <p></p>Mahiru had only given chocolates to her female friends—she hadn't even handed out
        <p></p>courtesy chocolates to the boys.
        <p></p>Amane wondered why any of them had assumed they might receive anything in the
        <p></p>first place—it wasn't like they had any kind of relationship with her… but nevertheless,
        <p></p>they had high hopes.
        <p></p>"Well, Valentine's Day really only matters to the popular guys anyway. It's got nothing
        <p></p>to do with lackluster guys like me…"
        <p></p>"How very perceptive of you," Mahiru remarked.
        <p></p>"I'm not exactly proud to say this," Amane continued unprompted, "but I've never
        <p></p>received a romantic gift from anyone. Though, I did just get some Russian roulette
        <p></p>courtesy chocolates from Chitose."
        <p></p>"Russian roulette courtesy chocolates?"
        <p></p>"Apparently, mixed in among the normal chocolates are some… exciting concoctions."
        <p></p>It was impossible to tell the super-spicy, super-sour, super-sweet, and super-bitter
        <p></p>chocolates from the rest, and any one of them seemed capable of obliterating his sense
        <p></p>of taste. Amane was kind of afraid to start eating at all.
        <p></p>"Another amazing creation…"
        <p></p>"Well, I'll eat them later, but please show some sympathy if you find me rolling around
        <p></p>in agony."
        <p></p>"You're going to eat them all?"
        <p></p>"The thing is… She sorta made them just for me, so I kinda feel obligated to eat them.
        <p></p>Besides, it's not like they're poisonous or anything."
        <p></p>The chocolates might be extra stimulating, but it wasn't like they would cause him any
        <p></p>real harm, and Chitose had gone out of her way to make and deliver them, so he was
        <p></p>one hundred percent planning to eat them all with gratitude in his heart. Still, the
        <p></p>exciting ingredients made him rather nervous.
        <p></p>"…Is that how it is?" Mahiru muttered.
        <p></p>"Well, it's not like I got any other chocolates, and for a loner like me, Valentine's Day
        <p></p>doesn't mean much besides an excuse to eat some candy."
        <p></p>Amane was perfectly content with a single courtesy gift. He was already worried about
        <p></p>the day one month from now when he would have to repay Chitose's present and
        <p></p>wondered what he should get her.
        <p></p>Mahiru simply stared at him silently.
        <p></p>After dinner, Amane decided to sample one of Chitose's chocolates and ended up
        <p></p>facedown on his desk in agony.
        <p></p>Chitose had arranged evenly spaced partitions containing twelve truffles inside the
        <p></p>box. There were four varieties of "surprise" chocolate. That meant he had a one-in-three
        <p></p>chance of picking something that would give his taste buds the shock of a lifetime.
        <p></p>Among those, the worst was sure to be the super-spicy one. Amane figured that he
        <p></p>could handle the rest without too much trouble, but—
        <p></p>"You found one, didn't you?" Mahiru asked in a sympathetic tone. She had been in the
        <p></p>kitchen preparing drinks and returned to find Amane in obvious distress.
        <p></p>"…I was planning to eat them all over a few days, and this is what I get…"
        <p></p>Amane quickly quaffed his drink, but the inside of his mouth was beyond hot. This
        <p></p>went beyond having a low tolerance for spicy food—he was in real pain here. It wasn't
        <p></p>more than he could handle, but it was still pretty intense.
        <p></p>As the characteristically sharp sting of wasabi shot through his nose, Amane found
        <p></p>himself thinking how impressive it was that Chitose had managed to include so much
        <p></p>of the volatile component. He cursed her name while trying to hold back the
        <p></p>instinctive tears.
        <p></p>The wasabi attacked his nose and eyes, while the habanero powder and hot pepper
        <p></p>burned his tongue. A single nibble of these intense flavors—or rather, intense
        <p></p>torments—was enough to ruin him.
        <p></p>"My condolences," Mahiru said. "But think of it this way—if you make it through hell
        <p></p>first, the rest will be heaven."
        <p></p>Easy for her to say. Amane was still in agony. He heard a soft sigh and then the sound
        <p></p>of something hard being set down beside him.
        <p></p>"Here, this should help."
        <p></p>When he raised his head, there was a mug beside him, filled with a dark-brown liquid,
        <p></p>giving off steam and a sweet aroma.
        <p></p>"Cocoa?"
        <p></p>"Something like that. It's called chocolat chaud. It's French hot chocolate. I made it
        <p></p>fairly sweet. It should help cleanse your palate."
        <p></p>"I'm saved…"
        <p></p>Right now, the only thing Amane wanted to do was to wash away this pain.
        <p></p>As Amane tipped the contents of the mug into his mouth, a rich flavor enveloped his
        <p></p>senses. The liquid had the luscious fragrance of full-bodied chocolate but was actually
        <p></p>not that sweet. It tasted like dark chocolate and possessed a calming flavor that went
        <p></p>down very easily.
        <p></p>"It's great."
        <p></p>"I'm glad to hear it."
        <p></p>Amane slowly sipped the hot chocolate, attempting to soothe the pain in his mouth.
        <p></p>The truffle hadn't actually contained very much of the spicy mixture. It had mostly
        <p></p>been ganache coated in a thick layer of chocolate and covered in powdered sugar. The
        <p></p>weaponized sweet packed a big kick up front, but the impact faded as time went on.
        <p></p>By the time Amane had drained his mug, he was left with only a slight tingle on his
        <p></p>tongue.
        <p></p>"Sigh… She really outdid herself…"
        <p></p>"Was it really that spicy?"
        <p></p>"I mean, it had pepper and wasabi and habanero in it, so yeah. Damn… I'm glad you
        <p></p>made that palate cleanser, but I think I would've died if I ate any more."
        <p></p>"Well, I suppose there's no harm done."
        <p></p>"Good grief."
        <p></p>Even as he cursed Chitose's name under his breath, he knew that she had tried in her
        <p></p>own way to surprise him, so he couldn't really be upset with her. All the chocolates
        <p></p>besides the special four probably tasted normal, so it wasn't like there was any malice
        <p></p>behind it. And she had even tried all the exotic ingredients herself. Amane could do
        <p></p>nothing but smile bitterly.
        <p></p>"Anyway, the hot chocolate was a nice surprise. Usually you stick to hot milk, right?"
        <p></p>"…Yes, well…"
        <p></p>"Did you decide to make this because it's Valentine's Day?" Amane asked hopefully.
        <p></p>Mahiru basically always drank hot milk or milk tea, so the cocoa was unexpected.
        <p></p>"…Maybe."
        <p></p>"Well, thank you. You're a lifesaver."
        <p></p>Mahiru responded with a small nod, and Amane breathed a quiet sigh of relief.
        <p></p>He had gone out on a limb there, and if she had shot him down, he would have looked
        <p></p>like a real idiot. But apparently, he'd been right on the money. Mahiru had wanted to
        <p></p>do something special for Valentine's Day after all. Amane was sure there wasn't any
        <p></p>deeper meaning to it than that, but he was still grateful.
        <p></p>"It was delicious," he said again.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed uncomfortable.
        <p></p>"Is something the matter?" he prodded.
        <p></p>"…Um, well—"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>Amane knew that sitting beside her and pressing her for an answer would probably
        <p></p>just make it harder for her to tell him, so he tried to be patient and listen instead.
        <p></p>Mahiru hugged one of the pillows over half her face as she stared up at him anxiously.
        <p></p>She looked like a small and strangely adorable animal, which made Amane want to
        <p></p>smile and reach out and pat her on the head. He continued waiting, but instead of
        <p></p>continuing her thought, Mahiru simply trembled silently.
        <p></p>Then she stood up suddenly and grabbed her bags.
        <p></p>"…I'm… going home."
        <p></p>By the time Amane let out a noise of surprise, Mahiru had already slipped out of the
        <p></p>living room. He was frozen in place as he listened to the sound of her receding
        <p></p>footsteps, then the front door opening and closing, and finally the sound of the lock
        <p></p>turning. In a flash, Mahiru was gone.
        <p></p>He couldn't help letting out a confused noise at this quick work. "Eh…?"
        <p></p>Did I do something wrong…?
        <p></p>His heart was torn between surprise at her unexpected departure and worry that he
        <p></p>had inadvertently driven her away. He stood up, thinking about what he should do if
        <p></p>Mahiru was still in a bad mood when he saw her tomorrow, and went to check the
        <p></p>front door. Suddenly, he caught sight of a light-pink paper bag hanging from the
        <p></p>doorknob of his room. Mahiru must have left it there.
        <p></p>Inside the bag was a pastel-pink box tied with a chocolate-colored ribbon, and there
        <p></p>was a card affixed to the front with a sticker. The handwriting was smooth and neat.
        <p></p>Thank you for always being there for me. Please accept this with my gratitude.
        <p></p>Amane realized why she had left the bag there. Just handing it to him would have been
        <p></p>too awkward, especially after she had decided not to give chocolate to any other boys.
        <p></p>She could have just given it to me…
        <p></p>Smiling gently at how surprisingly timid Mahiru could be in these sorts of situations,
        <p></p>Amane sat back down on the sofa and examined the contents of the bag.
        <p></p>The adorable wrapping paper reminded him of Mahiru's sophisticated yet feminine
        <p></p>style.
        <p></p>Amane figured it was all right for him to go ahead and open it, and with some
        <p></p>apprehension, he slowly unwrapped the box.
        <p></p>Inside were candied orange rings dipped in chocolate, each individually wrapped in
        <p></p>plastic—in other words, orangettes.
        <p></p>The contrast between the bright color and the deep luster of the chocolate was dazzling
        <p></p>to the eye, and the box even included a few with white chocolate coating, and some
        <p></p>used lemon peels instead of oranges. They looked delicious, and Amane appreciated
        <p></p>the variety.
        <p></p>There was a second card accompanying the Orangettes.
        <p></p>You don't seem to like sweet things too much, so I made you something that I thought
        <p></p>would better suit your tastes. I hope you like it.
        <p></p>He recalled a conversation from about ten days earlier.
        <p></p>"What kind do you like?"
        <p></p>"I'm not really into sweet things, so… something not too sweet."
        <p></p>Apparently, Mahiru had remembered his conversation with Chitose perfectly and
        <p></p>picked something that would match his tastes. Amane suddenly felt very self-conscious.
        <p></p>He hadn't expected to receive anything at all, and here she had selected something
        <p></p>especially for him. It was typical of the sensitive, considerate Mahiru. Amane could feel
        <p></p>himself starting to blush just thinking about it.
        <p></p>He reached down and picked up one of the orangettes, appreciating the beautiful
        <p></p>colors as he unwrapped the candy and slowly took a bite. The sugary and astringent
        <p></p>bite of the candied orange peel melded perfectly with the pleasantly bitter chocolate
        <p></p>in his mouth, each flavor complimenting the other in a splendid harmony.
        <p></p>…So good…
        <p></p>Amane marveled at how Mahiru's handmade confections were much better than
        <p></p>anything he'd ever gotten from the store as he took another bite.
        <p></p>Mahiru's orangettes were a little sour, a little bitter—and intensely sweet.
        <p></p>"Hey, Fujimiya, thanks for yesterday."
        <p></p>The following morning, Yuuta casually approached Amane at school. He seemed
        <p></p>cheerful and friendly, but Amane couldn't help but feel nervous talking to him. Even
        <p></p>though they had briefly spoken the day before, Amane never would have expected him
        <p></p>to go out of his way to come say thanks just for that.
        <p></p>A few people shot them curious glances, which only made Amane even more nervous.
        <p></p>He didn't like being the center of attention.
        <p></p>"Oh, don't worry about it. You looked like you were having a hard time."
        <p></p>"Well, yeah…" Yuuta got a faraway look in his eyes
        <p></p>"I bet being a popular guy is really tough, huh?" Amane tried to sympathize.
        <p></p>Yuuta was clearly aware of his popularity, but it wasn't the kind of thing he would ever
        <p></p>flaunt. That was part of why everybody liked him—and why even the most jealous
        <p></p>boys couldn't bring themselves to truly hate him. He was the kind of guy who would
        <p></p>come over and thank you for something as trivial as a plastic bag.
        <p></p>"Anyway, it was a big help. Just wanted to say thanks."
        <p></p>"Don't mention it. Glad I could help a guy in need."
        <p></p>He hadn't offered to help so that Yuuta would owe him or anything. Amane smiled to
        <p></p>show that he thought it was no big deal, and Yuuta smiled back, looking relieved. The
        <p></p>girls in the class all squealed. Amane couldn't help but laugh bitterly as he wished that
        <p></p>Yuuta would save his smile for his admirers.
        <p></p>"What did you do for Yuuta?" Itsuki asked after Yuuta left. Apparently, he had been
        <p></p>watching the exchange.
        <p></p>"Kadowaki had too much chocolate, so I gave him a couple plastic bags."
        <p></p>"Ah. So he ended up with more than he expected. Shoulda come prepared." Itsuki
        <p></p>smiled sympathetically.
        <p></p>The two of them had watched Yuuta pile up the presents and agreed that he would
        <p></p>probably have a hard time making it home with the whole score. Itsuki wasn't
        <p></p>surprised that Amane had decided to help out.
        <p></p>As far as Amane was concerned, it was really just a small gesture. Nothing worth going
        <p></p>out of your way to say thank you for.
        <p></p>"Well, that's all it was. Nothing too important."
        <p></p>"That's just like you, man… But wait, you're keeping a bunch of old plastic bags
        <p></p>around? Aren't you getting a little too engrossed in the domestic life? When I saw you
        <p></p>scanning grocery store ads on your phone, I thought you were somebody's housewife."
        <p></p>"Hey, whose wife is that supposed to be? Last time I checked, I was still a man. Though,
        <p></p>I'll admit that maybe I've been heavily influenced by you-know-who…"
        <p></p>Without a doubt, he could say it was all Mahiru's fault. The two of them were splitting
        <p></p>food expenses, so he had been checking online ads, thinking he had better get the best
        <p></p>deals he could, then suggesting things they could make from whatever was on sale.
        <p></p>Apparently, that reminded Itsuki more of a housewife than a husband. Though he did
        <p></p>leave the cooking entirely up to Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Must be nice to have a partner to play house."
        <p></p>"She's not really my partner. And what about Chitose?"
        <p></p>"Chi? Well, sure. So long as I can keep her from getting carried away with her weird
        <p></p>experiments anyway. I mean, she knows how to cook, for sure."
        <p></p>"…Does she ever make anything that's not weird?"
        <p></p>"That's just part of her charm, all right?" Itsuki's eyes darted from side to side.
        <p></p>"Whatever you need to tell yourself, man."
        <p></p>For better or worse, there was rarely a dull moment with Chitose. She might've looked
        <p></p>like an ordinary high school girl, and apparently she even had some surprising talents
        <p></p>on the home front, but when the mood struck her, she was liable to cause all sorts of
        <p></p>trouble.
        <p></p>"Well, it sounds like she's going to get it together after we're married, so—"
        <p></p>"How long do you think it's going to take to get your dad to accept her…?"
        <p></p>Itsuki's father, who was oddly strict about dating in a way that you didn't see much
        <p></p>these days, had never approved of Chitose. He would definitely have something to say
        <p></p>if he heard that they were planning to get married.
        <p></p>Chitose's parents, on the other hand, were apparently ready to welcome Itsuki into
        <p></p>the family at any time, which always confused Amane… Wasn't it usually the other way
        <p></p>around?
        <p></p>"Well, once we're adults, he'll have to come around. I'll threaten him with not seeing
        <p></p>his grandkids and all that. This is one fight where I can't back down and just do what
        <p></p>my dad wants."
        <p></p>Itsuki made a show of shrugging like he didn't think much of it, but Amane noticed the
        <p></p>serious look in his eyes. He was obviously not planning to budge on this issue.
        <p></p>Amane had always understood the extent to which Itsuki loved Chitose, so he chose to
        <p></p>encourage them, admiring how amazing it was that they were thinking about
        <p></p>marriage even while they were still in high school.
        <p></p>"…Well, I think you're probably not one to back down until you've got a ring on her
        <p></p>finger, so I wish you the best of luck."
        <p></p>"Yeah. And good luck to you, too," Itsuki replied.
        <p></p>"At what?"
        <p></p>"I mean, with you-know-who… Right?"
        <p></p>"…I don't really have that kind of relationship with her. Don't make things up."
        <p></p>Amane turned away sharply, but he could hear Itsuki's bright, cheerful laughter.
        <p></p>Amane purchased everything he needed at the supermarket and headed home. When
        <p></p>he got there, Mahiru was already in his apartment, sitting on the sofa, waiting in her
        <p></p>usual spot. She had her knees pulled up and was squeezing a cushion to her chest. The
        <p></p>position made her look a little childish, but her expression wasn't sulky or dour.
        <p></p>Rather, she looked embarrassed.
        <p></p>Well, thank goodness she's wearing a long skirt, Amane thought as he carefully averted
        <p></p>his eyes and went to put the dinner ingredients away in the refrigerator. When he
        <p></p>returned to the living room, Mahiru was still sitting there waiting for him.
        <p></p>When Amane sat down next to her, Mahiru carefully averted her eyes.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, thank you for the gift yesterday. It was really delicious."
        <p></p>"…I'm glad to hear it."
        <p></p>Amane thought that if she was nervous about what happened yesterday, the best thing
        <p></p>to do was to show her how much he appreciated it. Mahiru continued squeezing the
        <p></p>cushion but didn't say anything else.
        <p></p>"What would you like in return?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"That's not why I gave it to you…"
        <p></p>"I know that, but well, give a favor, get a favor, right? It wouldn't be very gentlemanly
        <p></p>of me if all I do is take, take, take."
        <p></p>Amane believed that a man should always strive to pay back whatever he received.
        <p></p>Since Mahiru had gone out of her way to make him such delicious treats, he intended
        <p></p>to give her something equally splendid in return. She hadn't made chocolates for any
        <p></p>other boy, after all, yet she had made something special that she knew he would like.
        <p></p>It must have been a lot of work, all for his sake.
        <p></p>"…I already get so many things from you, Amane."
        <p></p>"Actually, I'm pretty sure I'm the one who's been on the receiving end. You're always
        <p></p>cooking for me and stuff. I always feel like I'm just taking advantage of you."
        <p></p>"I do those things because I like doing them. Amane, you probably don't even realize
        <p></p>how much you've done for me. But as far as I'm concerned, I've already received more
        <p></p>than enough, so I don't need anything else."
        <p></p>Amane genuinely could not imagine what he might have offered Mahiru. It seemed
        <p></p>like she was always doing things for him, and he wanted to pay her back for all her
        <p></p>kindness… but the tally was apparently very different from Mahiru's perspective.
        <p></p>"Well, that is that, and this is this. I'll try to think of something you might like."
        <p></p>No matter what Amane might have done for her until now, he still wanted to get her a
        <p></p>White Day present. It was tradition to repay any Valentine's Day chocolates on White
        <p></p>Day, after all.
        <p></p>Amane stared firmly at Mahiru, indicating that he had no intention of giving in on this,
        <p></p>until she nodded, her eyes wandering around the room a bit.
        <p></p>"…Fine."
        <p></p>"All right, so I've got about a month to figure out what to give you. It would be great if
        <p></p>I could find something that you would really like."
        <p></p>"…Do you have time for a search like that?" Mahiru asked, sounding slightly
        <p></p>exasperated. "Next week we have final exams, and then right after, there's the closing
        <p></p>ceremony."
        <p></p>Sure enough, finals were only days away.
        <p></p>There had still been a lingering aftertaste of Valentine's Day at school that day, but
        <p></p>soon it would be replaced with the typical prickly energy of pre-exam anxiety.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't particularly nervous about it, though.
        <p></p>"If the exams go the same as usual," he said, "I'm sure I'll pass, so I'm not going to stress
        <p></p>about them now. Same for you, I bet."
        <p></p>"That's true," Mahiru replied. "I make a point to get my work done with time to spare."
        <p></p>Amane was always diligent when it came to keeping up with his classwork, so he rarely
        <p></p>had any trouble with tests. He knew he could maintain his usual grades without any
        <p></p>last-minute cram sessions. At most, he might spend a little extra time reviewing the
        <p></p>material right before each test.
        <p></p>Mahiru had actually already completed all the coursework in advance, and she was
        <p></p>just as diligent about studying as Amane was, so he had never seen her panic about
        <p></p>schoolwork. Instead, exam days with their shortened schedules were probably like
        <p></p>half days for her.
        <p></p>"Well, don't expect too much."
        <p></p>"…Okay. I'll treasure anything you give me."
        <p></p>"Hey, don't get carried away now."
        <p></p>"I've been taking very good care of Mr. Bear."
        <p></p>"I'm glad to hear it." Amane smiled.
        <p></p>Apparently, Mahiru really treasured the stuffed bear he had given her on her birthday.
        <p></p>He had also seen her using the key holder, and she seemed to be taking good care of
        <p></p>that as well. He had worried a little bit about how the stuffed bear was faring, but…
        <p></p>from all indications, Mahiru really liked it.
        <p></p>Amane could feel his mouth curling up into a grin when he heard Mahiru cutely refer
        <p></p>to Mr. Bear, but he thought she might scowl at him if she caught him smiling, so he put
        <p></p>on his best poker face.
        <p></p>If we're still hanging out when her next birthday rolls around, what sort of thing can I
        <p></p>give her…? he wondered anxiously.
        <p></p>Suddenly, Amane noticed that Mahiru was staring at him.
        <p></p>"…Come to think of it, I don't know when your birthday is," she said.
        <p></p>"Uh, mine? Mine is November eighth."
        <p></p>Guess I never told her, huh?
        <p></p>When she heard his birthday, Mahiru's eyes narrowed… ever so slightly. They had been
        <p></p>spending a lot of time together for several months, so he had come to understand that
        <p></p>expression as the one she made when she was angry or annoyed.
        <p></p>"…Hey, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"Didn't we already know each other by then?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, I guess so."
        <p></p>"Why didn't you say anything?"
        <p></p>"Because you never asked. You didn't tell me your birthday, either, remember? I only
        <p></p>knew because I saw it on your school ID."
        <p></p>"Urk—"
        <p></p>"And we weren't that close back then anyway. If I had told you my birthday, you would
        <p></p>have wondered why in the world I was bringing it up."
        <p></p>Also, Amane hadn't wanted to come across like he was fishing for a present or
        <p></p>anything. That would not have been a good look. So he hadn't seen the need to tell her
        <p></p>about his birthday—they hadn't had that kind of relationship back then.
        <p></p>"…But—"
        <p></p>"You really don't have to worry about it," Amane insisted.
        <p></p>"Fine…," Mahiru said. "But we'll definitely celebrate your birthday properly this year."
        <p></p>As she said that, she turned to him and grasped his sleeve tightly.
        <p></p>Mahiru obviously didn't want this unequal situation to continue. He had never seen
        <p></p>someone so serious about a birthday before.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help but grin—not his normal, wry smirk, but an honest, happy smile.
        <p></p>After all, nothing could make him happier than hearing that Mahiru felt the same way
        <p></p>he did… and that she was thinking about spending time together in the future.
        <p></p>"So you're planning to stay with me at least that long, are you?" he prodded.
        <p></p>Mahiru's bright, caramel-colored eyes went wide—and then, in an instant, her face
        <p></p>flushed red, and where she had been gripping his sleeve a moment ago, she whacked
        <p></p>him with the cushion, obviously trying to hide her embarrassment. Amane could feel
        <p></p>himself smiling again at how charming she was.
        <p></p>"…Well, I suppose I don't hate the thought… I always feel so calm when we're together.
        <p></p>It's nice."
        <p></p>"Oh really? Thanks."
        <p></p>"But you know I don't really… have any other intentions."
        <p></p>"I knew that already." Amane nodded. "And that's fine with me."
        <p></p>For some reason, Mahiru looked slightly disappointed.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 22: White Day 
        <p></p>Amane was always diligent with his studies and serious about his lessons, so he
        <p></p>completed his final exams without any particular difficulty.
        <p></p>Going over his tests with Mahiru, he found that he'd gotten the same grades as usual.
        <p></p>He always did well enough at school and never had to worry about being held back a
        <p></p>grade or anything like that.
        <p></p>Itsuki also got fairly good scores, and even Chitose had apparently done well enough
        <p></p>to avoid a failing mark, so the people Amane was closest to were in no danger of
        <p></p>repeating a year, either.
        <p></p>All that was left was the graduation ceremony to send off the third-year students, which
        <p></p>didn't have much to do with them, and after that, to wait for the closing ceremony.
        <p></p>Between the two ceremonies, however, was one very important date.
        <p></p>"…What do I give her?"
        <p></p>The day was fast approaching for all those who had prevailed on Valentine's Day to
        <p></p>repay their gifts. Both Mahiru and Chitose had given Amane chocolates, so naturally
        <p></p>he was planning to give them each something in return. The only problem was that he
        <p></p>had no idea what to give Mahiru.
        <p></p>Chitose's gift was easy enough—he planned to combine a White Day cake from the
        <p></p>store where she had purchased their Christmas cake with a sundry of merchandise
        <p></p>based on the characters she liked.
        <p></p>He was sure that someone like Chitose, who was more interested in sweets than
        <p></p>sweethearts, would appreciate that. It was an obvious choice.
        <p></p>But Mahiru remained a dilemma.
        <p></p>Amane was sure that Mahiru would graciously accept anything he got her—the thought
        <p></p>mattered more to her than the actual gift. But he wanted to pick out something that
        <p></p>would make her really happy. The trouble was that he honestly didn't know much
        <p></p>about the kinds of things she liked. He knew she had a taste for sweets and liked cute
        <p></p>stuff like most other girls, but beyond that, he was lost. Mahiru was not an easy person
        <p></p>to shop for.
        <p></p>Amane remembered her telling him that she wanted a new whetstone, but that didn't
        <p></p>seem like a particularly charming gift, and he couldn't really afford something like that
        <p></p>anyway. And for this occasion, it seemed more appropriate to give her something she
        <p></p>would enjoy, rather than something practical.
        <p></p>Amane started his search by looking over the White Day display at a nearby department
        <p></p>store, but he couldn't picture Mahiru being truly happy with any of the things there.
        <p></p>Amane was hoping for a reaction like he'd gotten when he'd given her the stuffed bear.
        <p></p>Of course, it would be boring to give her a stuffed animal a second time.
        <p></p>There were many adorable stuffed animals on display, but Amane decided that a
        <p></p>repeat gift lacked originality.
        <p></p>On the other hand, when he tried to imagine what would impress her, Amane's poor
        <p></p>imagination could only come up with cosmetics or fashion accessories.
        <p></p>But he knew less than nothing about cosmetics, and he wasn't sure whether they had
        <p></p>the kind of relationship where he could confidently pick out fashionable things for her.
        <p></p>He didn't think she would interpret it as anything strange, but he wasn't sure it would
        <p></p>really impress her, either.
        <p></p>Amane thought that their relationship was pretty good, and if he were Itsuki and she
        <p></p>were Chitose, an accessory would be an obvious choice, but Amane just didn't think it
        <p></p>was the right move here.
        <p></p>Racked with worry, Amane lingered restlessly by the gifts corner. He imagined that he
        <p></p>must look awfully suspicious. Even though he had taken the precaution of dressing up
        <p></p>to go out, he thought that a single guy hanging around the cute goods had to seem
        <p></p>shady.
        <p></p>He was grumbling to himself about his options, when from behind him a voice asked,
        <p></p>"Are you looking for anything in particular?"
        <p></p>When Amane turned around, there was a young woman in a store apron standing
        <p></p>there smiling. She had probably noticed his distress as he helplessly wandered the
        <p></p>aisles.
        <p></p>"Ah, um… I'm not sure what to get for a White Day present."
        <p></p>"So nothing in the display jumps out at you? Well, there are some things in our regular
        <p></p>stock that are also popular White Day gifts. Let me show you."
        <p></p>"Ah, no, that's not exactly it… You see, our relationship is rather hard to define, and I'm
        <p></p>not sure what I can get her that won't be… too much."
        <p></p>"Meaning what?"
        <p></p>"Well, she's not my girlfriend, but we are pretty close, so… this is just an example, but
        <p></p>I'm wondering whether she would be happy to get an accessory or something from a
        <p></p>guy she doesn't like… that way."
        <p></p>As Amane explained his predicament, the store clerk let a little giggle slip out. She
        <p></p>seemed to find his dilemma quite charming.
        <p></p>"I've seen a lot of gentlemen come through here with the same sort of worries."
        <p></p>"So what did they end up doing?"
        <p></p>"They were all worried, too, but most of them decided to buy something. If you're close
        <p></p>to this girl, she'll probably appreciate anything you give her."
        <p></p>Amane felt relieved to hear someone else say that, though of course the prospect of
        <p></p>picking an accessory for Mahiru was still fairly daunting.
        <p></p>She was very particular about her attire, and the bits and pieces he had seen her
        <p></p>wearing before had all been quite elegant. Amane had no confidence that he could
        <p></p>select something that would meet the standards of such a sophisticated young woman.
        <p></p>"Sir, would you like me to show you some of the items in the corner over there that are
        <p></p>popular with our female customers?"
        <p></p>"…Yes, please," Amane said gratefully, straightening up a little.
        <p></p>"And so you bought something?"
        <p></p>When Amane told Itsuki about his shopping trip, his friend looked at him and laughed
        <p></p>pretty much the same way the clerk had the day before.
        <p></p>The two of them were eating lunch together in the cafeteria, and when the topic of
        <p></p>White Day came up, Amane had spilled the beans.
        <p></p>"Geez, keep it down!" Amane insisted. "Anyway, I was worried that giving her an
        <p></p>accessory might weird her out, since we're not dating."
        <p></p>"You're such a coward! A man should have more nerve, more spirit! And anyway, I have
        <p></p>a feeling that she'll be happy with anything as long as it comes from you, ya know?"
        <p></p>"…I guess so, but…"
        <p></p>Mahiru was the kind of girl who would graciously accept any gift, but Amane wanted
        <p></p>to give her a present that she would genuinely enjoy and want to use, so he had been
        <p></p>stressing out trying to choose something good.
        <p></p>"So what did you end up buying?"
        <p></p>"…A rose-gold bracelet with a flower pattern."
        <p></p>He had thought that the soft warmth of the rose gold would suit her better than coollooking silver or extravagant yellow gold. Of course, he was just in high school, so he
        <p></p>couldn't afford real precious metals, so it was only gold-plated, but he had been careful
        <p></p>to select a design that seemed to suit Mahiru's style.
        <p></p>"Really? That seems like exactly the kind of thing she'll like, man."
        <p></p>"…She won't be weirded out?"
        <p></p>"No way; you're worrying too much. Why are you always so negative about this
        <p></p>stuff…?"
        <p></p>"She's the only girl I've ever seriously thought about giving a present to."
        <p></p>His mother didn't count, and he wasn't thinking of Chitose, either. And anyway, he'd
        <p></p>only gotten Chitose a confection that he already knew she liked, so that present felt
        <p></p>like it was on a different level.
        <p></p>"You really don't have any confidence with this stuff, huh…?"
        <p></p>"And why should I? I mean… it's Mahiru!"
        <p></p>"She was happy with the teddy bear, right?"
        <p></p>"Well, that's true, but—"
        <p></p>"Amane, it's all about feeling, man, feeling. You've already spent the cash and chosen
        <p></p>the gift, so all that's left now is to put some emotion behind it." Itsuki made it sound
        <p></p>so simple.
        <p></p>"If it was that easy," Amane grumbled, "I wouldn't have any problem." He pressed a
        <p></p>hand to his forehead.
        <p></p>It seemed he would be plagued with doubt over his decision until White Day.
        <p></p>When the fateful day arrived, Amane was waiting for Mahiru in his apartment, wearing
        <p></p>an unusually nervous expression. The mood at school had reminded him of Valentine's
        <p></p>Day. The boys who had come out on top a month earlier were anxious about giving
        <p></p>their return gifts, and the girls were waiting with barely contained anticipation.
        <p></p>Incidentally, Yuuta had faithfully returned each and every gift, repaying each one with
        <p></p>an identical box of sweets. Amane's eyes glazed over when he considered that even
        <p></p>doing the very minimum must have cost Yuuta tens of thousands of yen.
        <p></p>In any case, there was no way that Amane would have given Mahiru his present at
        <p></p>school, so now he waited for her to arrive at his apartment.
        <p></p>He had rushed home from school to compose himself, but try as he might, he was just
        <p></p>not used to giving gifts. His nerves were threatening to get the better of him.
        <p></p>Just this once, he wasn't wearing his usual sweatpants and T-shirt, but rather a layered
        <p></p>outfit with a gray V-neck sweater over a white shirt, paired with chino pants. He'd
        <p></p>tried to look a little less sloppy than usual, but he wasn't entirely sure how his new
        <p></p>look would be received.
        <p></p>Amane was still struggling to get ahold of himself when he heard the sound of the front
        <p></p>door unlocking. He sat bolt upright, startled.
        <p></p>It was Mahiru, using her duplicate key, as usual. When she came into the living room,
        <p></p>she looked at Amane and froze.
        <p></p>"Ah, wh-why is your hair like that?"
        <p></p>"Well, uh, it is White Day, ya know, and I wanted to dress up a little, so I thought I had
        <p></p>better try to clean up my act today… If you don't like it, I can go fix it, though."
        <p></p>He'd obviously succeeded in surprising Mahiru, and she didn't seem to be taking it too
        <p></p>well—but when he stood up, she waved a hand in front of her face.
        <p></p>"Th-that's not what I meant. I was just surprised, is all."
        <p></p>"I see."
        <p></p>Amane could tell that something was up with Mahiru. He was starting to think he
        <p></p>should have stuck to his usual getup.
        <p></p>Mahiru was fidgeting as she took a seat beside him.
        <p></p>"…You still look uncomfortable. Should I go change?"
        <p></p>"N-no, it's fine, it's just… It's a lot."
        <p></p>"What do you mean?"
        <p></p>"W-well, you're always so low-key. I feel like I can relax around you. But… when you're
        <p></p>all done up like that, it makes it hard to stay calm."
        <p></p>"In that case, I'll take it off."
        <p></p>Mahiru grasped his sleeve tightly. "…I said it's fine."
        <p></p>When she looked up at him with dewy eyes and flushed cheeks, Amane felt his heart
        <p></p>leap in his chest. He knew she wasn't doing it on purpose, but she was really making
        <p></p>it hard for him to maintain his composure. It didn't help that she was close enough
        <p></p>that he could smell her sweet perfume.
        <p></p>Amane was incredibly aware of the way she was fidgeting restlessly and how tightly
        <p></p>she was holding on to him. Now both of them were blushing, and it made the situation
        <p></p>even more uncomfortable.
        <p></p>Amane's eyes darted restlessly around the room. "Well, uh, okay," he stammered. Then,
        <p></p>in an effort to move past the awkward moment, he gracelessly thrust a paper bag
        <p></p>toward Mahiru. "Here. It's your gift. Don't expect too much."
        <p></p>"…Thank you. May I open it?"
        <p></p>"Okay."
        <p></p>It would be embarrassing for her to open it right in front of him, but he wasn't going
        <p></p>to say no. Amane had purchased a small box lined with velvet to hold the bracelet, but
        <p></p>now he worried that it was too much for the gift he'd chosen.
        <p></p>Mahiru's slender white fingers gently opened the dark-blue box. Inside was the rose
        <p></p>gold bracelet he had purchased the other day, as well as some folded paper he had
        <p></p>included as a bonus.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem to be into gaudy accessories, so he had emphasized elegance and
        <p></p>simplicity when choosing the flower bracelet.
        <p></p>Here and there it was decorated with sparkling glass crystals that caught the light and
        <p></p>glittered. The design was both cute and refined.
        <p></p>Mahiru's caramel-colored eyes gazed for a long time at the brilliance of the rose-gold
        <p></p>bracelet in the box.
        <p></p>"You don't like it…?"
        <p></p>"No, I think it's lovely."
        <p></p>"That's a relief. I picked that because I thought it would look good on you."
        <p></p>"…Thank you very much."
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes were downcast, as though she was embarrassed by what he had said.
        <p></p>Watching her, Amane felt his breath catch in his throat.
        <p></p>"…And this is?" Mahiru asked, noticing the paper he had included in the box.
        <p></p>Amane wanted to look away, but he couldn't take his eyes off Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Ah, that?" Amane scratched his cheek in embarrassment. "Well, um, I kinda thought
        <p></p>the bracelet wasn't enough somehow, so… You're always taking care of me, and um, I
        <p></p>want to be able to grant any requests you might have, so…"
        <p></p>The paper he had put in the box as a bonus gift was a booklet of I'll do anything you
        <p></p>say tickets, like the kind a small child might make. The bunch of tickets was good for
        <p></p>three uses and featured a hand-drawn illustration of a bear. Amane thought it had
        <p></p>turned out rather well, given his skills anyway.
        <p></p>Since Mahiru was always looking after him, he wanted to do what he could to help her
        <p></p>out whenever she might need it.
        <p></p>That was the idea behind the coupons anyway, but Mahiru seemed more focused on
        <p></p>the illustrated bear. Her shoulders trembled with laughter.
        <p></p>"Pfft-ha-ha, did you draw this yourself, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Oh hush," Amane said sullenly. "I'm no artist. So what?"
        <p></p>"No, I think it's great. You chose it for a reason." Mahiru's innocent smile made it
        <p></p>obvious that she hadn't really meant to criticize. "…So can I use them right away?"
        <p></p>"On what?"
        <p></p>Amane hadn't expected her to want to exercise her privilege so suddenly, but if Mahiru
        <p></p>had a favor that she wanted to ask of him, he intended to grant her request to the very
        <p></p>best of his ability.
        <p></p>Mahiru gently turned the box containing the bracelet around to face him. "…Amane,
        <p></p>please help me put this on."
        <p></p>"Oh, come on, you don't need a ticket to ask me that," he said with a troubled smile as
        <p></p>he listened to her modest request. "Now, if the lady would allow me to assist…"
        <p></p>Mahiru held out the box, and his expression softened when he saw how cute she
        <p></p>looked. After he took the box from her, he set it down on his knees and removed the
        <p></p>bracelet, noting the smooth sound of the delicate chain sliding across the velvet.
        <p></p>Gingerly, he opened the clasp and gently wound the chain around her wrist. Finally, he
        <p></p>carefully fastened it back together. The warm rose gold sparkled on Mahiru's delicate
        <p></p>wrist.
        <p></p>I was right, this color does suit Mahiru's light skin.
        <p></p>Since hers was a refined sort of beauty, Amane had guessed that something
        <p></p>conservative and elegant would suit her better than something flashy, and he felt a
        <p></p>surge of pride when he realized that he had made the correct selection.
        <p></p>"Yeah, that looks good."
        <p></p>"…Thank you."
        <p></p>Thinking it wouldn't do to hold on to her for too long, he let go of her hand, and Mahiru
        <p></p>brought the arm bearing the bracelet up to her chest, holding it gently, and smiled
        <p></p>softly.
        <p></p>That sweet, unabashed smile, the soft shape of Mahiru's lips, the slight flush on her
        <p></p>innocent cheeks… It was both childish and womanly, guileless and refined. Amane
        <p></p>found he couldn't turn away from her, no matter how hard he tried.
        <p></p>…This is too much…
        <p></p>Knowing that he was the reason for Mahiru's smile was almost more than he could
        <p></p>stand. Amane tried to tear his eyes away and bring his soaring heart back down to
        <p></p>earth, but in the end, he kept staring at her until she noticed and hid her face in a
        <p></p>cushion.
        <p></p>"So how was White Day?"
        <p></p>The following day Itsuki asked him for a report. Amane did his best to give him a
        <p></p>humorless scowl.
        <p></p>Itsuki had been considerate enough not to ask while they were in school, but on the
        <p></p>way home, they stopped at a fast-food joint, and the moment they sat down, he began
        <p></p>digging for details with a grin.
        <p></p>Amane had only come to eat some fries because he was craving something salty.
        <p></p>Now he thought it probably would have been better not to come if he was going to
        <p></p>have to put up with this kind of questioning.
        <p></p>"What's there to tell…? I just gave her the bracelet like normal."
        <p></p>"And was she happy to get it?"
        <p></p>"…More or less," Amane answered in the calmest voice he could muster.
        <p></p>True, he hadn't gotten quite the reaction he'd been expecting, but judging by her
        <p></p>earnest smile, he was sure she'd been happy with the gift.
        <p></p>Amane felt a little uncomfortable just recalling that sweet, beautiful smile. He tried to
        <p></p>suppress the warmth creeping onto his face.
        <p></p>"Sure, sure." Itsuki folded his arms and nodded knowingly. "I can tell from your reaction
        <p></p>that it went over really well. She was definitely happy to get the gift, and she smiled at
        <p></p>you really cute-like, right?"
        <p></p>"I mean—" Amane bit his lip.
        <p></p>"Look, man. You're building a solid connection, right?"
        <p></p>Rather than teasing him, Itsuki was speaking earnestly and in a serious tone. Itsuki
        <p></p>never intruded in certain areas that, as Amane's best friend, he knew better than to
        <p></p>touch. But aside from those topics, he had an uncanny knack for pointing out the truth,
        <p></p>so much that it was sometimes uncomfortable. Amane had no recourse—Itsuki's
        <p></p>relationship was too well established to make good conversation material at this
        <p></p>point, so changing the subject was near impossible.
        <p></p>Amane choked on his words, and Itsuki smiled at him calmly. The somewhat warm
        <p></p>look in his eyes irritated Amane.
        <p></p>Seeing there was no use fighting back, Amane snatched a french fry and stubbornly
        <p></p>looked away.
        <p></p>Itsuki smiled teasingly at his friend. "I'm happy for you, man. Finally, my little Amane
        <p></p>is starting the springtime of his youth!"
        <p></p>"That's not what's happening."
        <p></p>"But you don't know for sure how she feels about it, right?"
        <p></p>"…Even so, I'm sure it's not like that."
        <p></p>Certainly, he knew from firsthand experience that Mahiru trusted him deeply. He
        <p></p>wanted to be the person she trusted the most, in fact, and out of everyone she knew
        <p></p>in school, he believed that she was the most honest with him.
        <p></p>But that didn't mean they were in love or anything.
        <p></p>Sure, sometimes when they touched, it felt a little… intense. But that wasn't uncommon
        <p></p>with opposite-sex friendships. And okay, Mahiru did do a lot for him, but he was sure
        <p></p>that didn't mean she had romantic feelings for him.
        <p></p>And yes, recently Amane had been spending a little more effort on his appearance. But
        <p></p>he was still the same hopeless loser he'd always been. There was no way that a girl
        <p></p>like Mahiru would fall for a guy like him.
        <p></p>"You know, Amane, you can be pretty pathetic sometimes. Seriously, you're the kind of
        <p></p>guy who acts like nobody will ever love him."
        <p></p>"You really think that all it takes for a guy like me to get an amazing girlfriend is a little
        <p></p>hard work? I'd have better luck waiting on a miracle…"
        <p></p>"If all the beautiful girls were snapped up by only the most handsome, charming young
        <p></p>men of the world, the guys who missed out might go down a violent path, you know."
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure Itsuki had a right to comment, as a member of the former group.
        <p></p>Itsuki continued, "Anyway, if you insist, we'll leave it at that for now… More importantly,
        <p></p>it's time for me to make a prediction as your best friend."
        <p></p>"About what?"
        <p></p>"Sooner or later, you're gonna change. I can already see the telltale signs. All that's left
        <p></p>is for you to take the first steps toward your new future."
        <p></p>"…Don't talk like some kind of know-it-all guru," Amane said with a scowl.
        <p></p>"Ha-ha-ha! How long have we been friends?"
        <p></p>"It hasn't even been a year," Amane quipped coolly.
        <p></p>"Oh yeah, that's right!" Itsuki roared with laughter.
        <p></p>The two of them had only known each other since the start of high school, but Itsuki
        <p></p>understood Amane much better than the guys he'd known in elementary and middle
        <p></p>school back home. He was glad that the two of them got along so easily.
        <p></p>"Anyway—," Itsuki continued.
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"You keep going on and on about how you're not worthy of her, but your attitude and
        <p></p>the way you talk about her just proves that you actually do like her."
        <p></p>"I will stick this french fry right up your nose," Amane threatened.
        <p></p>"Sorry," Itsuki instantly apologized.
        <p></p>Amane came very close to actually being impressed by what his friend had to say only
        <p></p>for Itsuki to ruin it right at the end with a ridiculous comment.
        <p></p>"You're late today."
        <p></p>When Amane returned home about an hour later than usual, Mahiru came out to greet
        <p></p>him in her apron. After his earlier conversation with Itsuki, Amane couldn't help but
        <p></p>think that she looked like a newlywed. He told himself that he didn't feel that way
        <p></p>about her, so it wasn't fair to indulge in that delusion, and he drove the thought from
        <p></p>his mind in a bit of a panic.
        <p></p>"Mm, I had fries with Itsuki."
        <p></p>"…Right before dinner?"
        <p></p>"Don't worry, I'll finish my plate."
        <p></p>He had a second stomach for Mahiru's cooking, and he had been conservative and only
        <p></p>had a small order of fries anyway, so he had plenty of room for his meal, even if Mahiru
        <p></p>dished up his usual serving size.
        <p></p>"For a second, I worried about you gaining weight…," Mahiru mused. "But you're so
        <p></p>slim that you could probably stand to put on a little bit more meat."
        <p></p>"You're one to talk. I'm always worried you might snap in half one day."
        <p></p>"I'm not that fragile, you know."
        <p></p>"Oh really? Look at how thin you are."
        <p></p>Mahiru had a very slender and feminine physique. Of course, she did quite a few
        <p></p>sports, so she wasn't just thin, she was also toned and flexible. Still, she had a delicate
        <p></p>look to her for some reason, and just as a test, he reached out and grabbed her wrist,
        <p></p>easily wrapping his fingers all the way around. He remembered his father warning
        <p></p>him to always treat a lady gently and with care.
        <p></p>She seemed so dainty and thin, he thought, as he moved his fingers along hers, feeling
        <p></p>the delicate bones beneath her skin.
        <p></p>Mahiru squirmed uncomfortably. He saw she was staring at her hand in his, her cheeks
        <p></p>slightly flushed, and realized much too late that he had been touching her without her
        <p></p>permission.
        <p></p>In a panic, Amane released Mahiru's hand.
        <p></p>"Sorry. I should've known you wouldn't like that."
        <p></p>"It's… Well… I don't hate it when you touch me."
        <p></p>Amane stared at Mahiru in shock. He could barely believe his own ears. Mahiru also
        <p></p>seemed to realize what exactly she had said and looked up suddenly, cheeks redder than
        <p></p>he had ever seen them, eyes beginning to fill with tears. Amane felt like he couldn't
        <p></p>possibly bear the embarrassment a moment longer.
        <p></p>"Th-that doesn't mean that I'm asking you to touch me or anything, all right?" Mahiru
        <p></p>explained. "Just that I hate it when other guys touch me. You understand?"
        <p></p>"Y-yeah," Amane said meekly.
        <p></p>However, his heart was still pounding wildly. The very particular phrasing she had
        <p></p>used left an awful lot open to interpretation. He felt like he needed to change the subject.
        <p></p>"…Oh, um, I noticed…," he mumbled, "you're not wearing the bracelet I gave you
        <p></p>yesterday. I mean, obviously you don't have to wear it if you don't want…"
        <p></p>Mahiru looked down at her wrist and with one finger softly traced the place where
        <p></p>Amane had grasped her.
        <p></p>"…If I wear it when I'm doing housework, it gets in the way, and it'll get damaged
        <p></p>sooner… I want to keep it nice, so I'll wear it on my days off."
        <p></p>"…I see."
        <p></p>Amane could not imagine a more perfect answer. She had told him both that she was
        <p></p>going to treasure the gift and that she was intending to wear it regularly. His legs
        <p></p>threatened to give out on the spot, and his chest felt like it might burst with all the
        <p></p>feelings bubbling up inside him, and in the heat of the moment, he was sure there
        <p></p>wasn't a man alive who would have felt any different.
        <p></p>Somewhere in this dizzy state of mind, Amane realized how loudly his heart was
        <p></p>thumping. He took several long, slow breaths to try to calm down.
        <p></p>"…As long as you like it, I'm happy."
        <p></p>"I do, and I'm going to take good care of it. Like I do with all of them—the teddy bear,
        <p></p>the key holder, and the bracelet. I'm going to use the hand cream without reservation,
        <p></p>though." Mahiru smiled slightly, looking embarrassed.
        <p></p>Amane could not take it a moment longer. He quickly kicked off his shoes and darted
        <p></p>down the hallway.
        <p></p>"…I'm going to change clothes."
        <p></p>"O-okay. See you when you get back, Amane."
        <p></p>Even though he had come home to his own single apartment, Amane felt like he was
        <p></p>being sent off by his new wife. His heart began to pound violently again, and he rushed
        <p></p>into his bedroom and promptly collapsed on the floor.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 23: The Start of Spring Vacation 
        <p></p>This is worse than I expected…
        <p></p>Amane stifled a yawn as he watched the distant figure of the school principal up on
        <p></p>the stage, giving a stern address. He didn't really care about closing ceremonies or
        <p></p>whatever speech the principal had prepared for the occasion. Frankly, he would have
        <p></p>rather been napping.
        <p></p>Most of the students around him seemed to share that sentiment. Very few people
        <p></p>were actually paying much attention. Everybody else was obviously zoning out.
        <p></p>Still, it wasn't like the students could flaunt their boredom, so Amane put on a serious
        <p></p>expression and silently wished for a speedy end to the proceedings as he let the
        <p></p>principal's speech flow in one ear and out the other, the minutes slipping past as he
        <p></p>pretended to be a model student.
        <p></p>He might have cared about graduation, but this was just the closing ceremony. It didn't
        <p></p>really matter.
        <p></p>"…Ah, I'm so stiff."
        <p></p>"The principal's speeches are always so long."
        <p></p>That was the general sentiment as the students returned to their classrooms.
        <p></p>Nevertheless, everyone sounded quite lively, probably because two weeks of freedom
        <p></p>awaited them after this final homeroom period.
        <p></p>From his seat, Amane watched his cheerful schoolmates who would soon be liberated
        <p></p>from their boring classes, and he let out a quiet sigh.
        <p></p>Spring vacation started tomorrow, but how would he spend it?
        <p></p>He had pretty much just seen his parents, so considering how much it cost to travel,
        <p></p>he figured he could take a pass on going home. But that left him with an empty schedule.
        <p></p>Even if he thoroughly prepared for next year's classes, he would have a lot of time on
        <p></p>his hands. He had considered getting a short-term job, but he hadn't managed to line
        <p></p>up anything, and now there wasn't enough time. The only friends he had to hang out
        <p></p>with over the break were Itsuki and Chitose.
        <p></p>"Hey, hey, Amaneee—"
        <p></p>Itsuki appeared just as he crossed Amane's mind.
        <p></p>When he turned around, he saw Itsuki wearing an enthusiastic smile… and was
        <p></p>immediately suspicious. Itsuki only smiled like that when he had a favor to ask, or
        <p></p>when he was about to suggest something foolish.
        <p></p>"What is it?"
        <p></p>"Are you free starting tomorrow?"
        <p></p>"I guess I am."
        <p></p>"Right, right, I thought so. That's good, veeery good."
        <p></p>Still grinning, Itsuki patted the bag that was hanging from the side of his desk. Even
        <p></p>though everyone was supposed to have cleared out their lockers and desks the day
        <p></p>before, Itsuki's bag was obviously packed full. They didn't even have any classes that
        <p></p>day, so the most he could have possibly needed to bring to school would be a pen and
        <p></p>maybe a binder, but Itsuki's bag looked like it was about to burst.
        <p></p>"…What's all that?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Change of clothes."
        <p></p>"Why?"
        <p></p>"'Cause I'm staying at your place…"
        <p></p>Itsuki put on his humblest, most flattering voice and gave Amane an imploring look.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help but scowl back at his friend.
        <p></p>"Hang on a sec; haven't you ever heard of giving advance notice?"
        <p></p>"Sure I have. Consider yourself notified that I'm coming over, staying several nights,
        <p></p>and bringing the party with me!"
        <p></p>"What, you're gonna keep the whole neighborhood up all night? How well do you think
        <p></p>that's gonna go over, idiot?"
        <p></p>"Geez, dude, I was only joking… But I am serious about you letting me stay with you."
        <p></p>Itsuki rarely failed to let Amane know ahead of time when he was coming over. The
        <p></p>first thing that came to mind was that it was an emergency. Amane struggled to imagine
        <p></p>what it could be about, though.
        <p></p>"I had a fight with my dad this morning."
        <p></p>As if to answer Amane's internal question, Itsuki readily disclosed the reason.
        <p></p>"…About Chitose?"
        <p></p>"Yeah. When my dad gets mad, he won't listen to me unless I leave him alone for a few
        <p></p>days. And I've been staying at Chi's house a lot, so I'd rather not go there. No matter
        <p></p>how accepting her parents are, it doesn't seem right, ya know?"
        <p></p>"But you're okay staying with me?"
        <p></p>"I thought you might let me."
        <p></p>Itsuki probably assumed it would be no big deal. He'd stayed over at Amane's
        <p></p>apartment plenty of times, even before Amane had cleaned up the place.
        <p></p>And it wasn't like Amane didn't want to let his friend stay with him. But there was the
        <p></p>issue of Mahiru. Amane was worried that he would be forcing her to stay in her public
        <p></p>persona during a time when she wanted to relax, since he didn't think she would feel
        <p></p>comfortable acting casually with Itsuki around.
        <p></p>And there was another issue. Recently, he had noticed that Mahiru had been acting
        <p></p>strangely affectionate, and he was afraid that if Itsuki saw her treating a guy that way,
        <p></p>he would immediately get the wrong idea.
        <p></p>"…Let me ask."
        <p></p>Amane sent Mahiru a text message asking her what she thought. She would probably
        <p></p>send him a memo about the shopping before going home, so he expected she would
        <p></p>see it when she did that. It only took a moment for him to send the message, but Itsuki
        <p></p>let out a long, drawn-out sigh.
        <p></p>"What—are you two living together or something?"
        <p></p>"I'll leave you on the floor with no heater or futon."
        <p></p>"Just when I start to think you're a nice guy for letting me stay over, you go and
        <p></p>threaten to stand by and do nothing while I freeze to death?"
        <p></p>"Hey, you got yourself into this."
        <p></p>Amane shot a look at Itsuki that essentially said What are you even going on about, and
        <p></p>Itsuki could only shrug in response.
        <p></p>I'm the one who should be shrugging. I don't want you to cause Mahiru any trouble with
        <p></p>your usual antics.
        <p></p>Itsuki was pretty good at reading the room, so Amane didn't think he would knowingly
        <p></p>bother Mahiru or anything, but he wasn't looking forward to all the teasing he would
        <p></p>have to endure the moment she wasn't around. Amane let out a sigh as Itsuki grinned
        <p></p>at him.
        <p></p>Apparently, Mahiru sometimes checked her phone at school, because Amane had
        <p></p>already gotten a response: "I'll make dinner as usual if you buy enough food for three."
        <p></p>"She said it's all right."
        <p></p>"Yay, I get to eat Mahiru's cooking!"
        <p></p>"That wasn't your goal all along, was it?"
        <p></p>"Let's just say I'm not one to waste an opportunity. Besides, you're always raving about
        <p></p>her cooking. I want to try it at least once."
        <p></p>"…Don't you dare be a nuisance to her."
        <p></p>"I may be a nuisance to you, but never to her."
        <p></p>"Don't annoy me, either."
        <p></p>Itsuki cackled, and Amane flicked him in the forehead. Though his friend yelped in
        <p></p>pain, he still wore a giddy smile, and Amane let out another overdrawn sigh.
        <p></p>"So how long are you planning on staying?"
        <p></p>Amane was looking at Itsuki, who had made himself comfortable the instant they'd
        <p></p>gotten the shopping through the door. Itsuki hadn't been coming over much lately
        <p></p>because Mahiru was always around, but before that, he'd visited Amane's apartment
        <p></p>often, and he obviously still felt right at home.
        <p></p>Itsuki crossed his legs and took a sip from his cup of coffee, staring off in thought. He
        <p></p>looked like a model in a photo shoot. "Hmm… Well, for now, why don't we say… three
        <p></p>days, give or take. Geez, this is a real pain!"
        <p></p>"Your dad's not a bad person, but he does seem to be pretty stuck in his ways."
        <p></p>"The old geezer's a stubborn ass."
        <p></p>"Come on—"
        <p></p>"I mean, what gives him the right to tell me who I can and can't date?! Whatever; I'm
        <p></p>moving out once I'm an adult anyway." Itsuki stuck out his tongue in a show of anger.
        <p></p>Amane knew that Itsuki didn't actually hate his father. His old man was the kind of guy
        <p></p>who had to have everything his way, sure, but once somebody won his affection, he
        <p></p>always treated them well. Amane thought he was a good person at least.
        <p></p>But Chitose had never obtained his approval. Amane thought that it probably had to
        <p></p>do with the fact that Itsuki's family was fairly well-to-do. Itsuki's father probably
        <p></p>wanted his son to date someone from the same social class. At the same time, Amane
        <p></p>wondered if maybe Itsuki's father just couldn't stand Chitose's unique personality.
        <p></p>Either way, it sounded like he had dismissed Itsuki's relationship without listening to
        <p></p>anything Itsuki had to say. So Itsuki had declared that, if that was the case, he was
        <p></p>leaving home.
        <p></p>"You've got it good when it comes to parents, Amane. They let you do whatever you
        <p></p>want."
        <p></p>"My parents are super close, so I guess they want their son to choose a partner he
        <p></p>likes."
        <p></p>"I am seriously jealous of your parents."
        <p></p>Itsuki's upbringing had been really strict, so perhaps it was only natural for him to be
        <p></p>going through a rebellious phase. Bleaching his hair and acting like nothing ever
        <p></p>bothered him were just other parts of his insurrection. Amane didn't think he was
        <p></p>really in a position to criticize.
        <p></p>"You say that, but I'm sure your parents can't be that bad."
        <p></p>"They might be decent people, but they're awful parents. I mean, you can't just try to
        <p></p>control your kids all the time, man. You gotta let 'em run free sometimes, 'cause if you
        <p></p>always try to keep 'em on a leash, they're gonna bite you one day."
        <p></p>"And you think you'd be okay, running wild all the time?"
        <p></p>"Maybe, if they'd let me do my own thing. But instead they slapped a collar on me and
        <p></p>put me in a cage, so all I can do is bare my fangs." Itsuki shrugged. "They've been alive
        <p></p>for how long? You'd think they would have learned better by now." He slurped down
        <p></p>the rest of his coffee in one go.
        <p></p>"Well, you can relax for a few days. I mean, we're on break, so we've got nothing but
        <p></p>time."
        <p></p>"Friends truly are life's greatest treasure…!"
        <p></p>"Don't cling to me like that; it's creepy."
        <p></p>"You wound me! I demand Lady Shiina's cooking as consolation!"
        <p></p>"As if you need an excuse to eat dinner…"
        <p></p>"Tee-hee!"
        <p></p>"Don't act like such a weirdo."
        <p></p>"How cruel, to wound me yet again! Oh, boo-hoo!"
        <p></p>Itsuki pantomimed wiping away tears, but his grin was wider than ever. Amane
        <p></p>watched him with exasperation but also a small sense of relief.
        <p></p>Itsuki had frequent battles with his father, but the fight this morning seemed to have
        <p></p>gotten to him more than usual. It was obvious that he'd been putting on a brave face
        <p></p>at school.
        <p></p>Amane was glad to see that his friend was feeling at least a bit better. Of course, he
        <p></p>didn't want to let on to Itsuki that he was worried about him, so he pretended to be
        <p></p>sour even as he secretly breathed a sigh of relief.
        <p></p>Mahiru came over to Amane's apartment sometime after sundown.
        <p></p>She arrived empty-handed, presumably because Amane had already acquired all the
        <p></p>ingredients she had requested.
        <p></p>Amane had given her advance warning that his friend would be there, so she didn't
        <p></p>seem put off by the sight of Itsuki making himself at home. In fact, Itsuki was the one
        <p></p>who seemed slightly flustered.
        <p></p>"It's been a while, Akazawa."
        <p></p>"Nice to see you after so long. Sorry to suddenly barge into your love nest… Ow, owww!
        <p></p>I get it; it was only a joke! Sorry to suddenly intrude; it must be awkward for you to
        <p></p>have some unfamiliar guy hanging around."
        <p></p>Amane had wordlessly stomped on Itsuki's foot, but even as he groaned in pain, he
        <p></p>wore an amiable grin.
        <p></p>"No, not at all," Mahiru replied. "It's fun to have such… lively people over."
        <p></p>"Well, don't expect any peace or quiet with this guy around," Amane added.
        <p></p>"You shouldn't say things like that," Mahiru scolded.
        <p></p>Amane held his tongue, but Itsuki was giving him a smug look, so he pinched him on
        <p></p>the side where Mahiru couldn't see. Unfortunately, Itsuki was in very good shape, so
        <p></p>there weren't many places where he could find purchase with his fingers.
        <p></p>"Well then, I'm going to go make dinner, so please relax."
        <p></p>Mahiru ignored the boys' squabbling, flashed her angelic smile, put on her apron, and
        <p></p>departed for the kitchen. She was obviously comfortable leaving their guest in Amane's
        <p></p>hands.
        <p></p>Itsuki stared at Mahiru's back as she went, still smiling smugly. "…You're close enough
        <p></p>to give her a key to your place, huh?"
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>Mahiru had let herself in with her key, rather than buzzing over the intercom. Itsuki
        <p></p>had not failed to pick up on this sign of intimacy.
        <p></p>"And she told me 'Please relax' like she runs the place. Honestly, she's acting like she's
        <p></p>already your wife!"
        <p></p>"Do you want me to kick you out?"
        <p></p>"Okay, okay, I'm only kidding… is what I'd normally say, but you gotta understand how
        <p></p>this looks, my man!"
        <p></p>Amane tried to grab him by the scruff of the neck, but Itsuki twisted away. He scuttled
        <p></p>across the carpet and booted up Amane's video game console. Amane slid off the
        <p></p>couch and sat down next to him, making sure to give him a gentle knee in the back on
        <p></p>the way, and the two of them killed some time playing games.
        <p></p>Before too long, Amane started to hear the sound of Mahiru taking the dishes out. He
        <p></p>wasn't going to make her do everything, so he stood up and headed for the kitchen.
        <p></p>"Let me help. Can I take the dishes that are already plated?"
        <p></p>"Yes, thank you."
        <p></p>Amane took several plates piled with food out to the table. When he set them down,
        <p></p>he caught Itsuki staring at him, looking dumbfounded.
        <p></p>"…How should I put this…?"
        <p></p>"What's up?"
        <p></p>"Know what? I'll keep it to myself."
        <p></p>"What the heck…," Amane muttered as Itsuki started packing away the game console.
        <p></p>When it was time for dinner, the three of them sat down, with Mahiru's homemade
        <p></p>dishes between them, and Itsuki wore a truly pleased expression.
        <p></p>"So good…"
        <p></p>"Thank you very much."
        <p></p>Mahiru sat up straight and proper as she ate. She wore her calm, angelic smile, but
        <p></p>since Itsuki already knew their secret, Amane could tell that she was letting herself
        <p></p>relax a little.
        <p></p>Itsuki looked like he was in a trance, bringing bites of food to his mouth.
        <p></p>Amane had warned Mahiru ahead of time that Itsuki would eat more than he would,
        <p></p>so she had prepared large portions for him, but even so, he was putting it away pretty
        <p></p>quickly.
        <p></p>"Wow, you're a lucky man, Amane, to be able to eat food like this every day…"
        <p></p>"I'm all too aware of that. The food is delicious as always, by the way."
        <p></p>"…Thank you very much."
        <p></p>He gave Mahiru his reaction after sipping his miso soup.
        <p></p>Amane's lips curled into a smile as he savored the taste. He couldn't help but grin at
        <p></p>the comforting combination of dashi and miso. It was so good that he never got tired
        <p></p>of it, even having it every day. But the person who cooked it didn't seem to realize just
        <p></p>how sublime it was, so he always made sure to tell her.
        <p></p>The soup had a gentle flavor that reminded Amane of her personality. It warmed him
        <p></p>all the way down into his belly. He didn't find it at all surprising that Itsuki was
        <p></p>entranced.
        <p></p>"Ah, it's so good."
        <p></p>Today Mahiru had made Amane's favorite dish, rolled omelets, so he had an even
        <p></p>bigger appetite than usual. Of course Mahiru's food was so good that Amane always
        <p></p>went back for seconds, but even so, his appetite was an entirely different beast when
        <p></p>eggs were on the menu.
        <p></p>As he was smacking his lips at the rich, comforting dishes, Itsuki kept glancing over at
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru. "…What a happy couple," he muttered.
        <p></p>"Did you say something?"
        <p></p>"Nope!" Itsuki shook his head. "Not a thing!" He returned his attention to his plate.
        <p></p>Amane decided not to question him any further. He noticed that Mahiru was staring
        <p></p>at him quietly and simply shrugged.
        <p></p>After dinner, Mahiru went home early.
        <p></p>Usually, she would stay at Amane's place until it was time to wind down, typically a bit
        <p></p>after nine o'clock, but because Itsuki was staying over, she had decided it was best to
        <p></p>leave a little sooner. The two of them had been left alone while Amane had done the
        <p></p>washing up, and he wondered if that awkwardness wasn't part of the reason she'd left
        <p></p>so soon.
        <p></p>When Amane asked Itsuki what they had talked about, he'd said that they'd just made
        <p></p>small talk and chatted about Chitose. Amane hadn't questioned his friend any further,
        <p></p>but he had a suspicion that other topics had come up.
        <p></p>"Hey, Amane?"
        <p></p>Just before going to sleep, Itsuki looked up from where he had spread out a futon on
        <p></p>the floor of the bedroom.
        <p></p>"What is it?" Amane asked from his bed.
        <p></p>"The way you look at Shiina, with those big soft eyes… You definitely have a thing for
        <p></p>her, right?"
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>"Anybody can see it, man. You're absolutely lovestruck."
        <p></p>"Don't make me kick you out into the cold."
        <p></p>"Aw, c'mon."
        <p></p>Amane shot his friend a glare that dared him to keep going, but Itsuki did not look the
        <p></p>least bit discouraged. On the other hand, he wasn't wearing his usual cheeky grin,
        <p></p>either. Itsuki's expression looked genuinely happy—and even a little proud.
        <p></p>"Well, fine, I'm not expecting you to admit it. But I want you to know that I'm happy
        <p></p>for you, man. I'm happy that you found somebody who can appreciate you."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"Geez, you really are dense. Look, most of the folks in our class probably think you're
        <p></p>a weird, gloomy loner."
        <p></p>"I'm perfectly aware of that, thank you very much."
        <p></p>Among his classmates, Amane had always been something of a plain, unsociable
        <p></p>character, the kind of boy who never really stood out or got noticed, despite his high
        <p></p>ranking on almost every exam.
        <p></p>Compared to guys like Itsuki, the sophisticated and cheerful gentleman, or Yuuta, the
        <p></p>fresh-faced prince, Amane might as well have been invisible. Not to mention that,
        <p></p>whether he knew it or not, Amane was always doing his hardest to not stand out or
        <p></p>make waves. Of course he wasn't popular.
        <p></p>"But they're only going by what they can see," Itsuki continued. "They don't know the
        <p></p>real you. And even the people who do get to know you have to look hard to see your
        <p></p>good parts."
        <p></p>Itsuki was staring at Amane without a hint of mockery in his eyes. His sudden
        <p></p>earnestness made Amane a little uncomfortable.
        <p></p>"It's such a waste that you don't know just what an awesome guy you are. That's why
        <p></p>I'm so happy that Shiina sees you for who you really are and gets along with you so
        <p></p>well."
        <p></p>"Itsuki…"
        <p></p>"So hurry up and start dating her, and let's go on a double date!"
        <p></p>"Geez, why does it always come back around to that?"
        <p></p>While he obviously couldn't pass up the opportunity to tease his friend, Amane
        <p></p>noticed that Itsuki wasn't looking directly at him. He was probably trying to hide his
        <p></p>embarrassment after getting all emotional. Amane figured Itsuki could stand to be offbalance for a change.
        <p></p>"Chi would be happy, too, ya know," Itsuki added.
        <p></p>"By all means, you two go have the time of your lives. Just leave us out of it. I mean,
        <p></p>if—and this is entirely hypothetical—but if we did develop that sort of relationship,
        <p></p>would you really want to be seen with a guy who looks like I do?"
        <p></p>"No, we'd obviously get you to transform into the mystery man. Speaking of which,
        <p></p>you still haven't let me see it."
        <p></p>"Nope."
        <p></p>"Is it one of those things you only let Shiina see?"
        <p></p>"Itsuki, you have a choice. Either you can shut up and enjoy my hospitality or freeze to
        <p></p>death beneath the cold winter sky."
        <p></p>"Well, excuuuse me!"
        <p></p>Itsuki knelt on top of his futon and bowed in mock apology.
        <p></p>"Good grief," Amane muttered in an exasperated tone.
        <p></p>Itsuki must have still been scheming up ways to get his buddy a girlfriend to spice up
        <p></p>his life.
        <p></p>But there's no way I have any chance of dating Mahiru… right?
        <p></p>She already did so much for him. If the two of them really did start dating, he would
        <p></p>probably come to rely on her for absolutely everything. Forget how spoiled he was
        <p></p>now, dating Mahiru was a sure path to utter dependency.
        <p></p>And anyway, Mahiru didn't seem interested in guys.
        <p></p>She didn't have much of a problem being around Amane or Itsuki or even Amane's
        <p></p>father, but when it came to the other boys at school, she kept them all at a comfortable
        <p></p>distance, wearing her angel mask like thick armor.
        <p></p>Male classmates were constantly approaching her to confess their love, but he'd never
        <p></p>known Mahiru to date anyone, ever. It was like she didn't want anything to do with
        <p></p>boys.
        <p></p>And since Amane still wasn't sure exactly how he felt about Mahiru, he was in no hurry
        <p></p>to embarrass himself with a halfhearted confession. Plus, he was convinced that
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't have those kinds of feelings for him anyway.
        <p></p>Dating Mahiru would remain a distant fantasy.
        <p></p>"…But look, Shiina obviously really likes you. Step back and take a good look at your
        <p></p>situation before you dismiss it all as impossible." Itsuki spoke as if he had seen straight
        <p></p>through Amane's heart.
        <p></p>Amane just mumbled "…Easy for you to say…" and crawled under his comforter.
        <p></p>"Itsuki is so sneaky! I want to eat Mahirun's cooking, tooooo!"
        <p></p>The following day, Chitose called Amane on the phone at a ridiculously early hour.
        <p></p>Evidently, Itsuki had been in touch with her the night before. He had taken photos of
        <p></p>their dinner, like he had often seen many girls going, apparently for the purpose of
        <p></p>sending it to Chitose.
        <p></p>"Don't tell me. You've gotta ask Shiina."
        <p></p>"Okay, so if I get Mahirun to say it's okay, you'll share with me?"
        <p></p>"Uh, well—"
        <p></p>"Got it!" Chitose answered energetically. "Okay, I'm gonna go ask her!"
        <p></p>Then she hung up.
        <p></p>Amane had been holding the phone away from his ear because Chitose was so loud.
        <p></p>Now he made an exasperated face. As usual, he wasn't sure whether he should be
        <p></p>impressed or terrified by Chitose's energy.
        <p></p>Itsuki, who'd been watching the whole time, looked awfully pleased.
        <p></p>"Chi sounds pretty excited."
        <p></p>"Can't you do something about your girlfriend?"
        <p></p>"Pretty much impossible, man," Itsuki replied cheerfully. "When she sees something
        <p></p>she wants, Chi doesn't hold back. That's why I love her so much."
        <p></p>Amane figured that Itsuki's opinion was a little biased, on account of being in love and
        <p></p>all. There was a lot to be said for Chitose's abundant energy and the easy way she made
        <p></p>friends with almost everyone, and Amane was ready to admit that he often envied
        <p></p>those strengths that he so clearly lacked.
        <p></p>For the time being, he decided to heat up the leftovers from yesterday's dinner and
        <p></p>have them for breakfast. Silently, he thanked Mahiru for the food and for her future
        <p></p>patience dealing with Chitose's call.
        <p></p>"And so here I am!"
        <p></p>Chitose appeared, along with Mahiru, just before lunch. The two of them were carrying
        <p></p>shopping bags overflowing with food. Chitose was also wearing a backpack that looked
        <p></p>like it might be an overnight bag, and Mahiru was smiling ruefully. They'd obviously
        <p></p>met up earlier and gone shopping together. That explained why they were both
        <p></p>carrying bags and how Chitose had reached Amane's apartment.
        <p></p>"You got here pretty quick…," Amane remarked.
        <p></p>"I got all excited about the idea of staying over at Mahirun's place!"
        <p></p>"…Wait, what?"
        <p></p>"We are on spring vacation, so I figured, why not? And Mahirun said I could, so here I
        <p></p>am!"
        <p></p>Chitose grinned widely and looked at Mahiru for confirmation, and Mahiru nodded
        <p></p>with a smile.
        <p></p>She obviously had no choice.
        <p></p>Chitose must have strong-armed Mahiru into allowing her to stay over. But Mahiru
        <p></p>didn't seem particularly upset or anything, only somewhat bewildered by the sudden
        <p></p>development.
        <p></p>As Mahiru went to put the groceries away in the refrigerator, she leaned close to
        <p></p>Amane. "Don't worry about me. I told her it was okay," she reassured him in a whisper
        <p></p>so quiet that only he could hear.
        <p></p>Amane wore a worried smile as he watched Mahiru put the dinner ingredients in the
        <p></p>fridge.
        <p></p>"I'm looking forward to Mahirun's cooking!" Chitose beamed as she sat down next to
        <p></p>Itsuki and clung tightly to his side. Amane had lost his seat for the moment, so he
        <p></p>headed into the kitchen.
        <p></p>"Is there anything I can do to help?"
        <p></p>"…Amane, you know you can't cook."
        <p></p>She kept her voice down so it didn't carry into the living room and called him by his
        <p></p>first name. Amane smiled slightly.
        <p></p>"I could cut up vegetables or something? Actually, if you give me instructions, I could
        <p></p>do something simple. I showed you that I can actually make some things, didn't I?"
        <p></p>"…All right, I'll take the help. You really don't want to stay in the other room, do you?"
        <p></p>"Very perceptive. They're already flirting."
        <p></p>Amane shrugged and moved to the sink to wash his hands.
        <p></p>He knew he couldn't do much, but it wasn't like he was completely useless. He could
        <p></p>at least help Mahiru out with things like measuring and prep work, so he turned his
        <p></p>back on the lovebirds and their flirting for a while and became Mahiru's kitchen
        <p></p>assistant.
        <p></p>"By the way, what are we having for lunch today?"
        <p></p>"Omelets over rice, with green potage soup and a salad. Chitose said that she wanted
        <p></p>to eat the type of omelet that's half cooked inside when you cut it open with a knife."
        <p></p>"Nice."
        <p></p>"You really like egg dishes, don't you?"
        <p></p>"Eggs are great. Plus, yours are the most delicious, so I'm already looking forward to
        <p></p>it."
        <p></p>Mahiru's cooking never disappointed, and Amane was even more excited to hear they
        <p></p>were having eggs, his favorite. He still thought about the beef stew omelets they had
        <p></p>eaten that one time. He would have been happy eating those every day.
        <p></p>Amane silently lauded Chitose for her excellent menu request as he cheerfully
        <p></p>measured and washed four portions of rice. Gradually, he noticed that Mahiru was still
        <p></p>standing there, next to the refrigerator.
        <p></p>"…What's up?"
        <p></p>"…I appreciate the compliment, but don't catch me off guard like that."
        <p></p>"What do you mean?"
        <p></p>"It's fine if you didn't get it."
        <p></p>Mahiru abruptly turned away and began cutting up the ingredients for the soup,
        <p></p>leaving Amane standing there looking bewildered.
        <p></p>"I can't believe they can act like that and still not be dating."
        <p></p>"Seriously."
        <p></p>"Ah, that was sooo goood!"
        <p></p>Chitose finished the last of her lunch and patted her belly in utter satisfaction.
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled, glad that her efforts were so appreciated. Apparently, she rather liked
        <p></p>entertaining. The day's sudden appearances had evidently not been too trying.
        <p></p>"Wow, you really can make anything, huh, Shiina?" Itsuki gushed. "You were able to
        <p></p>prepare half-cooked omelets that kept their shape while still being so soft in the
        <p></p>middle."
        <p></p>"It's all thanks to my cooking teacher," Mahiru replied modestly.
        <p></p>"You studied cooking?" Chitose asked.
        <p></p>"Yes, sort of. Enough to take care of myself and to entertain guests when I need to."
        <p></p>"Whoa!" Chitose marveled. "That must have been one amazing teacher if you learned
        <p></p>to cook like this!"
        <p></p>Mahiru must have been talking about the maid she had mentioned to Amane before,
        <p></p>the only person in her parents' house who had treated her with any kindness.
        <p></p>"I wonder if I could get this good, if I had a teacher like that."
        <p></p>"Maybe if you were a little less… adventurous in the kitchen, you would have better
        <p></p>results," Itsuki suggested.
        <p></p>"Hey—what's the point if you don't experiment a little?!"
        <p></p>"Well, if you tried following a recipe for once, I'm sure you could make just about
        <p></p>anything."
        <p></p>It was true; Chitose would have made a really good cook if she ever stopped messing
        <p></p>around. But her lack of discipline really undermined her efforts.
        <p></p>Chitose's personality was like a cat's—she did whatever she fancied at the moment and
        <p></p>generally pursued things at her own speed. The problem was that she had basically
        <p></p>no self-control. She could force herself to focus for a while if she had to, but it was
        <p></p>obviously exhausting for her. Chitose just wasn't wired that way.
        <p></p>"And not just in the kitchen, either," Itsuki continued. "You could try bringing a little
        <p></p>composure to your everyday life. You've got a great role model right there, see?"
        <p></p>"Oh, I'm sure you'd just love me to become more like Mahirun, but I'm afraid you're
        <p></p>out of luck. Besides, it seems… uncomfortable."
        <p></p>"That's awfully rude to Shiina."
        <p></p>"Maybe. But you have to admit, Mahirun always seems so formal. Or maybe, like,
        <p></p>stifled?" Sometimes Chitose could be surprisingly perceptive. "The Mahirun we see at
        <p></p>school is pretty dull."
        <p></p>"…Is that really how I come off to others?" Mahiru murmured.
        <p></p>"Well… we are in different classes," Chitose answered, "so I'm no authority, but you
        <p></p>seem dull or… sort of like you're looking down on everything, from a distance, you
        <p></p>know? I mean, you're still nice to everyone, but I can tell you never let your guard
        <p></p>down."
        <p></p>Chitose's conjecture was right on target.
        <p></p>Mahiru certainly treated others with kindness and respect, but she also never let
        <p></p>anyone except for a very small number of people see behind her mask. By playing the
        <p></p>part of the gracious and upstanding young woman, she kept her true identity safe and
        <p></p>hidden.
        <p></p>Nobody knew that better than Mahiru, though. Amane watched her expression grow
        <p></p>cloudy. But Chitose threw an arm around her and smiled.
        <p></p>"Mahirun makes a super-cute face whenever I bring up this kinda personal stuff, so
        <p></p>you can tell that she's being honest, right? I like this version best!"
        <p></p>Chitose giggled and squeezed Mahiru tight. Mahiru looked embarrassed for a moment,
        <p></p>but then she hesitantly returned Chitose's embrace.
        <p></p>"You know, Mahirun," Chitose continued, "I think you should open up more. I mean,
        <p></p>you could have Amane totally spoil you, you know? And we know you can be super
        <p></p>sweet to people you like. So if you'd just use that to your advantage, you'd have them
        <p></p>eating out of your palm!"
        <p></p>"I will do no such thing!" Mahiru insisted.
        <p></p>"Ehhh?"
        <p></p>"…I'm not like that at all, Chitose," Mahiru muttered, turning away sharply.
        <p></p>"Oh reaaally?" Chitose replied, staring at Amane.
        <p></p>Of course Amane was not about to get involved in this discussion. Mahiru hadn't asked
        <p></p>him for help or anything, and he knew that she could fight her own battles.
        <p></p>That said, if she ever did happen to ask, Amane was ready and willing to do just about
        <p></p>anything her heart desired. He would help her shoulder any burden and support her
        <p></p>however he could. That would be too embarrassing to admit, though, so he tried to
        <p></p>maintain a neutral expression as he watched Chitose and Mahiru's exchange.
        <p></p>"Oh man, it's a feast for the eyes to watch two beautiful girls getting along, huh?"
        <p></p>"Your words, not mine."
        <p></p>Letting Itsuki's somewhat perverted remark pass by without comment, Amane
        <p></p>realized that Mahiru had found a friend of the same gender. He was glad she had
        <p></p>someone else she could be open with.
        <p></p>Chitose's sleepover naturally took place at Mahiru's place.
        <p></p>Amane had expected her to want to stay with Itsuki, but she had said that since he was
        <p></p>always staying over at her place, she was happy being with Mahiru, and the two of
        <p></p>them headed back to Mahiru's apartment after dinner.
        <p></p>Amane had already known that Itsuki and Chitose were very close, and that Itsuki
        <p></p>often spent the night at Chitose's house. There wasn't anything strange about it, but
        <p></p>for some reason, he suddenly felt embarrassed to be confronted with the fact that
        <p></p>Itsuki often slept at Chitose's place.
        <p></p>Itsuki whispered, "Whatcha imagining over there, gloomy boy?"
        <p></p>Amane stomped on his friend's foot. He was merciful enough not to stomp on his
        <p></p>pinkie toe.
        <p></p>"Listen, man, stomping on my feet isn't gonna hide your shame forever!" Itsuki
        <p></p>grumbled.
        <p></p>"It's your fault for being such a jerk," Amane muttered as he turned away.
        <p></p>It's not like he'd been trying to hurt him or anything—Itsuki obviously knew that.
        <p></p>Neither of them were actually angry over a little playful roughhousing between friends.
        <p></p>"Actually, I've been staying at her place a ton recently. It's started to become kind of
        <p></p>the new normal, you know?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah, I get the picture. You can lay off already."
        <p></p>"I thought that kind of talk was standard between guys."
        <p></p>"It's not, and I can do without it."
        <p></p>Amane had no desire to hear the graphic details of his friend's romance, and he knew
        <p></p>that when the story was over, and he glared at Itsuki, Itsuki would cackle with laughter
        <p></p>and smile back at him cheerfully.
        <p></p>"You really are a herbivore, eh, Amane? Or is it just a lack of experience that's holding
        <p></p>you back?"
        <p></p>"I'll knock you on your ass."
        <p></p>"Well, I guess that's exactly why Shiina opened up to you in the first place, huh? She
        <p></p>probably wouldn't have gone anywhere near you if she knew you were on the prowl.
        <p></p>Good thing, too, huh?!"
        <p></p>Itsuki gave him a thumbs-up and a big grin. Amane shot him a bitter glare, the sort of
        <p></p>face he would never have shown Mahiru.
        <p></p>But it didn't seem to have the slightest effect on Itsuki, who merely laughed it off.
        <p></p>Amane was busy furiously scowling at his friend when his anger was interrupted by a
        <p></p>cheerful electronic tone from his smartphone—his text message alert. He stopped
        <p></p>glowering long enough to check the screen. The message was from Chitose.
        <p></p>Amane opened the messaging app, thinking that she must be asking about tomorrow's
        <p></p>plans, and saw that he had one message, and that it included a photograph.
        <p></p>"Look, look, Mahirun is sooo cute! FYI, I got her permission to send this."
        <p></p>There was just that one sentence and an attached photo.
        <p></p>The picture showed Mahiru sitting on top of a bed, holding the teddy bear that Amane
        <p></p>had given her propped up on her knees, with what looked like her bedroom in the
        <p></p>background. That was not what made Amane pause.
        <p></p>In the photo, Mahiru was wearing pajamas—specifically, a flowing, long-sleeved, lightpink gown, otherwise known as a negligee. She looked elegant and refined—and
        <p></p>hypnotically feminine. She had obviously just stepped out of the bath, and the skin
        <p></p>peeking from her sleeves and the open collar of her gown was still faintly flushed.
        <p></p>It was an incredibly suggestive image, even though nothing inappropriate was exposed.
        <p></p>She somehow looked modest and seductive at the same time.
        <p></p>And what drew his eyes more than anything else was Mahiru's expression. She wasn't
        <p></p>looking at the camera. Rather, her head hung slightly, and she kept her eyes downcast—
        <p></p>not enough to hide her face, but enough to give the impression of shyness.
        <p></p>The rosy spots on her cheeks were probably not just from the bath.
        <p></p>Mahiru's expression looked shy, but like she was yearning. It was way more enticing
        <p></p>than any expression he had ever seen before. But the teddy bear sitting in her lap also
        <p></p>made her look even more adorable than usual. It was just a photograph, but Amane
        <p></p>could feel his cheeks burning.
        <p></p>—That jerk!
        <p></p>What was Chitose trying to do, sending him a photo like this? Especially right before
        <p></p>bed? There was no way he was going to be able to sleep after seeing something like
        <p></p>that.
        <p></p>"Why are you blushing?" Itsuki inquired. "You looking at dirty pictures on your phone
        <p></p>or something?"
        <p></p>"Of course not!"
        <p></p>"Okay, then what are you looking at?"
        <p></p>Itsuki quickly peeked over his shoulder, and Amane had no time to hide the image. The
        <p></p>picture displayed on the screen was reflected in Itsuki's eyes, and he smiled knowingly.
        <p></p>"I see, I see. You really are one innocent boy, huh?"
        <p></p>"How about you go to sleep—forever?"
        <p></p>"Are you implying that you want me dead?"
        <p></p>"Should I say it directly?"
        <p></p>"That's awfully unkind of you. I mean, what man wouldn't get excited seeing an angel
        <p></p>like that? Though, I gotta say, Chi's still the cutest…"
        <p></p>"Stop going on about your girlfriend already, stupid."
        <p></p>Amane sighed in exasperation and brushed his hair back with his hand, and when he
        <p></p>did, he heard the clicking sound of a camera shutter.
        <p></p>"…Itsuki?"
        <p></p>"Nothing; just got a message from Chi telling me to take a picture of you to
        <p></p>commemorate the evening. Just a dumb little memento. Should be no problem, right?"
        <p></p>"I guess. As long as you're not planning to do anything with my photo…"
        <p></p>"Relax, it's not like anyone else will ever see it. And besides, there's a good reason for
        <p></p>it, I can assure you."
        <p></p>Amane regarded Itsuki with deep skepticism. He had no idea what that reason could
        <p></p>be. But Itsuki just smiled, looking particularly smug, and Amane let out a big sigh,
        <p></p>grumbling quietly to himself that there was no point in taking his photo.
        <p></p>Listening to his friend complain, Itsuki muttered in an even quieter voice, "This guy
        <p></p>really doesn't get it, does he?"
        <p></p>"…I'm exhausted…"
        <p></p>On the third day, Itsuki and Chitose's stay was finally over. The two of them had gone
        <p></p>back to Chitose's place, where Itsuki would spend another day or two. (Apparently
        <p></p>Chitose's parents would've been perfectly fine if he stayed forever, but all the same, he
        <p></p>didn't want to impose.) They'd eaten Mahiru's homemade lunch and left with big
        <p></p>smiles, but not before encouraging Amane and Mahiru to play nice in their absence.
        <p></p>Amane had figured that quipping back would have been more trouble than it was
        <p></p>worth, so he'd let their teasing slide.
        <p></p>"Aren't you tired, too, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>The two of them were sitting together on Amane's couch.
        <p></p>"…I'm wiped out. That was really hard. But it was also a lot of fun."
        <p></p>"Yeah?"
        <p></p>Mahiru wasn't the type to invite friends over to her apartment, at least for as long as
        <p></p>Amane had known her, so he thought it was great that Chitose had given her the excuse
        <p></p>to do just that.
        <p></p>It sounded like she sometimes hung out with Chitose when Amane wasn't around, so
        <p></p>if she had made a close friend, that couldn't be a bad thing.
        <p></p>"…Well, you know, I was really surprised when that photo was sent…"
        <p></p>"Ah, ah, oh that?"
        <p></p>When Mahiru said the word photo, Amane couldn't help but recall her elegant yet
        <p></p>risque getup from the night before. His cheeks were burning.
        <p></p>It wasn't like she had bared a lot of skin, but Amane could still remember the way her
        <p></p>nightgown had accentuated her soft curves. If anything, her modesty had only made
        <p></p>her more enticing. He'd already filed the image away in his mind for later, though he
        <p></p>felt surprisingly guilty about it.
        <p></p>"Y-yesterday," Mahiru explained, "yesterday, Chitose said 'You're so cute!' and took a
        <p></p>lot of photos. S-so, I'm not exactly sure which one she sent you. She was really insistent,
        <p></p>so I gave her my permission, but… I hope it wasn't anything too embarrassing…"
        <p></p>Apparently, Chitose hadn't shown Mahiru which photo she had sent. Amane figured
        <p></p>she'd sent him the best shot, but he wondered whether Mahiru was aware how she'd
        <p></p>looked—or even that Chitose had photographed that particular moment at all. He
        <p></p>wasn't sure how Mahiru would react if he showed her the picture. The photo wasn't
        <p></p>obscene or anything, and Mahiru definitely hadn't looked bad, but still, it could cause
        <p></p>a lot of trouble.
        <p></p>"Uh, ummm, well, it was… it was a picture of you with the teddy bear on your knees."
        <p></p>"…Th-the teddy bear…?"
        <p></p>"I guess you're taking good care of it, huh?"
        <p></p>Well, that part was true, at least.
        <p></p>Amane, still feeling guilty, decided the best thing to do was shove the image deep down
        <p></p>into the recesses of his memory. If he couldn't forget it, he could at least seal it away.
        <p></p>When Mahiru heard the word bear, she seemed to more or less recall the moment the
        <p></p>photo had been taken, and she smiled slightly.
        <p></p>"…I told you I was going to cherish it," she said, "because it's a precious gift."
        <p></p>Confronted with her warm gaze and soft, welcoming smile, Amane's breath caught in
        <p></p>his throat.
        <p></p>This smile was different from her usual angelic smile—it was honest and affectionate.
        <p></p>Amane felt hypnotized by her delicate beauty, like her soft sweetness was beckoning
        <p></p>him to wrap his arms around her and pull her close.
        <p></p>"…Uh, y-yeah, I guess you did," Amane stammered. "You must really like it, huh?"
        <p></p>"Of course I do," Mahiru replied. "You picked it out for me, after all." She smiled
        <p></p>earnestly. "You don't have to worry; I treat him well. Why, every day I pat him on the
        <p></p>head, and I hold him tight when I fall asleep, and—ummm… never mind. Forget I said
        <p></p>anything."
        <p></p>Amane could hardly believe he'd heard her right.
        <p></p>A beautiful girl like Mahiru sleeps with a stuffed teddy bear. That's unspeakably cute.
        <p></p>He recalled how angelic Mahiru looked when she was asleep. Just imagining the scene
        <p></p>made him blush.
        <p></p>Wearing that angelic sleeping face, she cuddles a stuffed bear while she slumbers.
        <p></p>Mahiru, this beautiful girl, goes to bed holding the teddy bear I gave her.
        <p></p>Mahiru had already turned bright red, all the way out to her ears. She grabbed him by
        <p></p>the arm. "P-please forget about that last part."
        <p></p>"Th-that's literally impossible."
        <p></p>"Ugh, I'm so embarrassed!"
        <p></p>Mahiru looked at him with tears forming in the corners of her eyes. This expression
        <p></p>was even more devastatingly cute than the last, but it was obvious that Mahiru didn't
        <p></p>realize it.
        <p></p>"Is it really that big a deal? I don't see what the problem is."
        <p></p>"It makes me seem like a little kid, doesn't it? Sleeping with a stuffed animal, I mean."
        <p></p>"N-no, I think it's really cute."
        <p></p>Mahiru turned away from Amane and buried her face in her favorite cushion. "You're
        <p></p>not helping…"
        <p></p>Amane felt awfully guilty for thinking that Mahiru looked cute when she was pouting,
        <p></p>but he couldn't help himself—he found it endearing.
        <p></p>What he wanted to do right then was reach out and stroke Mahiru's head, but he knew
        <p></p>that was a terrible idea, especially now, so he kept his hands to himself and only looked
        <p></p>over at Mahiru.
        <p></p>After a few moments had passed, she peeked out from behind the cushion. Her eyes
        <p></p>shimmered, and her face was flushed, but she composed herself enough to give him a
        <p></p>reproachful look.
        <p></p>"…Amane, you need to tell me something embarrassing, too. It's not fair if I'm the only
        <p></p>one."
        <p></p>"What…?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had done this to herself. Amane felt no responsibility to put himself in a similar
        <p></p>position. But he knew better than to say that.
        <p></p>On the other hand, he was having a hard time coming up with anything embarrassing
        <p></p>that she didn't already know.
        <p></p>"If you won't tell me something," Mahiru said sternly, "I'll just have to message
        <p></p>Akazawa and ask him."
        <p></p>"When did you exchange contact info with Itsuki…?"
        <p></p>"Actually, Chitose gave me his information, and we messaged back and forth…
        <p></p>yesterday, I think. But it wasn't about anything in particular… nothing you need to
        <p></p>worry about anyway…"
        <p></p>Mahiru trailed off and buried her face in the cushion again.
        <p></p>At this point, Amane really had no idea what was going on.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 24: An Incident and the Angel’s Truth 
        <p></p>Spring vacation meant quite a lot of free time for those without any particularly
        <p></p>involved hobbies. It wasn't that Amane had no interests, he just preferred activities
        <p></p>like reading and taking long walks. On occasion, his classmates made fun of him for
        <p></p>being so dull.
        <p></p>But Amane wasn't interested in sports or outdoor games. Unless he had somewhere
        <p></p>to be, his trips outside were for running or walking, or to go buy groceries, and that
        <p></p>was about it. Itsuki had always wondered why Amane didn't appreciate his youth
        <p></p>more, but Amane figured he got enough exercise to stay healthy.
        <p></p>Mahiru also didn't seem to go out much. Of course, he sometimes saw her exercising,
        <p></p>and she often ventured outside to buy things she needed, but she didn't really go out
        <p></p>specifically to do anything recreational.
        <p></p>"Don't you want to go somewhere for fun?"
        <p></p>When he asked Mahiru about it one day after dinner, she looked troubled for a moment,
        <p></p>then smiled and answered, "Go somewhere for fun…? Not right now, no. I'm kind of a
        <p></p>homebody."
        <p></p>Amane wasn't one to talk, but he wondered whether it was healthy for a beautiful high
        <p></p>school girl to stay in all the time. "Well, I guess I'm the same way, huh? I don't really
        <p></p>feel like going out anywhere, either."
        <p></p>"…What about going back to your parents' house?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"I saw them at New Year's, so I think I can take a pass. Plus, I'm supposed to be going
        <p></p>home this summer, too. And it would suck to miss out on your fantastic cooking."
        <p></p>"…I-is that so?"
        <p></p>Amane had definitely grown accustomed to enjoying Mahiru's cooking every day.
        <p></p>Spending so much time together seemed normal now. He appreciated Mahiru's
        <p></p>kindness and her beauty, and he felt calmer just being around her.
        <p></p>"Not to mention, if I go home, they'll just drag me around all over the place, and that
        <p></p>sounds exhausting."
        <p></p>"…Drag you around?"
        <p></p>"To resorts and shopping and stuff. If I don't have anything else to do, they take me
        <p></p>wherever they want to go. Once when I was in middle school, we even went to hot
        <p></p>spring resorts and stuff."
        <p></p>Amane's mother didn't really care whether they were spending time indoors or
        <p></p>outdoors—she could get excited about nearly anything as long as she was spending
        <p></p>time with family. Whenever Amane didn't have plans, she often tried to drag him with
        <p></p>her somewhere. She was usually kind enough to let him choose where they went, but
        <p></p>if he let her get away with it, she wouldn't hesitate to take advantage of him.
        <p></p>Amusement parks and shopping malls were charming enough, but Amane's mother
        <p></p>also enjoyed mountaineering and airsoft games, which were more intense. Amane had
        <p></p>never understood how she contained so much energy in her petite frame.
        <p></p>Thanks to his mother, Amane had learned how to do all sorts of things, and even stayed
        <p></p>in decent shape, but it was obvious that his own preference for quiet hobbies was
        <p></p>something of a reaction to his mother's riotous enthusiasm.
        <p></p>"…That sounds fun," Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"When it's every single day, you get tired of it pretty quick. I'd rather not start off a
        <p></p>new school year totally ragged after trying to keep up with her."
        <p></p>"Ha-ha, I can imagine."
        <p></p>"You'd understand if you came with me. Then she'd focus all her energy on you
        <p></p>instead."
        <p></p>"I s-suppose so…"
        <p></p>Amane was sure that his mother would be delighted to go out somewhere with
        <p></p>Mahiru. He didn't think she'd want to do anything too hardcore, but she would
        <p></p>definitely take her around shopping and stuff.
        <p></p>He knew that his mother had always wanted a daughter and would probably leap at
        <p></p>the chance to spend time with any girl right around this age, much less a girl like
        <p></p>Mahiru.
        <p></p>"You'll see, if you come to visit over the summer. She'll probably drag you all over the
        <p></p>place and treat you like a dress-up doll again."
        <p></p>"…Summer?"
        <p></p>"I have a feeling she's going to ask me to bring you home with me."
        <p></p>By which I mean she's actually already tried to pressure me into it.
        <p></p>As things stood, Shihoko was probably going to approach Mahiru directly by the time
        <p></p>summer vacation rolled around.
        <p></p>"Ah, well, if you hate the idea, feel free to decline."
        <p></p>"N-no, I don't hate it! If anything, I'm happy!"
        <p></p>Mahiru shook her head forcefully, and as her hair cascaded around her face, the scent
        <p></p>of her shampoo tickled Amane's nose.
        <p></p>"Mm. All right, I'll go ahead and tell Mom. I know she'll be happy to have you over."
        <p></p>"…Thank you."
        <p></p>"I should be the one thanking you for taking some of the burden."
        <p></p>"Oh, please." She slapped his upper arm gently.
        <p></p>Of course it didn't hurt, but Amane's heart started pounding the moment she touched
        <p></p>him.
        <p></p>"…Amane?"
        <p></p>"A-ah, nothing, it's nothing."
        <p></p>"You don't really look like it's nothing, but…"
        <p></p>"Honestly, don't worry about it. Oh, look at that. You got a message or something."
        <p></p>Amane was all too happy to change the subject. He pointed to Mahiru's phone. It was
        <p></p>vibrating and flashing a notification.
        <p></p>Thankfully, Mahiru shifted her attention to the phone. "What could this be?" she
        <p></p>muttered as she picked it up and opened the messaging application.
        <p></p>Of course Amane knew it would be rude to read over her shoulder, and he didn't
        <p></p>especially want to make eye contact with Mahiru at that exact moment, so he found
        <p></p>somewhere else to look, but… when he heard a soft thump, he looked back over to
        <p></p>Mahiru and froze.
        <p></p>Mahiru had dropped her phone onto the cushion on her knees and wore an expression
        <p></p>like a lost child, as if she was about to cry.
        <p></p>It wasn't just the tears collecting in her eyes or the odd twist in her mouth… She looked
        <p></p>like she might shatter if he so much as touched her.
        <p></p>Where have I seen this expression before?
        <p></p>Oh yeah, it reminds me of the first time we spoke.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"No, it's nothing. Please don't worry about it." Before Amane could even ask her what
        <p></p>was the matter, she answered in a rigid voice. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to be
        <p></p>getting home. I have some business to take care of tomorrow, so it seems I can't stay
        <p></p>for dinner. I'm sorry."
        <p></p>Mahiru did not give him the chance to argue. She quickly collected her things and left.
        <p></p>Amane moved to stop her, but she either didn't notice or deliberately ignored him. He
        <p></p>was left reaching out to empty air.
        <p></p>…Why, so suddenly?
        <p></p>He was certain that it must have had something to do with the message she'd received.
        <p></p>As far as Amane knew, there was only one thing that could make her look that way.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru's… parents."
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't give her contact information to very many people, so only a very limited
        <p></p>number of people knew her message app ID. There was Amane and his mother,
        <p></p>Chitose and Itsuki, and he had heard that a few of the girls in her class who could keep
        <p></p>a secret knew it as well. Aside from those people, he deduced that the only other
        <p></p>people who might know it were her parents.
        <p></p>He had to assume that the message had come from them.
        <p></p>And suddenly saying that she had business to take care of tomorrow, when she hadn't
        <p></p>mentioned anything the day before, must mean that Mahiru was probably going to
        <p></p>meet them. He knew she had a difficult relationship with her parents, which explained
        <p></p>the gloomy expression he saw just moments ago.
        <p></p>Well, he might have determined the source of Mahiru's consternation, but there wasn't
        <p></p>much he could do with that information.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru."
        <p></p>He had caught a glimpse of her face, crumpled and twisted, as she left. He hadn't said
        <p></p>anything. Feeling helpless, he quietly muttered her name, letting his fist fall to the
        <p></p>cushion that, until just a moment ago, she'd been holding.
        <p></p>The weather was bad that day.
        <p></p>Dark, heavy clouds blanketed the sky, and when Amane looked out the window, he
        <p></p>couldn't see a single ray of sunlight. If anything was going to come down from that sky,
        <p></p>it would be raindrops.
        <p></p>Perhaps that was the reason it was so chilly, despite the end of March quickly coming
        <p></p>up.
        <p></p>Amane turned on the heater and had a seat on the couch, but somehow he couldn't
        <p></p>compose himself. Without meaning to, his gaze kept drifting in the direction of
        <p></p>Mahiru's apartment.
        <p></p>Today must be the day that she's going to see her parents, huh?
        <p></p>She had already informed him that she wasn't going to make dinner tonight, probably
        <p></p>because she didn't want anyone to see her so emotional.
        <p></p>Just remembering what Mahiru looked like wearing such a hurt expression placed a
        <p></p>somber, disagreeable feeling in Amane's chest, like the dregs of something dark had
        <p></p>collected there.
        <p></p>He was so worried that he nearly sent her a text asking if she needed anything before
        <p></p>deciding against it. He was incredibly agitated, but looking around his room, he
        <p></p>realized there was nothing he could do, so for the moment, he decided to head to the
        <p></p>supermarket to secure dinner.
        <p></p>Even when he was out shopping, no matter what he did, Amane couldn't get the image
        <p></p>of Mahiru's sad expression out of his mind. He imagined how painful it must be for her
        <p></p>to have to meet her parents, if that was the kind of face she made.
        <p></p>She had looked like she was afraid, he thought, pressing his lips together. Amane tried
        <p></p>not to scowl, so that he wouldn't look like some crazy guy, but no matter what he tried,
        <p></p>he just couldn't cheer himself up.
        <p></p>Then he dropped a premade entre e into his shopping basket a little too roughly,
        <p></p>making it all slosh around, and felt even worse.
        <p></p>Sighing deeply the whole while, Amane paid for his things and slowly walked home
        <p></p>under the cloudy sky—and then, when he took the elevator to his floor, he got a strange
        <p></p>feeling. Just as he was about to step out into the hallway, Amane paused, lingering in
        <p></p>the shadows of the elevator.
        <p></p>There were two people standing in front of the door to Mahiru's apartment.
        <p></p>One of them was a girl with familiar flaxen hair—it was Mahiru.
        <p></p>And the other was a woman he had never seen before.
        <p></p>Even at that distance, he could tell that she was quite beautiful. And she was tall as
        <p></p>well, especially compared to the petite Mahiru—by Amane's estimate, she seemed
        <p></p>taller than the average man. But her body was undeniably feminine. He could see her
        <p></p>ample curves even under her fitted pantsuit and noted that she had an almost perfect
        <p></p>figure.
        <p></p>Her medium-length light-brown hair hung loosely down to her shoulders, and she
        <p></p>carried herself with unmistakable poise. Her eyes were framed precisely with eyeliner,
        <p></p>but Amane didn't think she needed any makeup to look bold and assertive. Even
        <p></p>standing facing Mahiru, her stern gaze showed no sign of softening.
        <p></p>She was quite a beauty, but her entire persona was incredibly intimidating. She looked
        <p></p>like an extremely capable woman who was impossible to approach under normal
        <p></p>circumstances.
        <p></p>Comparing her to the neat and tidy lily that was Mahiru, this woman was like a striking
        <p></p>rose. That's how different the two of them were in appearance and temperament.
        <p></p>"Really, you're such a wretched little girl! And you look just like him. There's nothing I
        <p></p>hate more."
        <p></p>Amane stared in disbelief as vicious words slithered past the woman's crimsonpainted lips. He was sure that this person was Mahiru's mother, but when she spoke
        <p></p>to Mahiru, it was with a voice full of scorn. He could hardly believe that Mahiru
        <p></p>endured such cruelty at the hands of her own parent.
        <p></p>"At least if you resembled me more it would be a little better… but you had to look like
        <p></p>him. Well, it is what it is. Once you graduate, I won't have to deal with you anymore, so
        <p></p>there's no point worrying about it now. We can send the necessary paperwork through
        <p></p>the mail like always."
        <p></p>"…Yes," Mahiru replied feebly.
        <p></p>The woman snorted and turned on her heel. "This is good-bye, then. And don't bother
        <p></p>me with pointless nonsense anymore."
        <p></p>She was heading for the elevator, so Amane didn't have much choice but to step out
        <p></p>into the hall. The woman glanced at him briefly as they passed each other but left
        <p></p>without saying another word.
        <p></p>Mahiru was still standing there, and when she recognized Amane, her face distorted
        <p></p>into a grimace.
        <p></p>"…Did you overhear?"
        <p></p>"Sorry."
        <p></p>He didn't lie. He apologized frankly.
        <p></p>Though he hadn't intended to eavesdrop, he hadn't dared come out of hiding while
        <p></p>they were talking. Plus, he hadn't wanted to abandon Mahiru in her current state.
        <p></p>"So that woman was—"
        <p></p>"…Sayo Shiina. My birth mother."
        <p></p>Recently, Mahiru had been acting a lot more affectionate, but right now she was far
        <p></p>stiffer than when they had first met, and when she spoke, her voice was stilted and
        <p></p>ragged.
        <p></p>"I'll just go ahead and say this," Mahiru continued before Amane could ask. "She's
        <p></p>always been like that, so I'm used to it." Her voice was distant and monotonous. "My
        <p></p>mother has hated me for as long as I can remember, and it's too late for that to change,
        <p></p>so please don't worry about it."
        <p></p>Stress, pain, heartbreak—Mahiru could not hide what she was feeling. Even Amane
        <p></p>could see through her brave facade. He didn't stop to think about it—quietly, he took
        <p></p>Mahiru's hand as she turned toward her apartment.
        <p></p>He fully believed that his instincts were right this time.
        <p></p>Because if he left her alone like this, it seemed likely that Mahiru's thoughts would
        <p></p>head in a bad direction.
        <p></p>She looked at him blankly, then gave him a feeble smile and tried to shake off his hand.
        <p></p>But Amane gripped more tightly, determined not to let go. He didn't squeeze too hard
        <p></p>but held her slender wrist firmly.
        <p></p>"We're sticking together," Amane declared in the kind of authoritative tone he would
        <p></p>normally never direct at Mahiru.
        <p></p>Her face twisted into an awkward smile.
        <p></p>"…Really, it's fine. You don't need to worry."
        <p></p>"Well, I want to be with you."
        <p></p>He knew he was being awfully presumptuous, but he didn't intend to back down now.
        <p></p>He stared at Mahiru, and eventually she flashed him an exhausted smile and stopped
        <p></p>trying to pull away.
        <p></p>That was good enough for Amane. He led Mahiru into his apartment and sat her down
        <p></p>on the sofa.
        <p></p>Smiling weakly, Mahiru looked like she would blow apart after one stiff breeze. Still
        <p></p>gripping her hand, Amane took a seat next to her, then let go of her wrist and placed
        <p></p>her palms in his.
        <p></p>Slowly, Mahiru seemed to relax a bit.
        <p></p>"…It's not the best story, but here goes."
        <p></p>After almost ten minutes had passed, Mahiru finally broke the silence.
        <p></p>"My parents didn't marry for love," she said quietly. "They keep the exact circumstances
        <p></p>a secret, but they only got married as part of a deal between the two families."
        <p></p>That kind of marriage, based on family interests rather than love and trust, was rarely
        <p></p>seen in modern Japan. It wasn't unheard of, but to Amane, it sounded like something
        <p></p>out of an old storybook. He knew that Mahiru came from an upper-class family, but…
        <p></p>even so, he almost found it difficult to believe.
        <p></p>"And so… the truth is, they never really wanted a child. I was simply the result of one
        <p></p>night's indiscretion. Unfortunately, after I was born, they had no choice but to support
        <p></p>me financially… but that's all. I don't think they ever had any intention of raising me."
        <p></p>"What do you mean by that?"
        <p></p>"…They rarely ever came home. Even when they did, they just used the house as a place
        <p></p>to stay briefly. When I was younger, I hardly ever saw their faces."
        <p></p>Mahiru's voice was quiet and taut. She looked utterly exhausted.
        <p></p>"I can't remember them ever doing anything parental. I was actually raised by our
        <p></p>housekeeper. Mother had many affairs and usually stayed with her lovers, and Father
        <p></p>was too devoted to his work to have any time for me. He probably had his own affairs
        <p></p>as well… Anyway, they gave me plenty of money and left me alone. They said they
        <p></p>didn't need a child in their lives. No matter how hard I tried, no matter what I did, they
        <p></p>never once looked my way."
        <p></p>Amane finally understood why Mahiru acted like an angel.
        <p></p>She had spent her entire life trying to convince her parents she was worthy of their
        <p></p>attention, even if only for a moment, by performing the role of the perfect child, and
        <p></p>now she didn't know how to stop being perfect. That or she felt like she had no choice
        <p></p>but to hide her feelings behind her angelic mask. Either way, Amane realized that the
        <p></p>angel persona had never been something Mahiru took up by choice.
        <p></p>"Ultimately, they never cared. Even though I grew up pretty, even though I got good
        <p></p>grades, even though I was good at sports, even though I could do housework… those
        <p></p>people never once looked my way. What a fool I was, trying so hard with nothing to
        <p></p>show for it."
        <p></p>Amane felt his chest tighten as he listened to her despair.
        <p></p>"And because of my inconvenient existence, they can't even get a divorce. Neither one
        <p></p>of them wants to be the one to leave. It would cause trouble both in their family life
        <p></p>and at work. They wouldn't be able to expect any support from my grandparents. So
        <p></p>they're waiting until I finish university. Once I'm independent, we won't see one
        <p></p>another anymore."
        <p></p>"That's…"
        <p></p>"When my mother told me to my face that she didn't want me… it was a shock. I felt so
        <p></p>lost. I sat out in the rain in a daze."
        <p></p>That was why Mahiru had been in the park all those months ago, Amane realized. She
        <p></p>had been wandering around in pain because of her mother's cruelty. She must have
        <p></p>felt like she didn't belong anywhere—that was why she had looked so anxious and
        <p></p>hopeless, like a lost child with no one to turn to for help. Not knowing what to do, she
        <p></p>had lingered there in the park, alone with her mother's hateful words.
        <p></p>As Amane imagined the scene, he felt the slight taste of iron spread through his mouth.
        <p></p>It occurred to him that he had been biting his lip when he recognized the taste of
        <p></p>blood. He was having trouble containing his outrage at this tragedy.
        <p></p>"…If I was going to be that much trouble, she could have just not had me."
        <p></p>Her tiny whisper struck him like a stake driven through his chest, pinning him in place.
        <p></p>He was so angry at her parents that he could hardly think. Because of their neglect,
        <p></p>Mahiru had grown up hiding her feelings, acting like she was strong while she silently
        <p></p>agonized behind her mask of angelic perfection. Amane wanted to shout at them, to
        <p></p>demand to know how they could treat her this way. But the people who had
        <p></p>abandoned Mahiru were not around.
        <p></p>And besides, Amane wasn't sure what he should actually do in this situation.
        <p></p>He was certainly furious at her awful parents, but he was also an outsider, and he
        <p></p>didn't think Mahiru would appreciate him poking his nose into her family business.
        <p></p>He might just end up making everything worse. When he considered that he might
        <p></p>only hurt Mahiru with his reckless words, he decided to hold his tongue.
        <p></p>But it seemed like Mahiru would dissolve into thin air if he left her like this—so Amane
        <p></p>took the blanket that was on the couch next to him and wrapped it around Mahiru's
        <p></p>shoulders. She looked surprised, but he pulled the blanket over her head and folded
        <p></p>her into his arms.
        <p></p>This was the first time the two of them had really embraced, and her body felt tentative
        <p></p>and fragile. He was almost afraid that she'd shatter if he squeezed just a little too hard.
        <p></p>But it occurred to Amane that the person in his arms had learned that she was
        <p></p>supposed to live without relying on anyone.
        <p></p>"Wha—? A-Amane…?"
        <p></p>"…I finally feel like I understand why you are the way you are."
        <p></p>"You mean why I'm so pathetic?"
        <p></p>"No… I mean how you'll try to endure any hardship—and why you never let your
        <p></p>guard down."
        <p></p>Mahiru had never been able to rely on anyone, but she had refused to let that break
        <p></p>her. The maid had provided what help she could, but she was only an employee, not
        <p></p>family. Mahiru had learned to persevere in life on her own, and she had obviously
        <p></p>gotten quite good at it.
        <p></p>"Look… I'm not going to interfere with your family situation," Amane said. "I know
        <p></p>better than to stick my nose into other people's business."
        <p></p>Amane was an outsider. There knew it was best to respect the depths when it came to
        <p></p>complicated family relationships. However, that was not the same as saying that he
        <p></p>wasn't going to support Mahiru.
        <p></p>"…But if you need to cry or anything, go right ahead. I'll even pretend like I can't see
        <p></p>you. It must be suffocating to have to suffer through such awful stuff."
        <p></p>He didn't actually want to make her cry, but if she kept bottling it up like this, at some
        <p></p>point, she would crack.
        <p></p>So he wanted her to let out all her frustrations, everything she was holding back, and
        <p></p>cry if she needed. And he would be there by her side if she needed him, too.
        <p></p>He couldn't do much other than support her.
        <p></p>Amane wondered if he wasn't being too presumptuous, but as Mahiru wriggled in his
        <p></p>arms and buried her face in Amane's chest, all that apprehension disappeared.
        <p></p>"…Will you keep it a secret?" she asked in a small voice.
        <p></p>"I can't see you, so I know nothing."
        <p></p>"…All right then, just for a little bit… let me lean on you," she mumbled. It was the first
        <p></p>time she had ever asked him for support.
        <p></p>Amane didn't respond—he felt like he might be the one to cry if he tried. Instead, he
        <p></p>just pulled the blanket farther up over Mahiru's shoulders and held her tight.
        <p></p>"…Promise you didn't look?"
        <p></p>Mahiru hadn't cried for long, maybe ten minutes, tops.
        <p></p>It would have been great if she could have cried enough to get out sixteen years' worth
        <p></p>of anguish, but that seemed like more than her body could handle right now. If she
        <p></p>added physical fatigue to her mental stress, her brain would probably just shut down.
        <p></p>Mahiru's cheeks were wet when she lifted her face, but she seemed to have recovered
        <p></p>a little of her spirit, because when her eyes met Amane's, her gaze did not waver.
        <p></p>"Well, you were leaning up against me, so I couldn't really see much. I definitely didn't
        <p></p>see you crying or anything."
        <p></p>Mahiru had slipped off the blanket and smiled gently.
        <p></p>"…Amane?"
        <p></p>"What is it?"
        <p></p>"…Thank you."
        <p></p>"I don't know what you're talking about," Amane replied, looking in the other
        <p></p>direction. He didn't feel like he'd done anything worth thanking him for.
        <p></p>Mahiru buried her face in his chest again.
        <p></p>"Let me stay here a little bit longer, please."
        <p></p>"…Sure."
        <p></p>It wasn't like he could push Mahiru aside when she was in this state even if he wanted
        <p></p>to. Besides, he wanted to support her however he could. Calmly, he put his arm around
        <p></p>her again and gently stroked her hair.
        <p></p>If nobody else will tell her how wonderful she is, I'll do it myself, Amane thought. He
        <p></p>wanted her to feel like she didn't have to try so hard anymore. Like she could relax,
        <p></p>now that she was with him.
        <p></p>Mahiru must have calmed down somewhat. When she looked up at Amane, she didn't
        <p></p>seem so upset. But she didn't look especially cheerful, either. She probably still had a
        <p></p>lot on her mind.
        <p></p>"…I wonder what I should do now," Mahiru mumbled quietly. She gave a troubled smile
        <p></p>as she looked into Amane's eyes.
        <p></p>"I can try my hardest all I want, but my parents won't even look at me. Even if other
        <p></p>people heap on the praise, call me an angel and whatever else, that doesn't mean a
        <p></p>thing. Sure, the Mahiru Shiina that they all know, the angel, is idolized and popular,
        <p></p>but… nobody cares about the real me. And the worst part is that it's all my fault. I set
        <p></p>myself up this way." She smiled bitterly and grasped the fabric of Amane's shirt tightly.
        <p></p>"The real me is cowardly and selfish and dull, and… there's just nothing there to like."
        <p></p>"I like you a fair bit," Amane answered without thinking. Mahiru looked surprised as
        <p></p>he continued, "I mean, sure, you're not a hundred percent perfect all the time, but I
        <p></p>really do think you're charming, and I always admire your honesty. You're being too
        <p></p>hard on yourself." He reached out and tapped her lightly on the forehead. "Besides, if
        <p></p>you were as selfish as you said, you wouldn't care about what other people think."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked stunned. But the sorrow had faded from her expression.
        <p></p>Amane just couldn't understand why Mahiru was always putting herself down. Surely
        <p></p>anyone could see for themselves that she was a hardworking person and a
        <p></p>tenderhearted girl. She was honest but considerate, and though she had called herself
        <p></p>cowardly, Amane knew that Mahiru had been hurt so much before that it made sense
        <p></p>for her to assume a defensive posture by default.
        <p></p>And besides, if she really was so dull, why was Amane always agonizing over her?
        <p></p>He only wished she knew how much more charming she was when she was her honest
        <p></p>self with him.
        <p></p>"Don't put yourself down like that," Amane said, gazing into Mahiru's caramel-colored
        <p></p>eyes. "After all, there's someone right here who has seen the real you and adores you."
        <p></p>Mahiru was convinced that nobody loved her. That must have been why she had no
        <p></p>confidence. But Amane wasn't the only person who liked her—even Chitose had
        <p></p>grown really attached to her. Mahiru was obviously wrong about herself.
        <p></p>She looked away from Amane, and her cheeks started to turn red as she pulled herself
        <p></p>into a ball. Amane realized what he had said and began to blush as well.
        <p></p>"I—I mean, Chitose and everybody thinks so, too! So don't get the wrong idea," Amane
        <p></p>explained frantically. "But anyway, it's not just me. My parents, and Chitose and Itsuki,
        <p></p>too—they all saw the parts of you that aren't the angel you always pretend to be, and
        <p></p>they all still like being around you! Honestly, you're much more… well, I think your
        <p></p>personality is much more likable than you think."
        <p></p>Amane obviously hadn't done a good job explaining himself. Mahiru's face was still
        <p></p>bright red. Amane had become pretty embarrassed himself—after all, he was the one
        <p></p>saying all that stuff.
        <p></p>"So look, if you want to stop trying so hard because your parents are going hate you
        <p></p>no matter what, then you're welcome to escape to my house whenever you feel like it.
        <p></p>If my folks know the situation, they'll gladly take you in. You can think of it like time to
        <p></p>recuperate."
        <p></p>"…Mm."
        <p></p>"My mom and dad have really taken a liking to you, so I think they would probably let
        <p></p>you stay for a long time… Actually, they might not leave you alone until you cheer up.
        <p></p>None of us can decide for you what you should do about your parents, but we can take
        <p></p>care of you until you reach a decision and keep supporting you after."
        <p></p>"Mm…"
        <p></p>Amane was trying his best not to come across the wrong way, but Mahiru started
        <p></p>crying again.
        <p></p>"Wh-why are you crying?"
        <p></p>"I just… feel so lucky."
        <p></p>"I dunno; you seem pretty much the opposite to me…"
        <p></p>Maybe Mahiru was blessed when it came to money, but aside from that, nobody gave
        <p></p>her anything. She hadn't received one bit of the love she deserved. Honestly, it was a
        <p></p>wonder she had grown up without becoming twisted and bitter.
        <p></p>Someone should take care of this Mahiru. And Mahiru should take care of herself, too.
        <p></p>She should take back a little of what no one offered her, he thought.
        <p></p>"…In that case, can I make some requests?"
        <p></p>"What will it be? I'll do whatever I can."
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled a little. "They're things only you can do, Amane," she murmured. "Like,
        <p></p>look at me more."
        <p></p>"I already can't take my eyes off you," he replied. "I'm in awe of everything you do."
        <p></p>"Also, hold me more."
        <p></p>He peered down at Mahiru, wondering if that was all.
        <p></p>"I'm already holding your hand."
        <p></p>Mahiru stared at Amane for a moment, then looked bashful.
        <p></p>"For today, hold me with your whole body."
        <p></p>As soon as she finished her sentence, she wrapped her arms around Amane's neck and
        <p></p>buried her face in his chest again. Amane was startled for a moment but knew that he
        <p></p>mustn't get any rude ideas. He swallowed deeply and once again embraced her delicate
        <p></p>body.

        <p></p>Chapter 25: The Angel’s Metamorphosis 
        <p></p>Mahiru was acting strange the following day as well.
        <p></p>To be more precise, she didn't appear as dejected as she had the day before, nor did
        <p></p>she look especially sad. But she was very stiff and seemed wary in a way that was
        <p></p>difficult to describe.
        <p></p>Even though he was just sitting beside Mahiru on the living room sofa, Amane felt like
        <p></p>she was surrounded by an air of crackling tension. When he tried to so much as glance
        <p></p>at her, she practically jumped, squeezing her favorite cushion tight. However, Amane
        <p></p>could also tell by looking at the reflection in his smartphone screen that whenever he
        <p></p>looked away from her, she stared directly at him.
        <p></p>He wondered why she was acting this way—and soon came to the conclusion that it
        <p></p>must be because of what had happened the day before.
        <p></p>…She must still feel pretty awkward.
        <p></p>Yesterday, the two of them had embraced—and even though he had been doing it to
        <p></p>console her, he was worried that it was going to cause problems for their relationship.
        <p></p>Clinging to him may have been a momentary impulse, and there was a chance she
        <p></p>regretted it now that she had come back to her senses.
        <p></p>Recently, they'd had a lot of close, physical contact, but this was the first time she had
        <p></p>pressed herself against him so boldly. It was inevitable that she would feel a little
        <p></p>rattled afterward.
        <p></p>Though it doesn't seem like she hates me for it or anything.
        <p></p>If she did, he reasoned, she wouldn't be here, in his apartment, sitting next to him.
        <p></p>But whenever he reached out toward her, she pulled away from him.
        <p></p>"…Should I just give you some space?"
        <p></p>"N-no, that's not it."
        <p></p>He had figured it would be best to keep his distance for a while until she had calmed
        <p></p>down, and had suggested as much, but Mahiru hurriedly shook her head.
        <p></p>"Th-this is, well… I'm just ashamed because you saw me in such a pathetic state. I cried
        <p></p>so hard…"
        <p></p>"Ah… I see…"
        <p></p>Apparently, she was embarrassed by all the tears. He recalled that after her sobs had
        <p></p>subsided the other night, she'd chilled the area around her eyes with ice, so it wouldn't
        <p></p>swell up. But nothing she did could change the fact that Amane had seen her in that
        <p></p>vulnerable state, which seemed to really upset her.
        <p></p>"Well, it didn't really bother me, so—"
        <p></p>"But it bothers me. It was the biggest mistake of my life to let you see me like that."
        <p></p>"That's going a little far… Look, if you bottle all those things up, it's obvious that
        <p></p>eventually you're going to explode, dummy."
        <p></p>It seemed like Mahiru was about to put on one of her characteristic shows of courage,
        <p></p>so Amane sighed, and before she could stop him, he reached out and pinched her
        <p></p>cheek. Her skin was soft and supple between his fingers.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked confused and nervous. She stared hard at Amane. "Hey, what are you
        <p></p>doing?"
        <p></p>"If you don't let your feelings out, you're going to crack at some point. It's okay to let
        <p></p>other people support you, really. If I'm acceptable, then you can depend on me. If you
        <p></p>want to cry, I'll cover you up anytime and pretend I can't see you. You need to learn to
        <p></p>let other people take care of you a little."
        <p></p>Yesterday, she had let some of what she had pent up come bursting out, but it seemed
        <p></p>like there was a lot more where that came from. Criticizing Mahiru for her reluctance,
        <p></p>he pinched her cheek hard as admonishment.
        <p></p>If she was to say that Amane was unreliable and that she couldn't depend on him, he
        <p></p>would resign himself to that assessment and accept his dismissal. But as long as that
        <p></p>wasn't the case, he wanted her to rely on him more and give him a chance to take care
        <p></p>of her sometimes. He wanted to be there for her, especially when she had nobody else.
        <p></p>"Yesterday, you nodded like you understood, so why are you backtracking on that
        <p></p>now? You can depend on me. You are not alone."
        <p></p>"…Not alone…" Mahiru nodded as she considered his words. She looked positively
        <p></p>dumbfounded by the notion that she did not have to endure everything by herself.
        <p></p>Amane ruffled her hair. "I'm always in your corner. If you call them, Chitose and Itsuki
        <p></p>will show up, too, as will my parents. That's how many people care about you—about
        <p></p>the real Mahiru."
        <p></p>Mahiru had lamented the fact that no one wanted her. But that was in the past. Things
        <p></p>were different now. There were so many people who cherished Mahiru and wanted to
        <p></p>help her. She had to know how much she meant to everyone.
        <p></p>Mahiru was silent for a little while as she considered what Amane had said. Then,
        <p></p>timidly, she looked up at him, with eyes that were searching for reassurance.
        <p></p>"…And you?"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"Do you also care about me…?"
        <p></p>Amane's breath caught in his throat for a moment, then he scratched his cheek. "I
        <p></p>mean… if we're sitting here together like this, that must mean I care about you quite a
        <p></p>lot."
        <p></p>Amane knew he could be pretty aloof. He just wasn't interested in spending a lot of
        <p></p>energy on a relationship with somebody unless they were really important to him. But
        <p></p>when he did care about someone, he was always willing to go to whatever lengths
        <p></p>were necessary to help them.
        <p></p>And he had cared about Mahiru for a long time now.
        <p></p>He wanted to take some of the painful burden off of her delicate shoulders. He wanted
        <p></p>her to smile peacefully. He wanted her to be happy—he wanted to make her happy.
        <p></p>"…Really…?"
        <p></p>Mahiru mumbled, burying her face in the cushion. Amane figured it must be pretty
        <p></p>embarrassing to hear all that out loud. On the other hand, he was the one who'd had
        <p></p>to say all that out loud, so if anyone was going to be embarrassed, it was him.
        <p></p>…Though I'm sure that Mahiru won't take it the wrong way.
        <p></p>He was really worried she might think he was trying to take advantage of her
        <p></p>vulnerability. Obviously, if that's what she thought, their time together would quickly
        <p></p>end.
        <p></p>Fortunately, Mahiru didn't seem to have noticed Amane's anxiety.
        <p></p>She slowly lifted her face out of the cushion and glanced up at him.
        <p></p>"…Amane?"
        <p></p>"What's up?"
        <p></p>"W-would you, um, turn and face the other way?"
        <p></p>"Huh? Why?"
        <p></p>"D-don't worry about why…"
        <p></p>He was confused as to why she was suddenly asking him to turn around, but he
        <p></p>obediently turned his back to Mahiru.
        <p></p>He was waiting anxiously, sitting cross-legged on the sofa, when he felt something soft
        <p></p>and warm press against his back. That was enough of a surprise to make Amane go
        <p></p>completely stiff, and when her slender arms wrapped around his chest, he was
        <p></p>practically petrified.
        <p></p>Mahiru was obviously hugging him from behind. At the moment, Amane was grateful
        <p></p>that she wasn't doing it from the front.
        <p></p>"…Uh, Ma-Mahiru…?" Amane stammered, feeling his heart pounding in his chest.
        <p></p>She stirred slightly, still clinging to his back. "…So about yesterday… thank you very
        <p></p>much. I wanted to tell you again how grateful I am."
        <p></p>Maybe that was why she was holding on to him this way. It was easier for her to thank
        <p></p>him if he wasn't looking right at her.
        <p></p>"O-okay…"
        <p></p>"…You've given me so, so much, Amane."
        <p></p>"B-but I really didn't do anything special…"
        <p></p>"You may think it's not important, but it's a big deal to me. So again, thank you."
        <p></p>"…Sure."
        <p></p>"I'm so glad to have you by my side. I'm not sure how well I could deal with everything
        <p></p>if I had to face it alone."
        <p></p>"…Oh?"
        <p></p>This was probably Mahiru's way of showing him that she cared.
        <p></p>Amane was happy that Mahiru felt like she could lean on him. He put his hands over
        <p></p>hers, wanting to let her know that he had no intention of leaving her alone. When he
        <p></p>did, her whole body suddenly shuddered.
        <p></p>Realizing that he had probably gotten too carried away again, Amane pulled his hand
        <p></p>away in a panic, but Mahiru explained in a voice that was muffled because her face
        <p></p>was slightly buried in his back. "I-it's okay; I was just surprised…" One of her hands
        <p></p>roamed around, trying to find Amane's again.
        <p></p>Feeling relieved, Amane grasped Mahiru's hand, and this time she squeezed him back.
        <p></p>Amane shivered in surprise, and when he did, he felt Mahiru's head press against his
        <p></p>back.
        <p></p>"…Weren't you going to be the one holding me?"
        <p></p>"I-if you're okay with that…"
        <p></p>"You're the only person I would ever do something like this with, Amane," she said
        <p></p>sweetly. "The only one."
        <p></p>Amane stiffened again. He felt Mahiru trying to bury her face in his back. She must
        <p></p>have been pretty embarrassed after her sudden confession. Even so, Mahiru didn't let
        <p></p>him go, and he felt like she must trust him a great deal, and that made him so selfconscious he wanted to tear his own heart out. In fact, Amane was sure he was even
        <p></p>more embarrassed than Mahiru was.
        <p></p>Eventually, Mahiru seemed to calm down, and once again she squeezed Amane's hand
        <p></p>tightly.
        <p></p>"…A-anyway, like you promised… please see me for who I really am. Never take your
        <p></p>eyes off me."
        <p></p>"S-sure. But I… uh… can't really see you right now…"
        <p></p>"Well, if you looked at me now, I'd get mad."
        <p></p>"O-oh, of course… Well, I definitely cannot see you when we sit like this, so… I guess
        <p></p>you can relax."
        <p></p>He knew she was probably trying to hide her embarrassment, so he obediently
        <p></p>followed her instructions. More importantly, trying to take a peek would just upset
        <p></p>her.
        <p></p>Besides, Amane thought, covering his face with his free hand, it's better if she doesn't
        <p></p>see me right now, either. He let out a quiet sigh.
        <p></p>…At this point, it would be weirder if I didn't fall for her.
        <p></p>"The new semester is starting soon, huh?"
        <p></p>It was several days after Mahiru's tearful revelation. She seemed totally back to
        <p></p>normal—she wasn't acting tense or stealing awkward glances at him or anything. And
        <p></p>when she looked up from the textbook she was reading and muttered to Amane, it was
        <p></p>like she had just remembered what day it was.
        <p></p>Since their talk, the two of them had gotten even closer. Maybe it was because they
        <p></p>were reading from the same book, but there were probably currently only two or three
        <p></p>hands' worth of open space between them. They were close enough that Amane could
        <p></p>feel Mahiru's warmth and smell the sweet scent coming off her. From time to time,
        <p></p>something soft would bump into him.
        <p></p>Amane was only just barely holding it together.
        <p></p>"G-guess it does, y-yeah. Once this weekend is over, it'll be a whole new semester. Kind
        <p></p>of depressing that there'll be a class change."
        <p></p>"In what way…?"
        <p></p>"I'm not good at making friends, so once Itsuki's gone, I won't have anyone to hang out
        <p></p>with."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked surprised. "How can you be so sure of that…?"
        <p></p>"Don't get me wrong, I can carry on a normal conversation as good as the next guy. But
        <p></p>I never get past being acquaintances, that's all."
        <p></p>Amane sort of knew how to talk to people all right, but that wasn't the same as making
        <p></p>friends. He just felt like his personality didn't have much to offer, and he certainly
        <p></p>wasn't particularly charming, so he'd usually had trouble making friends. He had
        <p></p>always been more of a background character anyway.
        <p></p>But he was the type of person who was just fine on his own, and if he was separated
        <p></p>from Itsuki, that was just the way things went and couldn't be helped. He would simply
        <p></p>spend the year on his own.
        <p></p>"…You don't ever take the first step forward, do you, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Uh—"
        <p></p>"You're a good person. I think it's a shame that you don't know anyone outside of Itsuki
        <p></p>and Chitose. People would like you if they just got to know you a little, so you should
        <p></p>really dial back the whole aloof and indifferent act. There's no reason to keep everyone
        <p></p>at arm's length all the time. It's a waste of potential." She reached over and brushed
        <p></p>his bangs out of his eyes.
        <p></p>Amane felt intensely embarrassed and tried to looked anywhere else instead of at
        <p></p>Mahiru.
        <p></p>"…I don't really want to get to know a lot of people, is the thing. I think I'm good with
        <p></p>being close to a very limited number of people."
        <p></p>"Why do you feel that way?"
        <p></p>"Why…?"
        <p></p>That seemed obvious to him.
        <p></p>—I'm afraid of being betrayed. Like I was in the past.
        <p></p>Amane thought it was best to only get close to people he was absolutely sure he could
        <p></p>trust. That was how he had come to his current social standing.
        <p></p>"…Well, I don't really need anyone else. As long as I've got you, I'm good."
        <p></p>"…Huh?"
        <p></p>"W-wait, that's not what I meant! I was thinking more like, I'm happy as long as I've
        <p></p>got my close friends, including Itsuki and Chitose, too. I don't want a lot of excitement
        <p></p>in my life," Amane explained at light speed. He didn't want her to get the wrong
        <p></p>impression… even if that impression would have been more accurate than he wanted
        <p></p>to admit.
        <p></p>Mahiru was looking at him with an expression of mixed relief and absolute
        <p></p>bewilderment. Her cheeks were turning red. Apparently, she had gotten the wrong
        <p></p>impression after all.
        <p></p>"…So you also depend on me, Amane?"
        <p></p>"You're, like, the only thing holding me up, in more ways than one."
        <p></p>"When you say it that way, it sounds like I'm quite important in your life, you know."
        <p></p>She said it like she was criticizing him, but her tone of voice was gentle. She looked at
        <p></p>him with a gaze that said What a hopeless guy.
        <p></p>Amane was grappling with some very complicated feelings, so he scratched his cheek
        <p></p>and tried to change the subject. "Well anyway, how are you feeling about the new
        <p></p>classes? Are you looking forward to the change?"
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked several times, then relaxed into a smile. "I am looking forward to the
        <p></p>class changes."
        <p></p>"Well, I guess you'll survive no matter which class you end up in, huh?"
        <p></p>"That's true, but I'd rather do more than survive. Wouldn't you?"
        <p></p>"I guess you're right."
        <p></p>Getting along with people on a superficial level didn't mean that Mahiru would
        <p></p>actually be happy. But she was the kind of person who had to maintain a perfect facade
        <p></p>no matter how exhausting that could be.
        <p></p>On the other hand, there was a chance that Mahiru and Chitose would be in the same
        <p></p>class. That would give Mahiru the chance to spend more time with a friend who had
        <p></p>seen her true nature. It seemed like the best outcome.
        <p></p>"Amane, do you know why I'm looking forward to the class changes?"
        <p></p>Amane was startled to see Mahiru wearing a slightly impish smile, and he put a hand
        <p></p>to his mouth as he pondered the question.
        <p></p>"…Because there's a chance you'll be in the same class with Chitose?"
        <p></p>"Okay, well there's that, too… but it's not the right answer, you dummy," she teased.
        <p></p>Amane knew she wasn't trying to insult him, but he could hear a slightly peevish tone
        <p></p>in her words, so he decided he'd better humor her for the time being. He stroked her
        <p></p>hair, careful not to mess it up. "That's me, a big dummy," he said ruefully.
        <p></p>"…You're awfully sly, Amane."
        <p></p>"Wh-what do you mean?"
        <p></p>"It's okay; you don't have to understand. Just… please don't forget about me once the
        <p></p>new semester starts, all right?"
        <p></p>Suddenly, Mahiru shifted, leaning against him with all her weight. He struggled to keep
        <p></p>his heart from leaping out of his chest at her.
        <p></p>…What are you trying to do, Mahiru?
        <p></p>It sounded almost like Mahiru was planning something. Amane suddenly had a bad
        <p></p>feeling about the next week's opening ceremony. He'd been hoping that the coming
        <p></p>semester would be a peaceful one.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 26: You Are Not Alone 
        <p></p>The day before the start of the new semester, Amane was slovenly sprawled out on his
        <p></p>sofa, lazily watching the news on television.
        <p></p>He was feeling carefree despite the upcoming school year, both because the weather
        <p></p>had settled down into the perfect climate for napping, and because no matter what
        <p></p>class he was assigned, he knew his social standing wouldn't change.
        <p></p>Through eyes blurry from yawning, he stared at the TV, where a serious-looking
        <p></p>announcer was reporting on the best times to see the cherry blossoms. The broadcast
        <p></p>covered where the viewing was currently best, how many people were expected to go
        <p></p>out to see the trees, and which regions were in full bloom. It all sounded very lively.
        <p></p>Apparently, the region he was living in was close to full bloom, too. According to the
        <p></p>news report, the flowers had blossomed quite early this year. It was a surprise to see
        <p></p>them out before the start of the new semester. It reminded Amane of his hometown,
        <p></p>actually, where they usually bloomed this time of year.
        <p></p>Cherry blossoms, huh…?
        <p></p>Amane had never really cared about the changing of the seasons all that much, but he
        <p></p>could understand why some people found it charming. He did have some fondness for
        <p></p>the cherry blossoms and liked to see the pale petals.
        <p></p>Come to think of it, there was a row of cherry trees not that far from here, near the river…
        <p></p>Amane slowly sat up.
        <p></p>I really loafed around over spring break, huh? I guess I shouldn't be surprised…
        <p></p>Aside from a moderate amount of weight training and some light jogging, he hadn't
        <p></p>gone anywhere or done anything.
        <p></p>Amane had always preferred the indoors, but he'd basically spent the entire holiday
        <p></p>sitting in his apartment with Mahiru, so he figured it would probably do him some
        <p></p>good to go outside for a change.
        <p></p>He was annoyed that it had taken a news report to get him moving, but today was the
        <p></p>last day of spring break, so if he didn't seize this opportunity, he would have to wait a
        <p></p>whole week. Really, he had no choice but to just go for it—no time like the present,
        <p></p>after all.
        <p></p>Amane rolled off the sofa and changed into appropriate street clothes. He was going
        <p></p>alone, so he didn't bother getting into mystery man mode.
        <p></p>Since he was just one lone guy, getting ready was simple. After he changed, he grabbed
        <p></p>his bag, stuck his phone and wallet inside, then prepared to leave.
        <p></p>Just as Amane opened the door, a ripple of golden hair filled his vision.
        <p></p>"Oh, Amane, where are you going?"
        <p></p>Mahiru was in her usual clothes, so she was probably actually just on her way over to
        <p></p>his place. It would be pretty awkward to set off now.
        <p></p>"Mahiru? Oh, I thought I would go for a bit of a walk. It's the last day of spring break,
        <p></p>you know. Today's it."
        <p></p>"I see. You were kind of a hermit over the break, weren't you?"
        <p></p>"Oh, hush… A-anyway, I won't be back for a couple hours, so if you want to chill at my
        <p></p>place, that's fine. What are you up to?"
        <p></p>Amane thought that his apartment had more entertainment options, so she might
        <p></p>appreciate that, but on the other hand, she would probably feel more comfortable in
        <p></p>her own home, so… he decided to leave it up to her.
        <p></p>Mahiru was staring silently up at him. Her eyes suggested that she might have
        <p></p>something to say.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure what he was supposed to do. Nervously, he scratched his cheek.
        <p></p>"Wh-what's up? You look like you want to come with me or something."
        <p></p>Amane had been about to play it off like a joke when Mahiru suddenly nodded.
        <p></p>"…I do."
        <p></p>"Eh?!"
        <p></p>A shrill, strangled sound spilled out from Amane's throat.
        <p></p>"But if you don't want me to…," Mahiru muttered, "that's fine, too, I guess."
        <p></p>"I-it's not that I don't you want to… It's just… How can I put this? If someone sees us
        <p></p>together, the rumors will start up again. Aren't you worried?"
        <p></p>"Rumors are rumors. People are free to think whatever they want."
        <p></p>"G-got it," Amane replied, caught off guard by Mahiru's sudden boldness. "Well, you
        <p></p>probably want to go get ready, so how about we leave in an hour?"
        <p></p>Mahiru was wearing her normal, casual clothes. She looked great just like that, but
        <p></p>Amane figured that, being a girl, she would probably want time to change. Plus, he
        <p></p>decided he ought to go make himself look presentable if he was going to be walking
        <p></p>beside her. Otherwise, he would end up causing her double the trouble.
        <p></p>I'd better do something about my hair, he thought as he touched his bangs.
        <p></p>Mahiru frowned, maybe because she had realized the real reason he wanted to delay
        <p></p>their departure. "Sorry to make you go through all that trouble for my sake…"
        <p></p>"Eh, don't worry about it. Besides, it'll be a good change of pace to take a walk. And I
        <p></p>think the scenery will look nicer if you're walking with me."
        <p></p>It wouldn't really take too much effort to clean himself up, and it was worth it to spend
        <p></p>time with Mahiru. He thought that she would look even more lovely than the cherry
        <p></p>blossoms. Having a beauty like that beside him would make it all worth it, so he didn't
        <p></p>begrudge her the extra effort.
        <p></p>"All right then, so I'll see you in bit?"
        <p></p>"O-okay."
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed quite reticent, but Amane just gave her a pat on the head and then
        <p></p>ducked back into his apartment to change and work on his hairdo.
        <p></p>Both of them were finished getting ready after about an hour, so Amane and Mahiru
        <p></p>set off on a leisurely walk.
        <p></p>Mahiru was dressed for spring. Her white dress was adorned with lace, and she wore
        <p></p>a light-pink cardigan on top. The dress came to just above her knees, which was a little
        <p></p>short for Mahiru, but she had on stockings, so her legs were still covered. She had even
        <p></p>gone to the trouble of braiding her hair into a half-up style. For such a simple outing,
        <p></p>she had certainly taken the time to compose herself, and Amane couldn't help but
        <p></p>marvel at the beauty walking beside him.
        <p></p>"Is something the matter?"
        <p></p>"Oh, you just look very stylish today, as usual."
        <p></p>"…Thank you."
        <p></p>Mahiru's cheeks flushed slightly, and she turned away, looking every bit the innocent
        <p></p>young damsel.
        <p></p>Owing to her striking appearance, Amane could feel eyes on them as they walked
        <p></p>down the road. Mahiru didn't seem bothered by the attention, but when she looked up
        <p></p>at him, he noticed that she was still slightly flustered. "S-so, did you have a destination
        <p></p>in mind?"
        <p></p>"Well, I thought we might go down to the river and check out the cherry blossoms. I
        <p></p>heard they've bloomed earlier than usual this year, and right now is the best time to
        <p></p>see them."
        <p></p>"…Oh really?"
        <p></p>"So I thought I'd go take a look. Does that sound okay?"
        <p></p>"O-of course. I'm following you."
        <p></p>He felt sort of awkward, but when she gripped his sleeve tightly, all trivial thoughts
        <p></p>vanished from his mind.
        <p></p>Her innocent gesture and endearing gaze made his heart leap suddenly in his chest
        <p></p>and his breath catch in his throat.
        <p></p>…This is really a problem. She's way too cute.
        <p></p>Obviously, Mahiru was quite beautiful, but since he'd gotten to know her, Amane had
        <p></p>only grown more infatuated. And when she touched him like that, it only intensified
        <p></p>his feelings.
        <p></p>Amane brushed her delicate hand off of his sleeve and clasped his own hand around
        <p></p>it, struggling to keep his excitement in check.
        <p></p>"Come on, let's go."
        <p></p>"Y-yeah."
        <p></p>It was spring break, so there were a lot of people out. As they held hands so they
        <p></p>wouldn't lose each other, Mahiru lowered her gaze bashfully, and Amane squeezed
        <p></p>tightly and tried to keep his cool.
        <p></p>When they arrived at the riverside not far from their apartment complex, the place
        <p></p>was crowded, just like they had expected. For students, it was the final day of spring
        <p></p>break, and for adults, it was the perfect time for a flower-viewing party. The area
        <p></p>bustled with people sitting on tarps and blankets, enjoying the occasion.
        <p></p>The cherry blossoms were nearly in full bloom, and the pale petals danced before
        <p></p>Amane's eyes.
        <p></p>"…Incredible! It's even better than I expected."
        <p></p>Amane mumbled to himself as he watched the cherry petals flutter in the breeze. He
        <p></p>wasn't particularly interested in flowers, but he appreciated beauty when he saw it,
        <p></p>and the delicate pink petals were undeniably beautiful.
        <p></p>He sighed and glanced over at Mahiru, who was staring wordlessly up at the cherry
        <p></p>trees. The breathtaking colors were reflected in her wide eyes. Amane wondered what
        <p></p>she was thinking.
        <p></p>"Mahiru?"
        <p></p>When he called out to her, she blinked rapidly, then turned to him in surprise. There
        <p></p>was a strange air about her.
        <p></p>"What's up? You looked like you were zoning out."
        <p></p>"…N-nothing," Mahiru answered. "I was just… I was thinking that these really are
        <p></p>cherry trees."
        <p></p>"That's because they are…," he said incredulously. "Did… did something happen? You
        <p></p>looked sort of different, and… I dunno. I was worried."
        <p></p>"No, it's nothing important." Mahiru frowned. "…I just don't like… cherry blossoms…
        <p></p>or spring very much, you know?"
        <p></p>"Ah, sorry, I didn't realize. I guess I shouldn't have invited you."
        <p></p>Amane immediately regretted taking her, but Mahiru slowly shook her head side to side.
        <p></p>"No, I don't mean that I hate the flowers themselves or anything… It's just, when I look
        <p></p>at the cherry blossoms, I'm reminded that I don't have any happy memories of them."
        <p></p>"No happy memories?"
        <p></p>"Yes, because I didn't have anyone to make them with."
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled in a way that only made her look forlorn. She didn't seem upset. Just
        <p></p>sad, like she had come to terms with her loneliness a long time ago. Seeing her like
        <p></p>that put an acrid taste in Amane's mouth.
        <p></p>"Entrance ceremonies… and graduations, too, actually. I was alone for all of them. Miss
        <p></p>Koyuki, the maid, didn't start her shift until the afternoon, and my parents always had
        <p></p>more important things to do. My father would usually at least stop by to say
        <p></p>congratulations or something, but…"
        <p></p>Mahiru's smile was small and bitter, and she looked up at the blossoming cherry trees.
        <p></p>"When everyone else was holding hands with their parents under the cherry trees, I
        <p></p>would walk home alone. And nobody was waiting for me…" Mahiru hung her head. "So
        <p></p>you see, I don't really like spring very much. It reminds me that I don't have anyone.
        <p></p>That probably sounds beyond pitiful…"
        <p></p>When Mahiru had finished, Amane couldn't help giving her hand a little squeeze. He
        <p></p>wanted to remind her that he was still there.
        <p></p>There were many things that he would have liked to say to Mahiru's parents, but right
        <p></p>now he wanted to make sure she knew that she was not alone.
        <p></p>"Well I'm here with you right now. I'm even holding your hand."
        <p></p>He stared into Mahiru's caramel-colored eyes.
        <p></p>She blinked dramatically, and her face twisted into a smile. "I suppose you are…," she
        <p></p>murmured as she squeezed his hand a little tighter.
        <p></p>Amane gave her a reassuring smile, and with his other hand, he reached out and
        <p></p>stroked Mahiru's hair.
        <p></p>"And hey, if that's not enough, I can always call Itsuki and Chitose. And my parents live
        <p></p>pretty far away, but I'm sure if I called them, they would definitely come running…"
        <p></p>"I-it's fine. You don't need to do all that."
        <p></p>"No? All right then. Sounds like you'll just have to settle for me."
        <p></p>"…I'm not settling."
        <p></p>"Oh. Sorry, I—"
        <p></p>"No, that's not what I meant… I was trying to say that it's not settling, being with you."
        <p></p>"O-oh?"
        <p></p>Amane could feel a familiar heat rushing to his cheeks. He still maintained the pretense
        <p></p>that he had no amorous intentions toward Mahiru, but hearing her tell him that she
        <p></p>wanted him to be with her, holding her hand… It filled his stomach with butterflies.
        <p></p>Mahiru's expression softened into a small smile as she squeezed his hand and gazed
        <p></p>bashfully at the falling petals. "…I think I'm starting to like the cherry blossoms, just a
        <p></p>little bit."
        <p></p>Amane gently wrapped her small hand up in his.
        <p></p>"Is that so?
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 27: The Start of the New Semester 
        <p></p>"Listen, I'm not a kid anymore, you know." Amane's exasperation was obvious from the
        <p></p>way he answered his mother's phone call. He was about to attend the school entrance
        <p></p>ceremony that marked the start of his second year of high school, after all.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't decide whether he was more impressed or irritated by her ability to
        <p></p>time her call for the one free moment in his busy morning routine. She worries too
        <p></p>much, he thought as he sank into the sofa.
        <p></p>His mother had gotten used to the idea of him living alone, but she was clearly still
        <p></p>concerned that an old wound of his might have opened again, dredging up memories
        <p></p>of something from his second year of middle school.
        <p></p>As far as Amane was concerned, though the scar ached sometimes, it never bothered
        <p></p>him much. And more importantly, he didn't want to worry his parents.
        <p></p>"I'm fine. Really—I'll be all right on my own."
        <p></p>"You come tell me anytime it gets tough, okay? Oh, even better, you can lean on sweet
        <p></p>Mahiru!"
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah…"
        <p></p>Why is she so hung up on Mahiru and me?
        <p></p>His mother had taken a liking to Mahiru and clearly wanted them to spend more time
        <p></p>together, but Amane felt like it was really none of her business. When it came to
        <p></p>matters of romance, he didn't ask for or want any parental meddling, even if she only
        <p></p>meant well.
        <p></p>Most of all, Amane didn't want his mother to figure out just how fond of Mahiru he
        <p></p>really was, so he opted to kept quiet and didn't engage.
        <p></p>"I bet Mahiru would be very receptive."
        <p></p>"Uh-huh…"
        <p></p>"At any rate, if you're having a rough time, make sure to ask someone for help, okay? It
        <p></p>can be anyone. I still think Mahiru would be just perfect, but—"
        <p></p>"Look, I've gotta go soon, so I'm hanging up. Thanks for worrying about me so early in
        <p></p>the morning."
        <p></p>Amane didn't want his mother speculating about his relationship with Mahiru any
        <p></p>further, so he quickly thanked her and ended the call. He could already imagine her on
        <p></p>the other end of the line, probably pouting in displeasure.
        <p></p>She was concerned about him, but she was worrying way too much.
        <p></p>His scars did ache, but not so much that it would bring him to his knees.
        <p></p>Besides, it wouldn't bother him if he just didn't think about it.
        <p></p>…Better to not reach out if I don't need to.
        <p></p>As long as the people I trust stay with me, everything'll be fine.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't worried about the class changes for the new semester. After all, there
        <p></p>was nothing he could do, so he'd decided to do his best to accept whatever came.
        <p></p>Staring at his own gloomy, melancholic reflection in the darkened screen of his phone,
        <p></p>Amane smiled bleakly.
        <p></p>If Chitose and Itsuki saw me like this, they'd slap me right on the back, he thought as he
        <p></p>stood up from the sofa and left for the first day of school.
        <p></p>Walking to school after two weeks off felt a bit nostalgic. After arriving, Amane
        <p></p>approached the central bulletin board, intending to check the rosters for each class
        <p></p>posted there.
        <p></p>Although he had come a little earlier than usual, it was the start of the new semester,
        <p></p>so plenty of other students were already there—and surprisingly, one of them was his
        <p></p>friend Itsuki, who emerged from the crowd to greet him.
        <p></p>"Yo, what's up, Amane. Looks like you just got here."
        <p></p>"Morning. Is the sky falling or something? I can't believe you got here before I did."
        <p></p>"My dad chased me out of the house," Itsuki replied with a small grin. "He said I should
        <p></p>at least be early for the first day." He shrugged, as if there was nothing interesting
        <p></p>about it.
        <p></p>Itsuki was at odds with his father, as usual. Since meeting Chitose, he didn't seem
        <p></p>inclined to do anything his parents wanted. Itsuki's father stubbornly refused to
        <p></p>approve of his relationship with Chitose, and ever since then, the two of them never
        <p></p>saw eye to eye. Of course, Itsuki's father could be pretty stern, even before his son had
        <p></p>started dating, Amane thought that he was overall an earnest and sensible man—and
        <p></p>a decent parent.
        <p></p>That said, Itsuki's current situation really made Amane appreciate his relationship
        <p></p>with his own parents. They could be more than a little overbearing at times, but on
        <p></p>the whole, they respected their son's wishes, and Amane almost never argued with
        <p></p>them. After all, they had gone to a lot of trouble to send him to school far away from
        <p></p>his hometown. And they never gave him a hard time about who he associated with—
        <p></p>if anything, they fully supported him on that front.
        <p></p>Amane hadn't told his parents about his feelings toward Mahiru, but they were
        <p></p>obviously quite taken with her—even openly mentioning that she'd make a wonderful
        <p></p>daughter-in-law. If by some slim chance he did one day happen to find himself in that
        <p></p>sort of relationship with Mahiru, Amane was sure his parents would approve.
        <p></p>Amane was well aware that he was blessed with a loving family.
        <p></p>…Considering Mahiru's situation, I've seriously got it made, huh?
        <p></p>Amane fell into an uncomfortable silence as he recalled the chilling expression he'd
        <p></p>seen Mahiru's mother brandish, only for Itsuki to flash him a flippant grin. It seemed
        <p></p>like he had already regained his usual cheer.
        <p></p>"Well, my dad's not worth worrying about. Come on, let's check out the class lists."
        <p></p>"From the way you're smiling, I can more or less guess what got posted."
        <p></p>Amane shot Itsuki a weary look when he saw his friend's ordinary smile had become
        <p></p>a devious grin, then searched for his own name among the crowd of students who
        <p></p>were doing the same.
        <p></p>It didn't take him long to spot his name. As he started confirming who his classmates
        <p></p>would be for the year, Itsuki's impish smile began to make more sense.
        <p></p>There were many familiar names on the roll sheet.
        <p></p>Several belonged to students who had been in his class last year—namely, Itsuki and
        <p></p>the boy who was often referred to as the prince, Yuuta Kadowaki.
        <p></p>Amane also spied Chitose's name, which certainly explained Itsuki's good mood.
        <p></p>And there was one more he recognized.
        <p></p>Mahiru Shiina—the name of his next-door neighbor who always looked after him, the
        <p></p>secret object of his affections.
        <p></p>If I didn't know any better, I'd swear somebody planned it all out.
        <p></p>Of course, class assignments were decided by the school administration, meaning
        <p></p>Amane and his friends had no say where they ended up, but he never expected to be
        <p></p>placed with so many familiar faces.
        <p></p>"We got real lucky, didn't we, Amane?"
        <p></p>"I don't know what's so great about it. I guess it's a relief to have you with me."
        <p></p>"What's up, you getting embarrassed for once?"
        <p></p>"Shut it. And if anyone's lucky, it's gotta be you, right? Being in the same class as
        <p></p>Chitose and all."
        <p></p>"I really am, man. I was worried that they'd heartlessly tear us two lovers apart…"
        <p></p>"On second thought, maybe putting some distance between you two would've been
        <p></p>better for everybody."
        <p></p>With this excitable couple around, there wouldn't be a single moment of boredom—
        <p></p>or peace. And their constant displays of affection were almost guaranteed to bother
        <p></p>all the single students.
        <p></p>Amane was happy to be in the same class as his friends Itsuki and Chitose, but on the
        <p></p>other hand, he could already tell that this year was going to be turbulent and difficult.
        <p></p>"Why so harsh? Ah, don't tell me—it's because you're single, right?"
        <p></p>"Try saying that to the other guys. If looks could kill, man."
        <p></p>"I'm joking, I'm joking! But seriously, this turned out pretty great, yeah? You finally get
        <p></p>to be in the same class as the girl you like."
        <p></p>"…Shut up." Amane turned sharply away from Itsuki's teasing.
        <p></p>A cheerful voice interrupted their banter. "I could be wrong, but Fujimiya looks a little
        <p></p>pissed, doesn't he?" There was a quiet laugh. "He'll start to hate you if you tease him
        <p></p>too much, Itsuki."
        <p></p>Amane felt himself frown as he looked up and saw Yuuta, the class prince, standing
        <p></p>beside Itsuki with one hand resting on his shoulder.
        <p></p>It was impossible to miss the flickering glances gathering on him in the hallway. This
        <p></p>level of attention must have been completely normal to him, because he didn't seem
        <p></p>bothered in the slightest. Yuuta was just showing Amane a friendly smile.
        <p></p>"Morning. We're in the same class again this year. Looking forward to it."
        <p></p>It didn't seem like a very significant interaction. He had seen Itsuki and Amane
        <p></p>conversing by the bulletin board and had come over to greet them. Yuuta got along
        <p></p>okay with Itsuki, so that wasn't strange, but it was unusual for him to be so friendly
        <p></p>with Amane.
        <p></p>Amane felt a little uncomfortable talking with such a popular guy. There was nothing
        <p></p>wrong with Yuuta as a person, but Amane disliked attracting too much attention.
        <p></p>Besides, making new friends like this at the beginning of the new semester threatened
        <p></p>to remind him of the past. The pain welling up slowly but steadily from the deep
        <p></p>crevices of his chest was nostalgic. It was a feeling he thought he had buried a long
        <p></p>time ago.
        <p></p>"…Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"Eh? Ah, sorry; I spaced out for a second. Hope we have a good year."
        <p></p>Amane smiled back weakly at Yuuta, who was now frowning slightly, looking worried
        <p></p>for a moment before finally letting his face soften into a relieved smile.
        <p></p>You should save a smile like that for your fangirls, Amane thought briefly. But Yuuta
        <p></p>looked genuinely happy, so Amane was also relieved.
        <p></p>At that point, a couple other boys came over, and Yuuta left to chat with them.
        <p></p>Itsuki, who had been silent until then, had his eyes fixed on Amane, as if he was
        <p></p>forming some conjecture. "Is it just me, or are you on your guard around Yuuta?"
        <p></p>"…No, that's not it. It's just… I was thinking how weird it is for him to try to be friends
        <p></p>with me."
        <p></p>"Really, dude? You're always way too hard on yourself. Look, it's not like Yuuta has
        <p></p>some ulterior motive for being friendly with you, ya know? Not everyone who acts
        <p></p>nice is looking to gain some advantage. You're one cagy guy, Amane."
        <p></p>"I'm sure that's true," Amane replied, "but—" The moment he noticed Itsuki glaring at
        <p></p>him with exasperation, he gulped back down the words he was going to say next. —
        <p></p>But there are people like that out there.
        <p></p>Not that he suspected Yuuta was one of them or anything.
        <p></p>They had only spent the past year as classmates in passing, but even so, Amane knew
        <p></p>that Yuuta was a good guy. With his kind, honest, charming personality, it was hardly
        <p></p>a mystery why the boy was popular, and no wonder he had lots of friends.
        <p></p>Still, this particular time of year brought back many unpleasant memories for Amane,
        <p></p>and it made him extra suspicious, even when he knew there was no reason to be.
        <p></p>"It doesn't really have anything to do with what kind of guy Kadowaki is. I'm just shy,
        <p></p>so I get spooked when someone suddenly wants to talk to me."
        <p></p>"Well, I guess that's fair. You are the shy type. The first time we talked, you got all
        <p></p>wound up like a nervous cat."
        <p></p>"Who're you calling a cat?"
        <p></p>"Tell me I'm wrong. Timid and quiet as could be as long as no one touched you, but the
        <p></p>moment someone made contact, bam, your hackles would be up."
        <p></p>Amane frowned at Itsuki's analogy. As a cat lover, he didn't appreciate his sulky
        <p></p>attitude being lumped in with such adorable, free-spirited creatures.
        <p></p>"Anyway, I think you'd get along with Yuuta if you gave him a chance. Since middle
        <p></p>school, we've been in the same class for three years, so I can vouch for him. He's a good
        <p></p>dude."
        <p></p>"I can tell that just by watching him, but it's my feelings that are the problem. Besides,
        <p></p>I've never really talked with him…"
        <p></p>"I'm pretty sure it won't be long before he changes that himself."
        <p></p>"Wait, why?"
        <p></p>"What do you mean? It's 'cause even Yuuta can tell you're a good guy."
        <p></p>Itsuki said that with another big grin, but Amane frowned reflexively. He simply didn't
        <p></p>understand.
        <p></p>"Mooorniiing! Looks like we're in the same class this year!"
        <p></p>After Amane entered his new classroom, found his assigned seat, and checked that
        <p></p>there were no mistakes in his school paperwork, Chitose approached him, looking like
        <p></p>she'd just gotten out of bed.
        <p></p>This year, both Chitose and Itsuki were in his class, so he knew this was only the first
        <p></p>of many boisterous and heartburn-inducing days.
        <p></p>"Good morning. You didn't come with Itsuki today, huh?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, I overslept. Honestly, I totally forgot about the new semester, and my mom had
        <p></p>to wake me up. Where's Itsuki?"
        <p></p>"He went to the vending machines a minute ago."
        <p></p>"Gotcha. Guess I'll message him and ask for a milk tea. Ah, Mahirun, Mahirun! We're in
        <p></p>the same class this year! I can't wait!"
        <p></p>Waving her hands excitedly, Chitose, who wasn't bashful around anyone, bounded over
        <p></p>to Mahiru, who had just entered the classroom. Mahiru, surrounded by a slew of boys
        <p></p>and girls, blinked in surprise. Everyone around her stiffened when they heard Chitose
        <p></p>address her so casually, but when Mahiru reacted normally and instantly donned her
        <p></p>angelic smile, it was clear that Chitose was permitted to talk to her that way. That was
        <p></p>when the crowd's mood changed to one of jealousy.
        <p></p>Watching Chitose rush over to Mahiru with so much energy that early in the morning
        <p></p>left Amane feeling equal parts frustration and admiration. When his gaze fell on Mahiru,
        <p></p>their eyes met for a moment, and he thought he saw a flicker of change in her soft
        <p></p>smile. But the next instant, she shifted her gaze back to Chitose with a tender look in
        <p></p>her eyes.
        <p></p>"Mahirun, school lets out early today, so let's go eat crepes on the way home! The crepe
        <p></p>place in front of the station is super tasty!"
        <p></p>"That sounds nice. I'd like to go if you really don't mind."
        <p></p>It might have been Amane's imagination, but he thought he saw her glance in his
        <p></p>direction again. As far as Amane was concerned, she certainly didn't need to get his
        <p></p>permission every time she wanted to go somewhere, and he had no intention of being
        <p></p>a burden who kept her from going out when she wanted. He could always eat fast food
        <p></p>or go to a convenience store for lunch. Mahiru was cultivating a budding friendship,
        <p></p>and Amane was happy for her.
        <p></p>Chitose was very good at connecting with people like that, so he hoped they would
        <p></p>have fun together—and that she would show Mahiru, who didn't typically hang out
        <p></p>with many other people, a good time without wearing her out too much.
        <p></p>Mahiru was probably the one who would benefit most from having Chitose in the same
        <p></p>class. She was already smiling happily, despite Chitose's intensity. Amane felt a smile
        <p></p>of his own slide into place.
        <p></p>The first day of the new semester consisted of an opening ceremony, then selfintroductions and general announcements in the classroom. Once that was all over,
        <p></p>the students were dismissed.
        <p></p>Since school let out before lunchtime, Amane had been planning to eat with Mahiru, but
        <p></p>instead, he bought a boxed lunch from the convenience store he had come to rely on
        <p></p>less and less frequently. After getting home and devouring his basic meal, he sprawled
        <p></p>out lazily on the sofa.
        <p></p>Amane had many acquaintances in his new class, and from what he could tell, most of
        <p></p>the other students were on the calm side, so it seemed like he would be able to manage
        <p></p>one way or another. It was a huge relief to know so many of his classmates. It would
        <p></p>have been depressing to spend a year's worth of classes without even one friend.
        <p></p>Amane had enough self-awareness to understand he had a gloomy disposition, so he
        <p></p>expected it would be quite a hurdle to make new friends and get to know them. He
        <p></p>had a hard time trusting people in general.
        <p></p>While idly thinking about what a feat it was to have befriended Itsuki and lauding his
        <p></p>past self for his foresight, Amane slowly let his eyes slide shut.
        <p></p>Being in an unfamiliar classroom had been a bit taxing. Coupled with post-meal
        <p></p>sleepiness, it meant that Amane drifted off in no time.
        <p></p>For Amane, brushing up against the memories he had sealed away brought a small yet
        <p></p>sharp pain, like grazing a hangnail.
        <p></p>Normally, he was able to forget about them and chase them to the depths of his mind
        <p></p>by focusing on the many good things in his life.
        <p></p>Since meeting Mahiru, he had barely even thought about them anymore, and when the
        <p></p>memories did reappear, they were like bubbles that burst the moment they hit the
        <p></p>surface of the water. Those pinpricks only lingered briefly. The recent, sudden increase
        <p></p>might have been due to the new school year, or maybe it had been triggered when he
        <p></p>learned about Mahiru's past. Or possibly because he'd realized that Itsuki, who had
        <p></p>been his first new friend after everything had happened, was also buddies with Yuuta.
        <p></p>"Let's have a great year."
        <p></p>There had been another boy once who had said that and extended a hand to Amane.
        <p></p>At the time, Amane had been more trusting—and less wary of others. He had always
        <p></p>been surrounded by good people and never learned to recognize when someone
        <p></p>meant to hurt him.
        <p></p>And so he didn't doubt the boy. He didn't doubt any of them.
        <p></p>"—You… from the very start—"
        <p></p>Amane jolted awake, and the words he knew came next faded away.
        <p></p>Through blurry eyes, he could see spring sunlight streaming in through the window,
        <p></p>gently illuminating the dark, familiar apartment.
        <p></p>There was no one there except Amane and no sound other than his own breathing,
        <p></p>which was rougher than usual.
        <p></p>He let out a heavy sigh as he looked at the clock and noted that about an hour had
        <p></p>passed since he'd dozed off. A considerable nap, but Amane still felt completely
        <p></p>exhausted, probably because of his bad dreams.
        <p></p>Given how tired his body and mind felt, he could have easily gone to sleep again, but
        <p></p>he had suddenly lost any inclination to try and rest.
        <p></p>I should at least wash my face and clear my head.
        <p></p>Hoping that a little fresh water might wash away any lingering dregs of melancholy,
        <p></p>Amane headed for the sink.
        <p></p>"…You don't look so good, Amane."
        <p></p>Although he had washed up, the hazy feeling in Amane's chest hadn't cleared up. It had
        <p></p>only receded just enough for him to stow it in the depths of his heart and wait to forget
        <p></p>about it again. He thought he'd managed to wipe any traces of it from his expression
        <p></p>so he wouldn't arouse Mahiru's suspicions, but she was very perceptive and wouldn't
        <p></p>be fooled so easily. She had come by after her outing with Chitose, and when they had
        <p></p>settled down after dinner, she studied Amane's face and questioned him.
        <p></p>"…Are you feeling sick?"
        <p></p>"No, nothing like that… Uh, it's just that… I took a nap, but I had kind of a bad dream, I
        <p></p>guess."
        <p></p>"Oh, you had a nightmare?" She gave him an inquisitive look.
        <p></p>"Mm, sort of." Amane shook his head. "Not a big deal, really. No need to worry." It was
        <p></p>a thin excuse.
        <p></p>Mahiru is sharp. She'll leave it at that if it's clear that's what I want. She's the type to let
        <p></p>up if she knows I don't want to talk right now.
        <p></p>Amane didn't want to shut her out completely, but it was still a sore spot for him, so
        <p></p>he kept her at a bit of a distance. He knew Mahiru wouldn't press the issue.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to have sensed that Amane had no intention of opening up at the
        <p></p>moment, and she was simply staring intently at him with focused caramel-colored
        <p></p>eyes. She clearly wasn't angry, or sad, or troubled. It made him feel a little awkward,
        <p></p>but Mahiru didn't stop staring, as if to say she understood what he was going through.
        <p></p>"What is it?"
        <p></p>"Nothing; just thinking that your hair looks especially soft."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>He had been on his guard, wondering what she was going to say next, so this sudden
        <p></p>non sequitur caught him by surprise. He had been anticipating an interrogation of
        <p></p>some sort, so the mention of his hair left him struggling to respond.
        <p></p>Mahiru was examining Amane's hair with her usual expression.
        <p></p>"Can I touch it?"
        <p></p>"What is this, all of a sudden…? I mean, you can if you like, but—"
        <p></p>"Oh really? In that case, come here."
        <p></p>Mahiru moved to the edge of the sofa and patted her lap.
        <p></p>Amane responded once more with, "Huh?"
        <p></p>He didn't understand.
        <p></p>"Put your head here so I can reach."
        <p></p>"No, no, no."
        <p></p>Mahiru stared quietly at Amane, who shook his head sharply at this incredibly unusual
        <p></p>development. Amane was extremely confused as to why she had suddenly proposed
        <p></p>such a thing. Mahiru, on the other hand, seemed perfectly calm, which only heightened
        <p></p>his confusion.
        <p></p>"Is there something wrong with my lap?"
        <p></p>"N-no, that's not—"
        <p></p>He quickly shook his head when he detected the displeasure in her voice.
        <p></p>The opportunity to rest your head in the lap of the person you like is a rare moment
        <p></p>of exceptional good luck.
        <p></p>But whether he should simply go along and accept the favor was a different question
        <p></p>entirely. No matter how much physical contact they'd had before, laying his head in
        <p></p>her lap was a whole new level of intimacy. There was a good chance he would die of
        <p></p>embarrassment. Their hug the other day had been urgent and for the sake of soothing
        <p></p>and comforting Mahiru, so he hadn't felt too self-conscious then, but this was a whole
        <p></p>other matter.
        <p></p>"It's fine; just get over here already."
        <p></p>"N-no, that's…"
        <p></p>"Amane."
        <p></p>"…Fine."
        <p></p>He had been trying to resist, but his willpower crumbled the moment Mahiru called his
        <p></p>name with a smile. Her latent powers of persuasion revealed themselves once again
        <p></p>as she invitingly smoothed the fabric of her skirt, wiping out all remaining pockets of
        <p></p>resistance.
        <p></p>Thank goodness she's wearing a long skirt, he thought from the bottom of his heart as
        <p></p>he hesitantly went to lie down on the sofa to rest his head in Mahiru's lap. He had his
        <p></p>back to her, looking out over her knees, as he felt the firm softness of her thighs.
        <p></p>Her slim legs, lean but still undeniably feminine, supported the weight of his head
        <p></p>perfectly. Her lap was at just the right height, and he could smell her faint, sweet scent
        <p></p>and feel the heat of her body. The last of his willpower dissolved as she brought a hand
        <p></p>down and gently brushed his cheek.
        <p></p>"What would you do if I did something really rude while I was down here?" he muttered
        <p></p>in a brusque voice, making his final attempt to put up a fight.
        <p></p>He heard a quiet laugh.
        <p></p>"I guess I would stand right up and then stomp on you."
        <p></p>"Sorry I asked."
        <p></p>Recently, Mahiru had been a bit more reserved, so hearing her tease him after so long
        <p></p>was almost nostalgic. Amane apologized right away, in case the threat was serious, but
        <p></p>Mahiru was smiling in amusement at Amane's reaction.
        <p></p>"Well, I know you wouldn't do anything like that. You don't seem to have the courage
        <p></p>or the energy."
        <p></p>He had some complicated feelings about being called a coward so casually, but the truth
        <p></p>was that he did not, in fact, have the nerve to try anything because he thought Mahiru
        <p></p>would hate him if he did, so she wasn't exactly wrong.
        <p></p>"Well, why don't you just relax instead? It'll be easier to reach you if you settle down."
        <p></p>Amane didn't have much reason to refuse as she gently ran her white fingers through
        <p></p>his black hair, so he kept his mouth shut.
        <p></p>…She must be worried about me.
        <p></p>This was probably Mahiru's way of cheering him up.
        <p></p>Amane guessed that she realized he was feeling stressed lately and decided to help
        <p></p>him decompress. He wasn't sure why her first thought was that it would be relaxing
        <p></p>for him to lie down on her lap like this, but it was actually surprisingly comfortable, so
        <p></p>he wasn't going to complain. And his heart wasn't pounding as hard as he'd expected,
        <p></p>possibly because he was so worn out.
        <p></p>A pleasant drowsiness washed over him. He had no idea it could feel so nice to have
        <p></p>someone gently comb their fingers through his hair. It had been a long time since he
        <p></p>had been spoiled by someone like this, and he wasn't sure what, if anything, he should
        <p></p>do. He could feel himself sinking gradually into a deep sea of happiness and
        <p></p>contentment. It probably wouldn't be long before he was on the cusp of sleep.
        <p></p>Just as soft slumber was about to completely overtake him, Amane heard Mahiru say,
        <p></p>"Well, doesn't the young gentleman have a single thing to say about what it's like to lay
        <p></p>his head in a young lady's lap?"
        <p></p>His eyes snapped open as he exhaled sharply.
        <p></p>"Ah, well, see—"
        <p></p>"I heard from Chitose that when a boy is tired, if you let him lie down on your lap, it's
        <p></p>like a dream come true and should help him feel better."
        <p></p>Amane now realized he had Chitose's meddling to thank for this unusual bit of intimacy.
        <p></p>Though, he couldn't honestly say she'd been completely off the mark. Actually, he
        <p></p>really ought to thank her.
        <p></p>Amane pursed his lips as he thought about how he should answer Mahiru's question.
        <p></p>While he ruminated, she kept tapping his cheek with her finger.
        <p></p>Frankly, it was the greatest feeling ever, and he wished he could enjoy it every day. But
        <p></p>he was worried if he said that, she would be disgusted or taken aback, so he didn't say
        <p></p>anything at all.
        <p></p>He couldn't be completely honest, but on the other hand, he had to say something nice.
        <p></p>He was being pampered here, so he couldn't lie and claim it wasn't all that special.
        <p></p>However, he could practically envision himself saying something dumb and blunt that
        <p></p>would drive her away.
        <p></p>After puzzling over it for a few moments, Amane decided to respond with some mild
        <p></p>praise.
        <p></p>"…I think it's really great. But don't take that to mean anything weird."
        <p></p>"How can I when it's the first time I've done it?"
        <p></p>Amane couldn't keep his heart from leaping at the words first time. He remembered
        <p></p>that she didn't like getting too close to boys and really avoided most physical contact
        <p></p>altogether. Of course he would be the first.
        <p></p>When he realized how much Mahiru must trust him to let him get so close, Amane felt
        <p></p>his chest and face grow hot. But Mahiru didn't seem to notice and simply kept running
        <p></p>her fingers through his hair with an air of satisfaction.
        <p></p>"Well, it's something I wanted to try, so you just sit back and relax. I'm only petting you
        <p></p>anyway."
        <p></p>"…I guess."
        <p></p>Mahiru emphasized that she was just doing as she pleased, so he didn't need to hold
        <p></p>back or be anxious. Feeling a bit sheepish about it all, Amane decided to take Mahiru
        <p></p>up on her offer.
        <p></p>"…Amane, what do you think of our class this year?"
        <p></p>She had played with his hair in silence for a little while before casually posing the
        <p></p>question.
        <p></p>"Hmm, well, I never thought we'd end up in the same class."
        <p></p>He'd been hoping to have at least one friend in his class, but it hadn't occurred to him
        <p></p>that everyone could end up together.
        <p></p>"Heh-heh. It was fun to see you so stunned."
        <p></p>"Hey… But yeah, it definitely caught me by surprise. I'll have to be vigilant."
        <p></p>"What do you mean?"
        <p></p>"I'll need to keep my distance so I don't speak to you too casually or act overly familiar."
        <p></p>On the one hand, Amane felt relieved that his friends would be nearby, but on the other
        <p></p>hand, since Mahiru was there, he would have to be careful about how they interacted.
        <p></p>He would avoid talking to her whenever he could, but if he slipped up and let on that
        <p></p>they were close, it would probably become a huge spectacle.
        <p></p>In spite of his feelings, he didn't want to be indiscreet about his relationship with
        <p></p>Mahiru at school. As far as Amane was concerned, as long as they could spend time
        <p></p>together at home, that was fine by him. He had no desire to go out of his way to make
        <p></p>enemies out of most of the boys at school.
        <p></p>As long as people didn't know about their relationship, they wouldn't try to talk to
        <p></p>him. He planned on acting like the two of them were strangers. Thinking that surely
        <p></p>Mahiru must understand, he let his eyes close—but she pinched his cheek between
        <p></p>her fingers.
        <p></p>"…What's wrong?"
        <p></p>"…Oh, nothing. I understand your logic, but I couldn't let it slide without doing anything,
        <p></p>so…"
        <p></p>"What's that supposed to mean…?"
        <p></p>She seemed very sulky for some reason, but there was nothing Amane could do. He
        <p></p>surmised that she wanted the two of them to talk like they always did, even at school.
        <p></p>After all, she could relax around him. But she wasn't the one who'd end up in trouble.
        <p></p>If Amane had been a popular and attractive guy—like Itsuki, for example—then maybe
        <p></p>the two of them could hang out whenever and wherever they wanted. But since Amane
        <p></p>was not popular or even sociable, it was a different story entirely.
        <p></p>It wasn't hard to imagine that there might be people who would decide that Amane
        <p></p>wasn't worthy of the angel's attention and hound him.
        <p></p>Amane was accustomed to being alone. What he didn't need was the ire of his classmates.
        <p></p>"…Well, I'll go along with it… for now," Mahiru said eventually.
        <p></p>"I dunno how I feel about that 'for now'…but it's a start."
        <p></p>"We'll still act normal at home, though, right?"
        <p></p>"Of course… But if we're going to act normal, shouldn't I get out of your lap?"
        <p></p>"This doesn't count."
        <p></p>Mahiru announced this strange exception and brushed Amane's hair again. Or rather,
        <p></p>she played with it like she was kneading it. Amane knew that if he said anything more,
        <p></p>Mahiru would pout again, and as long as he kept his mouth shut, he could keep savoring
        <p></p>this blissful moment. It was an easy decision.
        <p></p>Maybe because she was pleased by Amane's silent and docile reception, Mahiru
        <p></p>started arranging his hair more deliberately.
        <p></p>Her movements were gentle and affectionate, as well as a little awkward, but Amane
        <p></p>submitted to the comforting sensation, and it wasn't long before he was utterly at her
        <p></p>mercy.
        <p></p>…I'm really being spoiled…
        <p></p>If she kept this up, he would without a doubt sink into the deepest of slumbers. He felt
        <p></p>his eyes start to drift closed again as he basked in Mahiru's warmth, and another wave
        <p></p>of sleepiness washed over him. Truly, there was no defying the lulling power of the
        <p></p>angel's lap.
        <p></p>He resisted the urge to roll over toward her and burrow into the inviting warmth and
        <p></p>surround himself with her smell. He knew that if he did that, there would be no turning
        <p></p>back, so he deliberately kept his back to her, just barely holding his ground.
        <p></p>As Mahiru continued stroking his head affectionately, he began to feel heavy, and after
        <p></p>another moment of resistance, he finally surrendered to the irresistible comfort.
        <p></p>"…You look sleepy."
        <p></p>He heard her quiet murmur but no longer had the energy to lift his eyelids.
        <p></p>"It's all right; I'll wake you up in a bit. Go ahead and rest."
        <p></p>As he listened to her soft whispers, Amane could no longer stay awake and quickly
        <p></p>yielded to the embrace of the sandman.
        <p></p>When he lifted his heavy eyelids, Amane was looking up at two mountains covered by
        <p></p>a blouse, and beyond that, Mahiru's face, wearing a tender expression. He immediately
        <p></p>sat up, eyes wide with surprise.
        <p></p>Apparently, he had turned over at some point in his sleep to face the ceiling. Because
        <p></p>of that, he had been greeted with a rather bracing view upon waking, and his heart
        <p></p>was thumping strangely.
        <p></p>"…How long was I out for?"
        <p></p>At this question, Mahiru let slip a faint smile.
        <p></p>"About an hour. You look so cute when you're sleeping."
        <p></p>"Don't stare at me, geez."
        <p></p>"You're one to talk."
        <p></p>He had attempted to rebuke Mahiru for her teasing, but she immediately turned the
        <p></p>tables on him. It was true, he had watched Mahiru sleep several times before—and
        <p></p>had gone as far as to touch her face once—so he really didn't have much room to
        <p></p>complain.
        <p></p>"I let you see me with my guard down, so I thought it was time to even the score."
        <p></p>"But you fell asleep all on your own… so… mghnhgh…"
        <p></p>"Oh, so you're talking back to me now?"
        <p></p>She gently pinched both his cheeks.
        <p></p>"Showwy…," Amane meekly apologized, still struggling to talk properly.
        <p></p>"Very well. Good grief."
        <p></p>Apparently satisfied with Amane's apology, Mahiru stopped tugging at his cheeks and
        <p></p>started poking at them instead. In the end, it didn't change the fact that she was
        <p></p>touching his face, but Amane had also pinched her, so this was his just deserts.
        <p></p>His cheeks were less pliable and stretchy than Mahiru's, so he didn't see how pinching
        <p></p>them could be all that much fun. Still, Mahiru kept it up with a happy smile, slowing
        <p></p>tracing a finger down his cheek.
        <p></p>"You look much better now."
        <p></p>"Did I really look that worn out earlier?"
        <p></p>"Not exactly. But I see you every day, so I can tell. I mean, you notice whenever I'm
        <p></p>having a hard time, right, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Guess that's true."
        <p></p>"It's that sort of thing."
        <p></p>Mahiru made this declaration with a blank expression, then traced over Amane's
        <p></p>cheek again and smiled impishly.
        <p></p>"Whenever things get tough, I want you to lean on me, okay? Just like you let me lean
        <p></p>on you."
        <p></p>"…I'll try."
        <p></p>Suddenly, Mahiru pinched him again, gripping his cheeks between her thumbs and
        <p></p>two fingers.
        <p></p>Hoping to save his poor face from further pinch-related damage, he replied in a panic,
        <p></p>"F-fine, I understand!"
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded in satisfaction. "Good."
        <p></p>"…This is coercion, you know."
        <p></p>"Women can be forceful when we need to be. Besides, I never let anyone other than
        <p></p>you see me behave this way, so there's no problem, really."
        <p></p>"Uh, there's plenty of problems."
        <p></p>If anything, that's scarier.
        <p></p>Mahiru had also just admitted that she gave Amane special treatment. But she didn't
        <p></p>seem particularly concerned about the implications of what she just said and simply
        <p></p>smiled when she saw Amane's obvious embarrassment.
        <p></p>"You dummy," Amane muttered, turning away in a weak attempt to hide his chagrin.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 28: Contact with the Prince 
        <p></p>Even though he and Mahiru now had class together, Amane's daily life had hardly
        <p></p>changed at all. He diligently attended school like a good student, ate lunch with Itsuki
        <p></p>in the cafeteria, and went home afterward because he wasn't in a club. He almost never
        <p></p>interacted with Mahiru. Everything was as it should be.
        <p></p>One thing that had changed a little bit was that he'd started talking with Yuuta more
        <p></p>than during their first year.
        <p></p>That said, it wasn't Amane's idea. Rather, Yuuta often approached him, and Amane did
        <p></p>his best to handle the attention despite his obvious confusion.
        <p></p>The day of the opening ceremony, he had felt for an instant that the events of the past
        <p></p>might be repeating, and that had naturally set him on edge. But Yuuta was clearly a
        <p></p>different kind of person than his former friend.
        <p></p>Amane was still slightly on guard, but that didn't mean he wanted to awkwardly keep
        <p></p>Yuuta at arm's length, and as they spent time together, Amane began to recognize that
        <p></p>Yuuta was a cheerful, honest, and compassionate young man. Above all, he had Itsuki's
        <p></p>seal of approval, so Amane didn't think he was someone who demanded his suspicion.
        <p></p>After attending his first week of school as a second-year high school student, Amane
        <p></p>noticed that the pain he had been harboring for so long began to fade.
        <p></p>"Hey, are you cool with this?"
        <p></p>Sitting across from Amane, Itsuki said that as if he had suddenly remembered to ask.
        <p></p>At the moment, they were having lunch in the cafeteria just like they had done since
        <p></p>their first year.
        <p></p>Sometimes Chitose would join them, but today she was off eating with Mahiru. Amane
        <p></p>was glad the two of them got along, even in public.
        <p></p>"Cool with what?"
        <p></p>"I mean: keeping things as they are with you know who."
        <p></p>"There's no need to go out of my way to talk to her at school."
        <p></p>By which I mean, if I speak to her, everyone around us is going to stare and wonder where
        <p></p>I got the nerve.
        <p></p>It wouldn't do for meek, unfashionable Amane to be seen approaching Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Dude, she's just itching to talk to you, and it shows."
        <p></p>"…Yeah, I noticed."
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to be doing her best to ignore Amane, but every now and then she
        <p></p>would slip up and stare over at him glumly.
        <p></p>So far, she'd only done it when nobody else was looking, but Chitose had taken it upon
        <p></p>herself to start giving Amane dirty looks on Mahiru's behalf, so it was becoming harder
        <p></p>and harder to endure.
        <p></p>"You need to transform. There's no other way."
        <p></p>"No way; dressing up like that is a huge pain, and you know I don't like the attention."
        <p></p>Besides, even if the rumors had settled down for the moment, some people had seen
        <p></p>him out and about with Mahiru, even if they hadn't recognized him. If people made the
        <p></p>connection that Amane was the mystery man, things would probably get so hectic it
        <p></p>would derail his whole high school career.
        <p></p>"Why are you like this…? And honestly, you could be so popular."
        <p></p>"That makes no sense."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't imagine changing his hair a little bit and suddenly becoming popular,
        <p></p>but Itsuki seemed convinced for some reason.
        <p></p>"I think you've got the kind of personality that girls want in a boyfriend. You've got a
        <p></p>cynical side, but you're also sincere, and you're the type of guy who treats girls well."
        <p></p>"…Isn't that normal?"
        <p></p>"I think there are a lot of guys who can't even do that much. Like, you're the type who
        <p></p>can figure out what a girl wants and then make it happen. You don't make a big deal
        <p></p>out of it; you just pay attention and then act on what you see."
        <p></p>"…You sound awfully sure about this."
        <p></p>"If you weren't that type of guy, do you really think that a cautious girl who's always
        <p></p>hiding behind a guarded smile would have ever gotten attached to you?"
        <p></p>When he put it that way, Amane couldn't refute his friend's theory.
        <p></p>He bit his lip hard as he mulled it over, and Itsuki laughed.
        <p></p>"…Also, can I say one thing?" his friend continued.
        <p></p>"What?"
        <p></p>"If you weren't into her, you probably wouldn't treat her as well as you do."
        <p></p>"Shut up. Is it so bad being nice to someone?"
        <p></p>Itsuki could read him like a book. There was no hiding how he felt. Amane turned away
        <p></p>and began sulkily slurping up the noodles he'd ordered for lunch.
        <p></p>Rather than teasing him further, Itsuki nodded sagely and acted impressed.
        <p></p>"If you ask me, you oughtta be happy. It's a wonderful thing to find someone to treasure."
        <p></p>"Oh, you think you're an expert?"
        <p></p>"I know I am."
        <p></p>"…I don't really care whether we get together. If there's someone out there who would
        <p></p>make her happy, I don't mind if it's not me."
        <p></p>If Mahiru chose some other, unknown man and was really, truly happy with him, Amane
        <p></p>would give them his blessing. If anyone deserved happiness, it was Mahiru. Of course,
        <p></p>he very much wanted to be the one to make her happy, but if she ended up finding
        <p></p>fulfillment elsewhere, he wouldn't balk at swallowing his feelings.
        <p></p>"…You're such a wuss."
        <p></p>"And you're a jackass… Look, I do want to make her happy, I do, but—"
        <p></p>"Then just tell her that already."
        <p></p>"I can't just come out and say it, you moron!"
        <p></p>How can I confess my feelings if I haven't even figured them out myself?
        <p></p>Mahiru was so cautious when it came to relationships that Amane was sure there was
        <p></p>no way she would be willing to go out with someone for fun or just to try things out.
        <p></p>It was all or nothing.
        <p></p>And given everything with Mahiru's parents, she's not likely to agree to date so easily
        <p></p>anyway.
        <p></p>"…You are a serious late bloomer."
        <p></p>"Shut up. It's fine; I can get her to like me in my own way."
        <p></p>"…Well, as an objective observer, I think it'd be better if you tell her everything straight
        <p></p>up, but—"
        <p></p>"But what?"
        <p></p>"…Nothing," Itsuki muttered. "…All right; good luck. I'm rooting for you."
        <p></p>Amane frowned, but he was actually really grateful for his friend's somewhatexasperated encouragement.
        <p></p>"Oh, Fujimiya, don't see you here often."
        <p></p>Amane had stopped by the local arcade after school. He was just inserting a bill into
        <p></p>the change machine when he heard a familiar voice.
        <p></p>He stuffed his change into his wallet and turned around to find Yuuta standing there.
        <p></p>He had apparently also come to play games and was standing behind Amane with his
        <p></p>wallet in one hand.
        <p></p>"Kadowaki? You're an even rarer sight. What happened to track club?"
        <p></p>"We have a break today. It's not good to work the body too hard day after day."
        <p></p>"Ah."
        <p></p>So the school's top track-and-field star takes a vacation once in a while, too, eh?
        <p></p>Amane stepped back from the machine, and Yuuta inserted his bills and waited for the
        <p></p>change. Once he'd deposited about two thousand yen worth of coins back in his wallet,
        <p></p>Yuuta noticed Amane staring at him and smiled.
        <p></p>"I'm surprised to find you in a place like this, Fujimiya. You don't seem like you would
        <p></p>appreciate the noise much."
        <p></p>"I hit up game centers like everyone else. I just don't like to waste money, so I don't go
        <p></p>that often."
        <p></p>"Hmm. Well, what did you come for today?"
        <p></p>"I wanted to check out the crane games. I got an order to pick up a stuffed animal."
        <p></p>Actually, it was more like Chitose had shown him the NEW ARRIVALS page of the game
        <p></p>center's website and pointed out which ones Mahiru might like, so he had decided to
        <p></p>get one as a present for Mahiru, since she had seemed a little down lately.
        <p></p>Also, as he had seen in the infamous photo Chitose had sent him, Mahiru's apartment
        <p></p>was quite sparse. So he was hoping to win a cute friend for the teddy bear he'd already
        <p></p>gotten her.
        <p></p>"Do you think you can win a stuffed animal?"
        <p></p>"It's kind of my specialty."
        <p></p>The crane arms at this particular arcade were stronger than usual, so it was easy to
        <p></p>pick up the toys. As long as he accounted for the balance and position of the stuffed
        <p></p>animals when controlling the crane, it was surprisingly easy to snag a prize.
        <p></p>It was actually his mother who had taught him how, way back in elementary school.
        <p></p>"This one, you see? If you bring the arm down right here, you can get it no problem. And
        <p></p>this one is good, too. Just hook the tag with the arm."It was one of many pointless talents
        <p></p>that had rubbed off on him.
        <p></p>Yuuta was giving him an incredulous look, so Amane led his classmate over to the
        <p></p>corner crammed with all the crane games. He decided to try his luck on a machine in
        <p></p>the new-arrivals section filled with stuffed rabbits.
        <p></p>Amane casually put a coin in the slot. Judging by the placement of the stuffed animals
        <p></p>and the size of the crane arm, a single coin would be enough. Some prizes took a lot of
        <p></p>money to win, but one of these stuffed rabbits—a character Amane didn't recognize—
        <p></p>should be easy.
        <p></p>He aimed the crane at the place where the rabbit's head and body met and skillfully
        <p></p>guided the arm into place, catching the head and avoiding the body. As the crane came
        <p></p>back up, it brought the prize with it, secured by the head. When he took his hand off
        <p></p>the lever, the stuffed rabbit tumbled down the prize shoot with a plop.
        <p></p>Amane casually pulled it out and turned to show Yuuta, who looked impressed.
        <p></p>"Wow!"
        <p></p>"The crane arms at this game center are strong, and the staff are friendly, so if you get
        <p></p>stuck, they'll show you how to win. It's a good place for beginners, too."
        <p></p>"So that's why Itsuki and the others said this place would be good? I see now." Yuuta
        <p></p>nodded. "By the way, is that a gift for someone in particular?"
        <p></p>"Yeah. Someone who takes good care of me. I want to show my appreciation."
        <p></p>Well, it's not a lie.
        <p></p>I just conveniently left out the fact that I'm talking about Mahiru. It's true she takes care
        <p></p>of me, and I am grateful for what she does every day.
        <p></p>He also quite simply thought Mahiru would look adorable surrounded by stuffed
        <p></p>animals, so his choice of gift was not entirely innocent.
        <p></p>"You're a really thoughtful guy, Fujimiya. But I knew that already."
        <p></p>"What do you mean, you knew that?"
        <p></p>"Well, you're sensitive, and you always act like a gentleman. Plus, you help people out
        <p></p>without making a big deal of it."
        <p></p>"Sometimes, I guess."
        <p></p>"Even if it's only sometimes, you helped me. Like with the bags and stuff, that was a
        <p></p>big help." Yuuta thanked him again with a bright smile, and Amane felt slightly
        <p></p>embarrassed.
        <p></p>It really wasn't a big deal, but apparently Yuuta still remembered it.
        <p></p>Amane usually had shopping bags on hand anyway, and it hadn't been his intention to
        <p></p>make Yuuta feel indebted to him.
        <p></p>"…Oh yeah, did you eat all that Valentine's chocolate, Kadowaki?" Amane asked, trying
        <p></p>to move past the awkwardness he felt when confronted with Yuuta's overflowing
        <p></p>gratitude.
        <p></p>Yuuta's expression grew cloudy. "Ah… Can you keep a secret? I only ate the storebought ones."
        <p></p>"You didn't eat the handmade ones?"
        <p></p>"…The handmade chocolates are… How do I put this? I'm sure there are some girls
        <p></p>who can make them well, but—"
        <p></p>"They're bad?"
        <p></p>"No, it's just… Sometimes they have hairs in them or other things that clearly shouldn't
        <p></p>be in there."
        <p></p>"Are we still talking about chocolate…?"
        <p></p>Finding out that something like that had accidentally gotten mixed in would have been
        <p></p>bad enough, but from hearing his voice, Amane suspected that Yuuta had discovered
        <p></p>intentional adulterations on more than one occasion.
        <p></p>He remembered reading somewhere that, long ago, people had believed mixing a part
        <p></p>of the body into someone's food could work like a magic charm to make them fall in
        <p></p>love. The person who consumed the secret ingredient was supposed to be helpless to
        <p></p>resist the effects.
        <p></p>"I accept the gifts, even if they've got… stuff in them, but… that used to happen a lot,
        <p></p>and I'm still afraid it might happen again, so I tell everyone ahead of time that I won't
        <p></p>eat any handmade chocolates. The ones who give them to me anyway… Well, I appreciate
        <p></p>the thought behind the present, and I do still pay back every gift. Unfortunately, some
        <p></p>of them try to disguise it as store-bought chocolate, but… What can you do? And of
        <p></p>course, if it happens more than once, I never accept chocolate from that girl again,
        <p></p>so…" Yuuta trailed off, looking sad and lost. Amane couldn't help but feel bad for him.
        <p></p>"…I guess even popular guys have it rough."
        <p></p>"Meanwhile, everybody is so jealous of me, I feel like I can't complain, but… It's not
        <p></p>like I want to be popular. Honestly, it's miserable. I'd give it all up if I could."
        <p></p>"Sounds serious." Amane nodded.
        <p></p>"I mean, yeah, it's disturbing. Girls give me sweets or food with weird stuff hidden in
        <p></p>it, smiling the whole time."
        <p></p>It was only reasonable to be apprehensive.
        <p></p>Ordinarily, most boys would treasure a girl's handmade food, but for Yuuta it was a
        <p></p>potential threat. Going through something so awful so many times must have been
        <p></p>terrible.
        <p></p>"Sometimes I think it would be easier if I went out with someone, so the other girls
        <p></p>would stop flirting with me… but I'm afraid whoever I picked would end up getting
        <p></p>bullied."
        <p></p>"…Jealousy's a scary thing."
        <p></p>"Yeah…"
        <p></p>Yuuta's shoulders slumped like he was at a complete loss. He seemed exhausted.
        <p></p>Amane won a large bag of potato sticks from a nearby machine and offered them to
        <p></p>the sad boy in front of him.
        <p></p>"Eat these; you'll feel better," he said. "And you know, if you ever want to talk or
        <p></p>something, you can come to Itsuki or me."
        <p></p>"It's just hard sometimes… So I appreciate it."
        <p></p>Seeing Yuuta so troubled, it occurred to Amane that popularity didn't always make
        <p></p>people's lives easier or better.
        <p></p>When Amane got home, Mahiru heard him entering and came to the door to greet him.
        <p></p>She was wearing her apron and had her hair up in a bun. She always tied it back when
        <p></p>she was cooking, but this time she had added a braid as a cute flourish that accentuated
        <p></p>her practical style.
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled, a little relieved now that Amane had returned. Apparently, she had
        <p></p>already finished making dinner.
        <p></p>After leaving the arcade, Amane had gone to a cafe with Yuuta to listen to him complain
        <p></p>over coffee. He had let Mahiru know he would be late, but evidently she had still
        <p></p>worried.
        <p></p>"Welcome home, Amane… What's in the bag?"
        <p></p>"I stopped by the arcade and got some prizes."
        <p></p>The huge bag was crammed full of all the things he'd won, including the stuffed rabbit.
        <p></p>It was obvious just by looking that there was a lot inside.
        <p></p>"…That's quite the haul."
        <p></p>"And I only used about two days' worth of lunch money."
        <p></p>"Wow, what did you win?"
        <p></p>"Maybe we can save that for later? I'm starving."
        <p></p>Amane wanted to find the right moment to present her with the rabbit. Her surprise
        <p></p>would be worth the wait.
        <p></p>Besides, his stomach was growling. He wasn't lying when he said he wanted to enjoy
        <p></p>some of Mahiru's delicious cooking.
        <p></p>"In that case, go change and wash your hands—and don't forget to gargle. While you
        <p></p>do, I'll set the table."
        <p></p>"Roger, roger."
        <p></p>He didn't really need the reminders, but it still made him happy to hear her concern
        <p></p>for him. She was maybe even acting a little maternal, but he didn't say that out loud
        <p></p>and instead headed to the bathroom as instructed.
        <p></p>"…So what did you bring back that needed such a large bag?"
        <p></p>The prizes must have been on Mahiru's mind. After dinner, she glanced over at the bag
        <p></p>sitting beside the sofa and asked about it again.
        <p></p>"Hmm? Stuffed animals."
        <p></p>Amane had no intention of hiding it, so he picked up the bag and set it on his lap, then
        <p></p>peeled off the tape keeping it closed.
        <p></p>"Stuffed animals?"
        <p></p>"You like them, right, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Y-yeah, I do, but—"
        <p></p>"I saw a few I thought you might like, so I got them for you. Here."
        <p></p>The best prize among the day's winnings had to be the stuffed bunny that was about
        <p></p>the same size as the bear he had given her before. It was pretty large, and he had won
        <p></p>it with only a single coin, so he decided it was all right to feel a little proud.
        <p></p>He pulled out the bunny and set it on Mahiru's knee, where she could get a good view
        <p></p>of its white fur and big round eyes.
        <p></p>He didn't really know anything about the particular mascot. He had simply picked it
        <p></p>out because a bunny seemed like something Mahiru would like.
        <p></p>She stared at the stuffed rabbit sitting on her knee.
        <p></p>"You… don't like rabbits?"
        <p></p>"…It's cute."
        <p></p>"I'm glad."
        <p></p>Mahiru wrapped both arms around the stuffed rabbit and squeezed it tight against her
        <p></p>cheek, just like she always did with her favorite cushion. For a second, Amane thought
        <p></p>about getting out his phone for a picture but ultimately decided against it.
        <p></p>She was smiling softly, so he captured the scene with his mental camera and pulled
        <p></p>another stuffed animal from the densely packed bag.
        <p></p>"There's more. I've got cats and dogs and—"
        <p></p>Thanks to the crane arms at that game center being relatively strong, Amane had been
        <p></p>able to get most of the prizes for very little money, so he had picked up toy after toy,
        <p></p>grabbing any and all he thought Mahiru would like.
        <p></p>As he added a beige-and-white stuffed cat that looked sort of like Mahiru's style and a
        <p></p>plush Shiba Inu dog, she looked at him with bewilderment.
        <p></p>"Uh, um, this many…?"
        <p></p>"I… Uh, I hope they won't be in the way…"
        <p></p>"No, not at all! I don't have any decorations in my apartment, and they're very cute.
        <p></p>I'm happy."
        <p></p>"That's great."
        <p></p>As he had imagined, Mahiru looked adorable surrounded by a small herd of stuffed
        <p></p>animals.
        <p></p>She was still hugging the bunny, but she looked back and forth restlessly between the
        <p></p>cat and dog, wondering which to hug next. Amane couldn't help but smile, and Mahiru
        <p></p>must have noticed him watching her, because her face turned bright red, and she tried
        <p></p>to hide behind the stuffed rabbit.
        <p></p>The contrast between the rabbit's white fur and her blushing cheeks was striking.
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes, peeking out from the gap between the bunny's ears, were a bit teary,
        <p></p>which only made her more adorable. Finally, overcome by embarrassment, she leaned
        <p></p>over and buried her face in Amane's shoulder.
        <p></p>"…Don't grin at me like that."
        <p></p>"I wasn't."
        <p></p>"You were! You were smiling. Laughing at me for being childish."
        <p></p>"That's not why I was smiling. It's because you're cute."
        <p></p>"…So you were smiling after all, weren't you?"
        <p></p>"You got me," he said teasingly, flashing her another big grin. This time, Mahiru slapped
        <p></p>his thigh, so he rubbed her head in an attempt to pacify her for the time being.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to settle down, and when he grinned at her again, he did his best to
        <p></p>make sure she didn't notice.
        <p></p>"…I feel like this is all a trick or something."
        <p></p>"It's only your imagination."
        <p></p>"…Well, just for today, I'll play along," Mahiru muttered disapprovingly. Amane decided
        <p></p>not to point out that she was still smiling.
        <p></p>Looking at the cat that was in Mahiru's lap and the bunny she was holding, he thought
        <p></p>she reminded him a little of both of those animals as he continued stroking her hair.
        <p></p>Mahiru suddenly sat up. Her cheeks were still flushed, but Amane could see a new
        <p></p>tinge of protest in her eyes.
        <p></p>"…I'm always on the receiving end."
        <p></p>Apparently, all the gifts were making her uncomfortable.
        <p></p>"I'm just doing what I want to do, so don't worry about it."
        <p></p>"But… I'm always getting things from you. You give me presents, and you're so
        <p></p>thoughtful, and you spend so much time with me… Everything."
        <p></p>"But those are all things I want to give you, so there's nothing for you to worry about."
        <p></p>It's not like I'm expecting to be paid back or anything. It's just because I want to make her
        <p></p>happy. Maybe that makes it sound like her happiness is my compensation or something,
        <p></p>but the truth is it's all for my own satisfaction. It feels good to make her happy, so I do.
        <p></p>That's all there is to it.
        <p></p>But apparently Mahiru felt guilty. That seemed absurd to Amane, considering all the
        <p></p>trouble she went to for his sake, plus all the care and attention she always gave him.
        <p></p>He honestly didn't think he was anywhere close to balancing the scales.
        <p></p>But it seemed Mahiru felt the opposite.
        <p></p>"I want to give something back," she insisted.
        <p></p>"You're so stubborn…," he teased. "But… I guess if you feel that strongly, there is maybe
        <p></p>one thing I'd like."
        <p></p>"If it's something I can give, name it."
        <p></p>She really seemed like she was ready to do whatever he asked. Of course, he wasn't
        <p></p>going to put her on the spot with anything crazy. But he had to make a request of some
        <p></p>kind, or Mahiru would feel even worse.
        <p></p>"I want a pudding."
        <p></p>And so Amane gladly asked for something he knew Mahiru could handle.
        <p></p>"…A pudding?"
        <p></p>"One with plenty of eggs. I want to eat your homemade version."
        <p></p>"…You don't mean one from the store, right? That's not nearly enough to pay you back."
        <p></p>"Of course not. I'll only be satisfied if you make it yourself."
        <p></p>Amane didn't care for most sweets, but pudding was a different matter.
        <p></p>He liked cream puffs that were made with only pudding or custard-cream filling and
        <p></p>knew that if Mahiru made the pudding by hand, it was sure to be delicious. A sweet
        <p></p>treat skillfully handcrafted by a girl he liked… He couldn't think of anything better.
        <p></p>He made his request very seriously, and Mahiru stared up at him silently for a moment,
        <p></p>then nodded sharply.
        <p></p>"…All right, I'll make some this weekend. A stiff pudding with lots of egg, right?"
        <p></p>"Mm-hmm."
        <p></p>"I'll do my best to make something tasty!"
        <p></p>"Okay, okay, you don't have to get so worked up…"
        <p></p>"If I'm doing it, I'm going to do it right."
        <p></p>"Is that how it is?"
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to be taking this very seriously for some reason. Amane thought that
        <p></p>maybe she didn't need to try so hard, but since he was going to get a delicious pudding
        <p></p>out of it, he couldn't complain.
        <p></p>He stroked her head once more to show his support, and Mahiru looked slightly
        <p></p>bashful and buried the lower part of her face in the back of the bunny's head.
        <p></p>Soft puddings with an abundance of heavy cream were delicious, of course, but for
        <p></p>Amane, the best pudding was a stiff one with plenty of egg, the kind that held its shape
        <p></p>even in the spoon.
        <p></p>The pudding that Mahiru made clearly highlighted the taste of the egg yolks while
        <p></p>carefully balancing the richness of the heavy cream. It had a clean, distinct flavor, and
        <p></p>the touch of the caramel's burnt-sugar bitterness kept the whole thing from being too
        <p></p>sweet.
        <p></p>Amane found himself bringing spoonful after spoonful to his mouth as if in a trance.
        <p></p>Before he knew it, Mahiru's pudding had completely disappeared from his dish.
        <p></p>"Man, that was insanely good."
        <p></p>"I'm really flattered to hear that."
        <p></p>She had brought out the pudding after dinner, and Amane had made short work of it.
        <p></p>One serving hadn't been enough, so he'd asked for seconds.
        <p></p>For a high school boy, Amane didn't have that big of an appetite, but when it came to
        <p></p>Mahiru's homemade desserts, he was not surprised to find that he always had room.
        <p></p>Feeling even more satisfied than expected for how much he ate, Amane felt utterly
        <p></p>content. He rubbed his bulging belly.
        <p></p>"You really can make anything, huh?"
        <p></p>"Well, I had a very… demanding education," Mahiru replied. She was not boasting in
        <p></p>the slightest, but it was true that her culinary repertoire was impressive. Sometimes
        <p></p>she even made dishes Amane had never seen before. They were always good, and he
        <p></p>couldn't get enough of her cooking. Having someone like Mahiru around to make him
        <p></p>delicious food was one of Amane's greatest joys.
        <p></p>"Well, I don't know what else to say, except thank you. I'm very happy."
        <p></p>"…Happy?"
        <p></p>"Sure. I mean, who could be unsatisfied with life when they get to eat tasty stuff like
        <p></p>this day after day? I always look forward to it."
        <p></p>Mahiru's cooking was pretty much what he looked forward to the most every day. As
        <p></p>long as he got to enjoy a meal with her at the end of the day, he could forget all his
        <p></p>woes and troubles.
        <p></p>Just the very fact that she was cooking for him all the time was cause for joy, and he
        <p></p>was flooded with feelings of happiness every time he took a bite, but Mahiru didn't
        <p></p>really seem to understand the value of her own dishes.
        <p></p>Once before, Amane had said that Mahiru's cooking tasted like happiness, but Mahiru
        <p></p>didn't seem to understand. If Amane didn't heap high praise on her, she might never
        <p></p>recognize its value.
        <p></p>Besides, it was good manners to compliment the cook when their dishes were
        <p></p>phenomenal, and he intended to follow through on that.
        <p></p>"…Y-you really think so?"
        <p></p>Mahiru's cheeks flushed slightly at his praise, and she shrunk into herself a little.
        <p></p>"…It makes me happy when you say things like that, Amane."
        <p></p>"Well, if you don't mind that they're coming from me, I'll give you as many compliments
        <p></p>as you like. Maybe you want me to be more specific, instead of just saying that
        <p></p>everything is good? I can do that, no problem."
        <p></p>Rifts between couples often start with forgetting to thank each other, after all.
        <p></p>Not that he and Mahiru were a couple or anything. But she made dinner for him on an
        <p></p>almost daily basis, and he believed it was important to express his gratitude often. And
        <p></p>besides, getting good feedback probably made her feel more motivated, so if she
        <p></p>wanted, he was prepared to present detailed notes.
        <p></p>But Mahiru shook her head, directly rejecting that idea.
        <p></p>"P-please don't… I'd die if you did."
        <p></p>"That's a little extreme, isn't it?"
        <p></p>"I'm being serious. What you do now is already perfect."
        <p></p>"Really? But you're going to keep making food for me, so I want to show you my
        <p></p>appreciation properly. Thank you for everything."
        <p></p>Honestly, these days, Amane's diet entirely depended on Mahiru's cooking, so he felt
        <p></p>like he owed her a lot and wanted to do what he could for her. She was so very
        <p></p>important to him. When Mahiru wasn't around, Amane quickly fell back into his old
        <p></p>hopeless habits, so he hoped she would stay by his side for a long time.
        <p></p>He smiled gratefully, and Mahiru trembled like a phone on vibrate, then quickly stood
        <p></p>up.
        <p></p>"…Stupid Amane…" she said in a cute voice. Then she carried the dishes over to the
        <p></p>sink. Amane followed, his own dishes in hand.
        <p></p>She had moved suddenly, so Amane wanted to get her attention to tell her he'd handle
        <p></p>the cleanup and that she didn't have to do anything else. The moment he lightly caught
        <p></p>hold of Mahiru's arm, she whirled around to face him.
        <p></p>She looked at him with a face much redder than it had been before. She seemed like
        <p></p>she really couldn't stand being there a second longer.
        <p></p>"…I… I'll do the cleanup. You can go hang out on the sofa. Okay?"
        <p></p>He ruffled her hair once and chased her from the kitchen. Groaning softly, Mahiru
        <p></p>rushed for the couch and sank into the cushions. Amane was caught off guard by her
        <p></p>sudden lack of composure.
        <p></p>As he washed the dishes, Amane couldn't get her bashful expression out of his mind.
        <p></p>He switched the tap to cold water, hoping to cool his head off a little.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 29: The Angel and an Unwanted Imposition 
        <p></p>Their classmates often called Mahiru an angel. Based on how gentle and modest she
        <p></p>was, her kind personality, the fact that she was accomplished in both academics and
        <p></p>sports, plus her unparalleled beauty, angel did seem like the appropriate nickname for
        <p></p>her. It was no surprise then that she was very popular.
        <p></p>During her first year of high school, many boys in many classes had confessed their
        <p></p>love for her, and she said that turning them all down was not a point of pride for her,
        <p></p>but an annoyance. She did not appreciate strangers approaching her for dates.
        <p></p>So as popular as Mahiru was, after about half a year of stubbornly refusing every suitor,
        <p></p>she had finally dissuaded the student body. By the time she met Amane, though many
        <p></p>boys were undoubtedly still interested in her, the spate of romantic confessions had
        <p></p>more or less abated.
        <p></p>But that also meant they had not ceased entirely, as Amane came to realize.
        <p></p>"Please go out with me."
        <p></p>It happened after school, when Mahiru had stopped by the library to return a book
        <p></p>before heading home.
        <p></p>The library room wasn't in building one, where their classroom was, but in building
        <p></p>two, meaning she had to walk through a connecting corridor to get there.
        <p></p>Building two was basically full of classrooms, and it was deserted after school let out,
        <p></p>save for the occasional student heading for a club meeting. Accordingly, there was very
        <p></p>little pedestrian traffic, and it was quiet, so the boy's request was perfectly audible.
        <p></p>When Amane heard the voice coming from below him as he walked down the
        <p></p>connecting corridor on the second floor, he tried to step lightly. He wasn't one to stick
        <p></p>his nose in strangers' love affairs. Those were private matters, and he didn't have much
        <p></p>interest in other peoples' romances anyway. So not wanting to eavesdrop, Amane tried
        <p></p>to briskly move along without making any noise.
        <p></p>"I'm so sorry, but I have to turn you down."
        <p></p>However, after hearing a very familiar voice, his body immediately went rigid despite
        <p></p>his best intentions. It was a gentle, soft voice that was usually very pleasant. But it had
        <p></p>an unmistakable edge to it now.
        <p></p>Even though he knew he shouldn't, Amane crept to a nearby window and peeked over
        <p></p>the lip. There on the first floor were Mahiru and a male student who might have been
        <p></p>a classmate. Luckily, neither of them seemed to have noticed him.
        <p></p>The boy had his back to Amane, so his expression wasn't visible, but Mahiru was
        <p></p>looking at her suitor calmly.
        <p></p>The graceful face of the class's angel was contorted into a somewhat apologetic
        <p></p>expression, showing she had no intention of accepting his offer.
        <p></p>"Why—?"
        <p></p>"I don't know you. I'm very sorry, but I cannot return your feelings."
        <p></p>"We can get to know each other once we're going out—"
        <p></p>"I think that dating is something people should do after they've already built a
        <p></p>relationship of mutual trust and affection. I'm not interested in going out with someone
        <p></p>on a whim—a shallow relationship like that would only do a disservice to everyone
        <p></p>involved."
        <p></p>Mahiru had never appreciated shows of affection from boys, especially boys she didn't
        <p></p>really know. And considering her home environment, the thought of dating a stranger
        <p></p>probably made her very uncomfortable. So she was obviously not going to easily agree
        <p></p>to go out with anybody who bothered to ask her.
        <p></p>Mahiru's voice was gentle, but her refusal was firm. There was nothing more to discuss,
        <p></p>so she nodded once and turned to leave, but… the would-be suitor grabbed her hand.
        <p></p>Mahiru's lovely voice came out in a small cry of distress. She turned around, frowning
        <p></p>nervously. "Excuse me. This is not okay." It seemed like she found his grip on her hand
        <p></p>painful.
        <p></p>"Sorry, but I can't just give up."
        <p></p>"I am not going to go out with you. Now please, let me go."
        <p></p>Though she spoke more forcefully this time, and with an undeniably disapproving
        <p></p>expression, Mahiru nevertheless maintained her angelic composure to the very end.
        <p></p>Still, the boy pressed her once more as he continued tugging on her hand. Now Mahiru
        <p></p>looked frightened, afraid of what the boy might do next.
        <p></p>Amane decided he couldn't let this go on any longer. He frowned and leaned out the
        <p></p>half-open window. "I don't think she appreciates you being so forward," he grumbled,
        <p></p>loudly enough for the two of them to hear.
        <p></p>The boy spun around frantically, and Mahiru took advantage of the distraction to slip
        <p></p>out of his grasp and quickly put some distance between the two of them. She must
        <p></p>have recognized Amane's voice, because she looked relieved at the sudden intrusion.
        <p></p>Though she had mostly maintained an impassive expression, Amane could tell that
        <p></p>Mahiru was disgusted and frightened by the boy's selfish actions.
        <p></p>This must really bother her…
        <p></p>Amane glared at her boorish suitor with a mixture of anger and disgust.
        <p></p>Understandably, the other boy's expression stiffened, which Amane took as a sign of a
        <p></p>guilty conscience.
        <p></p>"Sorry, I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but… I just happened to be passing through and
        <p></p>saw you two were having some kind of trouble; that's all. Plus, it sounded like Shiina
        <p></p>was in pain." Amane gestured to Mahiru, who was rubbing her hand where the boy
        <p></p>had grabbed her.
        <p></p>"A-are you really hurt?" the boy asked, looking even more unwell.
        <p></p>"…You were awfully rough when you grabbed me. And anyway, it's wrong to touch a
        <p></p>girl without her permission." Mahiru had regained her composure. Rather than just
        <p></p>angry, her voice was icy cold.
        <p></p>"So she says." Amane nodded. "You should watch it."
        <p></p>The male student bit his lip hard. "Sorry" was all he said before hurrying away.
        <p></p>Relieved that the other boy had finally run off, Amane turned toward Mahiru. She
        <p></p>smiled at him faintly, still defensively clutching her hand to her chest. Seeing that made
        <p></p>his heart ache, and he almost wanted to reach out to her. But they were still in school,
        <p></p>so Amane couldn't carelessly make contact.
        <p></p>Mahiru must have understood that. She bowed sharply and turned to walk away.
        <p></p>Somehow, she looked even more delicate than usual, but all Amane could do was
        <p></p>anxiously watch her go.
        <p></p>"Thanks for earlier."
        <p></p>That was the first thing Mahiru said to Amane once they'd gotten home. She was
        <p></p>wearing a troubled smile.
        <p></p>Mahiru must have been thinking about the incident, too. She sat down on the sofa next
        <p></p>to Amane, looking a little tired, and leaned back on the cushions. Normally, Mahiru sat
        <p></p>up very straight and proper. She must have been feeling a bit worn out.
        <p></p>"Honestly, I was wondering whether I might have overstepped," Amane confessed.
        <p></p>"No, you saved me. He wouldn't let go, even when I asked him to. Everyone knows I've
        <p></p>never accepted a love confession, and most guys seem to understand when I turn them
        <p></p>down, so they give up very quickly—but he was different."
        <p></p>Amane didn't know how many dozens of boys had told her they loved her, but it
        <p></p>sounded like a considerable number. Nonetheless, Mahiru had never accepted a
        <p></p>proposal. It occurred to Amane that if she ever did start dating someone, their time
        <p></p>together would definitely come to an end.
        <p></p>"…You really are popular, huh?"
        <p></p>"Well, I suppose I am. Though it's not something that makes me happy." Typical of
        <p></p>Mahiru to openly acknowledge it as fact and then clearly express her true feelings on
        <p></p>the matter. "I appreciate that they feel affection toward me, but the sheer number of
        <p></p>times this has happened is alarming…"
        <p></p>Mahiru muttered something else in a somewhat apologetic tone about not knowing
        <p></p>how to manage all those expectations, and Amane realized she must have to deal with
        <p></p>this kind of thing a lot.
        <p></p>Amane didn't interact much with Mahiru in school. Whenever he thought about her,
        <p></p>he inevitably looked at her, so he was deliberately trying to limit those incidents
        <p></p>whenever possible. That was partly why he had no idea how often she had to field
        <p></p>these romantic appeals.
        <p></p>"And I'm sure you always graciously and candidly decline, eh?"
        <p></p>"Well, if someone comes to me to earnestly express their feelings, of course I'm going
        <p></p>to hear them out before I turn them away. It would be rude just to ignore them, after
        <p></p>all. Though I don't think all of them are equally serious about their feelings, you know?"
        <p></p>"Oh yeah?"
        <p></p>"Absolutely. There are some boys who confess their feelings knowing that I'll turn
        <p></p>them down, like it's all some kind of twisted game. Others just like the way I look and
        <p></p>want me for a trophy. I have no intention of entertaining something so superficial, of
        <p></p>course."
        <p></p>"I'm surprised there are guys who can muster up the will to confess with such flimsy
        <p></p>reasons."
        <p></p>He had serious doubts about the first group of guys, and when it came to the second
        <p></p>group, well, Amane had always believed that a relationship had to be a serious thing.
        <p></p>If someone was going to confess their love, they ought to really mean it, and he wasn't
        <p></p>even sure he considered such superficial feelings "love" at all.
        <p></p>"Well, I politely send those guys away, just like all the others. I can't accept any of their
        <p></p>proposals on a fundamental level. It's just not possible." Mahiru's voice had turned
        <p></p>cold again.
        <p></p>Amane recalled her reaction the first time she had come into his apartment—and he
        <p></p>had accidentally touched on a sensitive subject—and felt he couldn't say anything
        <p></p>further.
        <p></p>Mahiru was obviously not interested in pursuing frivolous relationships. Amane was
        <p></p>the same way, and he reflected once more on the fact that while his words back then
        <p></p>had been due to a misunderstanding, it was still very rude.
        <p></p>Looking over at Mahiru, he could see that her eyes weren't as cold as they had been
        <p></p>before, and even though he knew that her aggravated, scornful look wasn't meant for
        <p></p>him, he still shrank back a little.
        <p></p>"Anyway, it might be a naive question, but… do people think I'm such a simple person
        <p></p>that I would agree to go out with someone I barely know?"
        <p></p>"No, I don't think that's quite it…"
        <p></p>"Well then, why all the hopeless attempts? It's so strange that they think I might say
        <p></p>yes even though I don't know them. It's just scary being approached by strangers all
        <p></p>the time," Mahiru muttered, clearly troubled by getting so many confessions.
        <p></p>"…Do you think they lose control of themselves because they want you to notice them
        <p></p>or something?"
        <p></p>"So you're saying it's okay for them to grab me or get rough because they can't control
        <p></p>themselves?" Her mood seemed to be getting even worse.
        <p></p>Amane shook his head sharply to dispel any misunderstanding that Mahiru might be
        <p></p>having about what he said. "No, of course not. There's nothing wrong with having
        <p></p>feelings for someone, but it's not right to push them on anyone else or selfishly try to
        <p></p>force their hand. I'm definitely not trying to defend what that guy did. If anything, I'm
        <p></p>angry about it."
        <p></p>Mahiru was very beautiful, and Amane couldn't blame someone for wanting to win
        <p></p>her affection. After all, he had feelings for her himself. But he would never try to force
        <p></p>his feelings on Mahiru. The moment he used them to justify making her uncomfortable
        <p></p>would be the moment he'd gone too far.
        <p></p>This time, at least, Amane had happened to be there to step in. He shuddered to think
        <p></p>about someone grabbing her like that when he wasn't around. While he knew that
        <p></p>Mahiru would not hesitate to defend herself, physically if necessary, it was still an
        <p></p>unpleasant thought.
        <p></p>"…Is that so?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"One hundred percent." Amane replied. "It was awful of him to try to force himself on
        <p></p>you like that… Weren't you scared?"
        <p></p>"I was a little scared, but if he had tried to hurt me at all, I was going to kick him right
        <p></p>in the crotch with all my strength."
        <p></p>Just as he suspected, Mahiru would not have hesitated to retaliate with force. If she
        <p></p>was being threatened, anyone would understand it if she defended herself.
        <p></p>"I think that would have taken care of it," Amane said. "Gotta admit, just thinking about
        <p></p>it makes me a little nervous."
        <p></p>"Not that I would do anything like that to you, Amane."
        <p></p>"Well, I hope I never give you any reason to."
        <p></p>His parents would disown him if he ever tried something like that. And it was against
        <p></p>his own principles to begin with. Forcing oneself on a girl would be a disgrace to all
        <p></p>men.
        <p></p>Amane thought he had made his position on the matter clear, but Mahiru was intently
        <p></p>watching him with a hint of exasperation.
        <p></p>"…Of course you wouldn't. Not Amane, the perfect gentleman."
        <p></p>"Why do I get the feeling that you're angry at me?"
        <p></p>"Oh, no, I'm just complimenting you."
        <p></p>"The look in your eyes doesn't seem very approving."
        <p></p>"Why, you must be imagining things."
        <p></p>Both her tone of voice and the look in her eyes were far from amicable. Rather, she
        <p></p>seemed dissatisfied. What she was saying and the way she was saying it didn't match,
        <p></p>and Amane couldn't figure out what she really meant. His eyes darted nervously around
        <p></p>the room as he squirmed under her gaze. Mahiru smiled slightly, as if to say that his
        <p></p>discomfort was unavoidable.
        <p></p>"Well, when it comes to respecting a girl's space, you're perfect, Amane, but you do
        <p></p>have one weakness, you know?"
        <p></p>"And what might that be…?"
        <p></p>"A weakness to me, am I right?"
        <p></p>Startled by her sudden impish smile, Amane averted his eyes, but Mahiru didn't seem
        <p></p>to notice his discomfort and leaned against him a little bit.
        <p></p>She didn't seem to notice his heart threatening to leap out of his chest, either.
        <p></p>"It might sound a bit presumptuous, but popularity really is its own problem, you
        <p></p>know?" Mahiru muttered in a hoarse voice. She sounded truly troubled. "I'm aware that,
        <p></p>physically at least, I'm more attractive than most people. So things like this happen a
        <p></p>lot, and I'm tired of it."
        <p></p>"…Sounds tough."
        <p></p>"It is. Oh, I'm sure there are some girls who might say it would be a wonderful problem
        <p></p>to have, but honestly, I wish I didn't have to deal with strangers constantly confessing
        <p></p>their love to me and then getting moody when I turn them down, or even worse,
        <p></p>latching on to me or flying into a rage. Even at the best of times, it gets exhausting
        <p></p>having to reject so many advances. And I feel guilty when I turn them down, too, you
        <p></p>know."
        <p></p>Mahiru had no mercy for anyone she decided was her enemy. At the same time, she
        <p></p>was fundamentally a virtuous and sensible girl and generally treated everyone she
        <p></p>met kindly.
        <p></p>"I don't think it's any joking matter to be in danger just by being myself," Mahiru
        <p></p>muttered. "It's not like I worked so hard to improve myself simply to be somebody's
        <p></p>accessory."
        <p></p>Mahiru sighed audibly. She sounded truly fed up and exhausted. Popularity certainly
        <p></p>came with its own set of hardships.
        <p></p>Amane reached out and gently stroked her hair. Mahiru let him do it, passively
        <p></p>accepting the reassuring gesture.
        <p></p>This completely different response to physical contact lay in the relationship of mutual
        <p></p>trust between Mahiru and him. As he patted her on the head, taking care not to entangle
        <p></p>his fingers in her fine hair, Mahiru closed her eyes, seemingly enjoying the moment.
        <p></p>She almost resembled a cat who was letting a trusted companion fawn over her.
        <p></p>"The persona I use at school is one that I chose, but it makes things difficult when
        <p></p>people want to get to know me. I won't let anyone touch me unless I want them to."
        <p></p>As a slightly—no, quite—displeased-looking Mahiru uttered those words, Amane's
        <p></p>hand hesitated. Right now she was letting him touch her, but he couldn't help but
        <p></p>wonder if he was somehow taking advantage of her being upset.
        <p></p>"Why did you stop?"
        <p></p>"Well, I, uh…," Amane stammered. "I suddenly feel a little self-conscious about all those
        <p></p>times I touched you before…"
        <p></p>"If I didn't like it, I would have stopped you the first time, so you can relax."
        <p></p>"G-gotcha."
        <p></p>"You can touch me even more… if you want."
        <p></p>She peered up at Amane and smiled gently, and in her eyes he could see trust and a
        <p></p>glimmer of anticipation.
        <p></p>Amane gulped. "Th-that's, um—" He didn't know how to reply.
        <p></p>"I'm just joking." Mahiru's expression returned to normal, and she giggled. Her gaze
        <p></p>dropped. "But please… keep holding my hand. What happened today was a little
        <p></p>unnerving."
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure how to respond to her quiet words or to the heart-wrenching
        <p></p>distress he could sense welling up inside her, so he just bit his lip and took her hand.
        <p></p>Mahiru's fingers were elegant and dainty. As he traced his fingers over hers, he could
        <p></p>feel that they were soft but strong, with a slight callus where her pen usually rested.
        <p></p>They were not weak in the slightest.
        <p></p>But he also didn't think they were strong enough to fight off a high school boy. Amane
        <p></p>wasn't sure whether she hadn't been trying to shake him off or wasn't able to. Either
        <p></p>way, she had obviously been rattled by what happened.
        <p></p>Amane gently rubbed and massaged her hand, trying to help relax the fear that was
        <p></p>coiled up inside her.
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled, looking a bit better. "It's strange, you know. When you touch me, all I
        <p></p>feel is comfort."
        <p></p>"Part of me wishes you'd retained a bit of that caution you had when we first…"
        <p></p>He looked into Mahiru's eyes, asking silently if it was really all right to let him touch
        <p></p>her like this, and she answered with a beautiful smile.
        <p></p>"Oh, you're not satisfied with our current relationship?"
        <p></p>"It's n-not that I'm not satisfied, but… How do I put this…?"
        <p></p>"If I wasn't all right with it, I wouldn't be hanging around inside your apartment in the
        <p></p>first place, and I wouldn't be letting you touch me. I also never would have allowed
        <p></p>you to rest in my lap."
        <p></p>"You probably shouldn't have let me do that…"
        <p></p>"Even though you thoroughly enjoyed yourself?"
        <p></p>It was hard for Amane to argue that particular point.
        <p></p>He had happily laid his head down on Mahiru's thighs and fallen into a deep sleep, so
        <p></p>his insistence that they not do it again rang a bit hollow. Even if Mahiru had been the
        <p></p>one to propose it, he'd eagerly gone along with the idea in the end.
        <p></p>And so when Amane replied by averting his eyes somewhat and saying "…That was
        <p></p>that, and this is this," he received an amused laugh.
        <p></p>"Ha-ha! Very convenient. I'll have to remember to use that one later. But please… relax,
        <p></p>all right? I'll let you lay your head in my lap anytime you're tired."
        <p></p>"Ah, I think I'll refrain…"
        <p></p>Amane knew if he let himself get accustomed to such a wonderful experience, he'd
        <p></p>never be able to go back to being on his own. He'd become utterly hopeless, even more
        <p></p>than he already was, but with somehow even less ability to resist her.
        <p></p>When Amane gently declined her offer in the interest of preserving what little dignity
        <p></p>he had left, Mahiru smiled pleasantly. "Oh, that's too bad." She didn't seem particularly
        <p></p>disappointed. Amane figured she must have been making fun of him.
        <p></p>"…Don't tease me."
        <p></p>"I'm not. That's how I really feel."
        <p></p>In that case, she's just being mean.
        <p></p>Amane tried squeezing her hand harder to let her know how he felt, but Mahiru just
        <p></p>laughed like he was tickling her, and he had to quickly turn away to hide his obvious
        <p></p>embarrassment.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 30: The Angel’s Decision 
        <p></p>"Itsuki! Fujimiya! Let's eat together!"
        <p></p>It was lunchtime at school, and Amane was on his way to get lunch with Itsuki as usual,
        <p></p>when a voice he had recently gotten used to hearing called out to him.
        <p></p>As expected, it was Yuuta Kadowaki, one hand waving in the air, exuding his bright and
        <p></p>amiable smile as always. Normally, Yuuta ate lunch with other friends, but apparently
        <p></p>today was different, as he approached them, wallet in hand.
        <p></p>Yuuta had been speaking to them more frequently since they started their second year,
        <p></p>but they still weren't especially close or anything.
        <p></p>But thanks to Amane listening to Yuuta's troubles the other day, an affinity had grown
        <p></p>between them, and more importantly, Amane had realized that Yuuta was actually a
        <p></p>pretty nice guy. In fact, he kind of reminded Amane of Itsuki.
        <p></p>"It's fine with me…," Amane said.
        <p></p>"Well, you don't mind, do you, Itsuki?"
        <p></p>"Why do you assume I won't mind? I mean, I won't, but…"
        <p></p>"Then it's all good, right?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, it's cool. Like, this guy here might have been sorta suspicious of you for no good
        <p></p>reason, but he warmed up to you pretty quick. And looks like you've gotten pretty
        <p></p>attached to Amane, too, Yuuta."
        <p></p>"Attached…?" Amane muttered. "He's not a dog."
        <p></p>"But Yuuta is kinda like a dog. He's the type where, once you win his trust, he'll always
        <p></p>stay close by, wagging his tail off. He's like… What's the breed…? Like a golden retriever."
        <p></p>"You guys shouldn't call people dogs right to their faces," Yuuta scolded.
        <p></p>But sure enough, once Amane pictured him as a golden retriever, he couldn't help but
        <p></p>laugh.
        <p></p>Yuuta noticed Amane's shoulders shaking with mirth and made a sour face, but Amane
        <p></p>could tell that the teasing didn't really bother him.
        <p></p>"Don't laugh, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>"Ha-ha, sorry."
        <p></p>"Amane was thinking the same thing, I knew it."
        <p></p>"I mean, it was a pretty accurate description…"
        <p></p>"Oh come on, not you too, Fujimiya. Look here, I only wanted to be your friend because
        <p></p>I thought you were a decent guy, you know?"
        <p></p>"Well, I guess it's a good thing Amane is finally getting a little recognition," Itsuki said.
        <p></p>"Anyway, c'mon, have a seat."
        <p></p>"Geez, who do you think you are?" Amane retorted, slapping Itsuki playfully.
        <p></p>Kadowaki obediently sauntered over, and when he made eye contact with Amane, he
        <p></p>broke into a beaming smile. If he had pointed that smile at any girl, she would have
        <p></p>been out cold.
        <p></p>Amane smiled wryly back. "…Can I ask you something?" he asked.
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"Do you really want to be my friend?" Amane inquired. "I mean, I can't really imagine
        <p></p>what you'd get out of it, you know?" He hadn't intended to say such a thing, but it
        <p></p>slipped out of his mouth before he could stop it.
        <p></p>Yuuta was almost certainly trying to be Amane's friend because he liked him, but
        <p></p>Amane's memories of what had happened in the past might have been clouding his
        <p></p>perception.
        <p></p>Yuuta looked puzzled by Amane's question. "You don't hang out with your friends
        <p></p>because of what you could gain or lose, do you?"
        <p></p>"I guess not, but—"
        <p></p>"Well then, there's your answer. I'm talking to you because I want to get to know you."
        <p></p>Yuuta's smile was like a bright sunny day. Amane squinted at how dazzling it was.
        <p></p>"…Okay," he eventually agreed.
        <p></p>"Yeah, great, I'm glad you're getting along," Itsuki interjected, supplying his thoughts
        <p></p>on the matter with a cheeky grin. Then his gaze quickly shifted to another part of the
        <p></p>classroom.
        <p></p>He was looking at Chitose, who was clinging to Mahiru with a smile, exclaiming,
        <p></p>"You're so sweet and cute, Mahirun, geez!"
        <p></p>Chitose had always been a touchy-feely person, and she didn't seem to care that they
        <p></p>were in class. Everyone was staring, either because they enjoyed seeing two beautiful
        <p></p>girls bonding over some skinship or maybe because they were jealous.
        <p></p>To Amane, it looked like the girls were acting as they always did, but Itsuki grinned as
        <p></p>he watched the two of them joke around.
        <p></p>"Did something happen?"
        <p></p>"Nah, nothing."
        <p></p>Itsuki smiled in amusement and started walking off in the direction of the cafeteria.
        <p></p>Amane and Yuuta followed after him.
        <p></p>After dinner, Amane asked Mahiru "…You're sulking, aren't you?" She had seemed
        <p></p>upset about something lately.
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked dramatically. "…Oh, did it show on my face?" She poked and prodded
        <p></p>at her own cheeks, as if she was just discovering her sour expression.
        <p></p>"Yeah, well, you just look like you're in a bad mood. I've been racking my brain for what
        <p></p>I might have done wrong."
        <p></p>Usually when Mahiru was sulking, it was because Amane had done something. But
        <p></p>today he had barely interacted with her, so he really had no clue what the cause might
        <p></p>be.
        <p></p>"If I did something, I'll apologize, but—"
        <p></p>"N-no, this isn't your fault, Amane. I'm just being narrow-minded."
        <p></p>"If you're narrow-minded, that would mean most people's minds could be measured
        <p></p>in millimeters. Anyway, I'm still not convinced I didn't do something."
        <p></p>There was no way that Mahiru, the girl who basically never got angry, who was always
        <p></p>ready to hear someone out or put herself in another person's shoes, could be narrowminded. Or if she was, then someone like Amane had to be the narrowest.
        <p></p>He wasn't sure why Mahiru was sulking, but he figured there had to be some reason
        <p></p>for it. And Mahiru wasn't the type of person to let a stranger bother her, so nine times
        <p></p>out of ten, if she was sulking, it meant that Amane, the only boy she let her inside her
        <p></p>guard, was at the root of it all.
        <p></p>"…It really isn't your fault, Amane, but… Well, it does have something to do with you…"
        <p></p>"I don't really understand, but if I'm the reason…"
        <p></p>"You shouldn't apologize when you don't understand why. Actually, I'm probably the
        <p></p>one who should apologize to you."
        <p></p>"Now I'm even more confused."
        <p></p>"It's because I'm so narrow-minded."
        <p></p>"Okay, okay, assuming for the sake of argument that you are narrow-minded, what
        <p></p>exactly is bothering you?"
        <p></p>He didn't think that was even slightly accurate, but for the sake of moving the discussion
        <p></p>forward, he agreed to pretend like it was true.
        <p></p>Mahiru refused to look directly at him.
        <p></p>"…I think it's unfair."
        <p></p>"Unfair?"
        <p></p>"Kadowaki."
        <p></p>"What about him?"
        <p></p>"It's not fair that he can go talk to you whenever, just because you're both boys.
        <p></p>Meanwhile, I still have to hold back."
        <p></p>"Hold back?"
        <p></p>"To avoid causing any trouble… to keep from arousing too many suspicions… to
        <p></p>preserve your precious quiet life, we have to act like strangers at school. But… it's
        <p></p>making me lonely, and I'm the only one left out."
        <p></p>She must have been feeling isolated.
        <p></p>At school, Mahiru was still acting like an angel, just as she always had. She gave Amane
        <p></p>the same smile as everyone else and kept him at the same distance she used with all
        <p></p>the other boys. The thoroughness of her act was rather impressive.
        <p></p>But apparently Mahiru wanted to talk to Amane more than usual. She had been
        <p></p>refraining from doing so because it would have all sorts of effects on their school lives,
        <p></p>but now that Yuuta, another popular student who also had problems with the opposite
        <p></p>sex, had made friends with Amane, she was finding her restrictions too limiting.
        <p></p>He hated hearing she was lonely, but he didn't think there was anything they could
        <p></p>really do about that. He frowned, and so did Mahiru. She looked utterly dejected.
        <p></p>"Itsuki and Chitose and Kadowaki—they all get to have fun with you, Amane, but I
        <p></p>alone get left out."
        <p></p>"Argh…"
        <p></p>He couldn't stand hearing her say that with such a sad look on her face.
        <p></p>Amane had always talked to Chitose normally, so he was able to talk to her and Itsuki,
        <p></p>the two people who knew about his friendship with Mahiru, at school like he always
        <p></p>had. But he couldn't talk to Mahiru, so when Chitose came over to talk to Itsuki, that
        <p></p>naturally meant Mahiru was left alone.
        <p></p>She seemed to have some other friends in their class, but she wasn't as open with them
        <p></p>as she was with Chitose, so no matter what, she seemed a little lonely. Of course, she
        <p></p>concealed those roiling emotions behind her angelic smile, but Amane knew her well
        <p></p>enough that her loneliness stood out to him clear as day.
        <p></p>He understood that, and he wished he could do something about it, but of course he
        <p></p>couldn't just nod and say he'd start talking to her whenever she wanted.
        <p></p>"…But, well, it would be strange if the class angel suddenly became good friends with
        <p></p>a boring background character like me, wouldn't it?"
        <p></p>"Why do you always put yourself down like that? It really bothers me." Mahiru frowned
        <p></p>again and angrily jabbed Amane's nose with the tip of her index finger. "I overheard
        <p></p>the three of you talking today, and you should really stop being so self-deprecating. I
        <p></p>wouldn't even bother making friends with you if everything was really so calculated
        <p></p>and cold. Think about what an absolute slob you were when I first met you. Imagine
        <p></p>how you looked from my perspective. What did I have to gain by getting to know you?"
        <p></p>"You're frighteningly persuasive."
        <p></p>Their friendship had started because Mahiru had felt concerned for Amane,
        <p></p>particularly because of his diet. A dash of guilt may have played a part as well. There
        <p></p>was little other reason for the two of them to get to know each other. Looking at it
        <p></p>objectively, their friendship made no sense.
        <p></p>But they had become friends anyway, and it had nothing to do with either of them
        <p></p>weighing risks against rewards—it was because of the way they felt about each other,
        <p></p>feelings that ranged from happiness to guilt to compassion. Those feelings had been
        <p></p>the spark that led them to get to know each other better.
        <p></p>"Of course, now I know you're a kind person with a good personality, so it would be
        <p></p>an easy exercise if someone asked me to outline the merits of being friends with you,
        <p></p>but I don't care about any of that. I like you for you, and I'm sure Kadowaki has his own
        <p></p>reasons, as he said. So it's not good for you to paint yourself in such a negative light.
        <p></p>That insistence of yours is an insult to all the people who care about you."
        <p></p>"…Sorry."
        <p></p>"You don't need to apologize with such a glum face. I just want you to have more selfconfidence."
        <p></p>He still felt a little sting from being poked at, but that pain wasn't a bad thing.
        <p></p>"Anyway, we've got to work on your low self-esteem. You need to be more confident."
        <p></p>"Confident, huh? Well, see…"
        <p></p>"Even better, I'll start spreading the news that you're a great guy."
        <p></p>"If you do that to me, I'll die of shame, and everyone will wonder what you're talking
        <p></p>about."
        <p></p>It would be sure to raise a lot of suspicions if Mahiru suddenly started praising some
        <p></p>random guy that, as far as their peers were concerned, she didn't really know very
        <p></p>well.
        <p></p>"I'll do my best to make sure it doesn't seem unnatural, okay?"
        <p></p>"I guess that means you've decided you're going to talk to me at school?"
        <p></p>"…Look, I don't like being the only one left out. If you don't mind, I want to spend time
        <p></p>with you just like everybody else."
        <p></p>Whether or not she was aware that Amane found it almost impossible to resist the
        <p></p>disheartened face she was making, Mahiru was casting her eyes low and mumbling
        <p></p>sadly in a way that made him feel like he would go mad.
        <p></p>"…It's not that I hate the idea, but if we suddenly start acting all buddy-buddy, people
        <p></p>are going to notice something's up."
        <p></p>"So if I do it gradually, that's all right?"
        <p></p>There was no way he could reject her any longer once he saw her eyes light up and
        <p></p>her depressed expression change, so Amane nodded in assent.
        <p></p>"Just try not to hype me up too much, okay?"
        <p></p>"Fine… If that's what you want, I'll never compliment you ever again."
        <p></p>It hurt to hear her say that, but Amane held his tongue and just gazed off into the
        <p></p>distance. His school life was about to become a bit stormier.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 31: : Contact with the Angel and the Reaction from Others 
        <p></p>After Mahiru declared her intent to have more frequent contact with Amane, she made
        <p></p>good on her promise and began to approach him more often. At first, this amounted
        <p></p>to nothing more than greetings and small talk, so as not to draw undue attention or
        <p></p>give anyone reasons to think he might be more than a friend of a friend. Mahiru was
        <p></p>obviously taking great care to avoid any sudden disruptions to his daily life.
        <p></p>When they discussed their studies, like classmates often did, they didn't get stares of
        <p></p>jealousy—instead, the other students looked at them with admiration. At times like
        <p></p>these, Amane was grateful that studying came easily to him. Honestly, it was difficult
        <p></p>to keep up with Mahiru, since she usually did the whole year's worth of schoolwork in
        <p></p>advance, but Mahiru was kind enough to tailor the discussion to Amane's level of
        <p></p>understanding, so they were able to play the part of ordinary classmates without any
        <p></p>trouble. It also helped that Chitose and Itsuki, and sometimes even Yuuta, were usually
        <p></p>with them.
        <p></p>In the way that all people ease into gradual change, Amane got used to having light
        <p></p>conversations with Mahiru about daily life or their mutual friends or their classes, and
        <p></p>any looks of jealousy that might have been directed at him from other boys faded into
        <p></p>the background. Only the boys in love with Mahiru continued giving him sharp glares.
        <p></p>"Why Fujimiya…?"
        <p></p>Amane was in his seat in the classroom, staring at his textbooks, when he happened
        <p></p>to overhear some boys sitting near him whispering in resentful tones.
        <p></p>Until just a moment ago, Amane had been discussing the previous class's homework
        <p></p>with Mahiru, and apparently the boys had spotted them.
        <p></p>As for why Mahiru had chosen to have that discussion with Amane, it was because
        <p></p>there simply weren't that many people who could keep up with her on that topic.
        <p></p>Chitose, her closest friend, never prepared for class, so there was no way she really
        <p></p>understood everything they were supposed to be learning right now. Chitose's
        <p></p>boyfriend, Itsuki, was the same.
        <p></p>And so when it came to academic topics, it was easier to talk to Amane. He'd always
        <p></p>had an easy time with schoolwork, and now that he had Mahiru's guidance, he'd
        <p></p>become an even better student than before. This was the power of Mahiru the angel.
        <p></p>"What do you mean, why me?" Amane answered loudly. "I happen to be able to follow
        <p></p>along with what she's talking about. It's not like we were having some hot-and-heavy
        <p></p>conversation over here."
        <p></p>When it came to interactions with Mahiru at school, there was some occasional small
        <p></p>talk, but it was mostly about their studies.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to be taking her time approaching him, so no one would suspect
        <p></p>anything, and was careful not to talk about anything normal classmates wouldn't share.
        <p></p>Rather, they had been having conversations befitting exemplary students, serious
        <p></p>conversations that left no room for doubt.
        <p></p>"I guess that's probably true, but…"
        <p></p>"If you've got a problem with it, you guys should get to studying and come join the
        <p></p>discussion," Amane continued. "Having you guys look at me all jealous is a real pain.
        <p></p>Studying is what we're here to do."
        <p></p>"Huh, no way… I don't get that stuff… I already have no idea what you two were even
        <p></p>talking about…"
        <p></p>"Just read the textbook," Amane admonished. "All we're doing is looking ahead of the
        <p></p>material we're learning now. If that's impossible for you, then I don't know what to say
        <p></p>other than give up now."
        <p></p>"That's harsh…"
        <p></p>"Don't blame me for the sorry state of your studies. And anyway, I don't know what
        <p></p>you guys are thinking, but I'm not that close with Shiina."
        <p></p>Amane answered them dispassionately, and the other boys ground their teeth in
        <p></p>frustration. He wasn't particularly good friends with any of them—in fact, he saw
        <p></p>them all as enemies who might discover his relationship with Mahiru—so he felt no
        <p></p>obligation to be overly accommodating.
        <p></p>Mahiru was only starting with light, casual conversation as a way to steadily work up
        <p></p>to being his friend openly at school. That meant they talked about schoolwork a lot,
        <p></p>but even if any of these other boys were on top of their studies, he doubted whether
        <p></p>she would befriend any of them.
        <p></p>Amane did his best to look utterly disinterested, but the two boys who were speaking
        <p></p>to him stared at him suspiciously.
        <p></p>"You… you don't seem bothered by the fact that you and Shiina only talk about school
        <p></p>stuff…"
        <p></p>"Don't you have any interest in the angel, Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"Not in the angel, no."
        <p></p>Amane hadn't fallen for the "angel." That wasn't a lie.
        <p></p>The one he loved wasn't the angel—it was the real Mahiru, the side of her she only let
        <p></p>him see. He loved the Mahiru who could be infuriatingly stubborn and sarcastic but
        <p></p>was also tenderhearted and shy, the one who tended to indulge him, who had a
        <p></p>penchant for feeling lonely, and who sometimes looked so fragile he worried she might
        <p></p>break into a million pieces.
        <p></p>According to Mahiru, the angel persona was like a combat uniform she put on to go
        <p></p>outside, a set of armor she wore to protect her vulnerable interior. And it wasn't as if
        <p></p>he loved the armor. Of course, after all was said and done, that didn't change the fact
        <p></p>that he liked Mahiru, but it was for more than just her public facade.
        <p></p>The two boys now seemed suspicious of how readily Amane had shut that line of
        <p></p>questioning down. He dismissed without hesitation the idea that he was interested in
        <p></p>the angel, and they looked at him in disbelief.
        <p></p>"…You're telling me you don't think she's cute, Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not interested in boys, either. Look, I've got eyes. It's
        <p></p>not that I don't think she's cute—I mean, she's obviously very beautiful, and she has a
        <p></p>good personality. But that doesn't mean I have to fall in love with her or anything."
        <p></p>"Then what do you like, Fujimiya?!"
        <p></p>The boys made a dissatisfied racket, causing their classmates to glance over, which
        <p></p>was slightly awkward.
        <p></p>Leaving aside the fact that he was actually enamored with Mahiru, Amane didn't
        <p></p>understand the reasoning that just because there was a cute, kind, perfect girl around
        <p></p>that he must, as a member of the opposite sex, be in love with her. If that was true,
        <p></p>wouldn't every boy in school be lovestruck?
        <p></p>Just looking around their classroom, it was clear that not every single boy was head
        <p></p>over heels for Mahiru. There were people who appreciated her as one would a piece
        <p></p>of art, and there were plenty of boys who were in love with other girls. Of course, that
        <p></p>didn't change the fact that she was extremely easy to idolize.
        <p></p>"Lemme ask you: What do you guys like about the angel?" Amane muttered with some
        <p></p>exasperation, and the two boys' expressions became lively, as if they were finally
        <p></p>interested.
        <p></p>"She's super cute, and nice to everyone, and so neat and ladylike, and she can do
        <p></p>anything! Wouldn't it just be the greatest to have her as your girlfriend?"
        <p></p>"Huh… right…," Amane mumbled. He knew what they were trying to say, but he gave
        <p></p>them a skeptical glance questioning whether those were reasons enough to love her.
        <p></p>"She really is beautiful, and her figure is ideal, too. Like an angel out of a daydream or
        <p></p>something. I mean, she is an angel, but—"
        <p></p>"It's not just that she's cute and has a good personality; she seriously can do anything
        <p></p>she tries her hand at. Even her figure is extraordinary. Though usually her assets are
        <p></p>hidden under her uniform… But trust me, she looks amazing in her gym clothes.
        <p></p>Insanely impressive."
        <p></p>"That's… crazy all right," Amane muttered.
        <p></p>"I like flat girls like Shirakawa, too, but man, you know, girls with big ones are just the
        <p></p>best. It's every guy's dream."
        <p></p>"You guys are being rude. I think it'd be better if you all shut up now, for everyone's
        <p></p>sake."
        <p></p>Amane was suddenly in a rather unpleasant mood.
        <p></p>He could feel the sharp stares trained in their direction from around the room, and
        <p></p>even though he knew they weren't pointed at him, exactly, it was still enough to make
        <p></p>his blood run cold. Amane didn't have to look to know just who was giving him the
        <p></p>angriest glares. He was not looking forward to dealing with that later.
        <p></p>The last thing Amane wanted was for people to lump him together with these two
        <p></p>louts, so he made a point of turning his attention to his textbook. Letting his eyes glide
        <p></p>over the course material that he had been discussing with Mahiru earlier, he sighed
        <p></p>softly at the two oafs beside him who had begun a particularly vulgar conversation,
        <p></p>even for high school boys.
        <p></p>"…You know, I really don't think that Shiina is even going to take a second look at you
        <p></p>if you keep going on and on about your urges in public."
        <p></p>Amane figured that most girls probably did not appreciate a guy who participated in
        <p></p>that kind of dirty talk. All the more so if they themselves had full figures.
        <p></p>On top of that, he knew that Mahiru did not appreciate it when someone approached
        <p></p>her just because of her physical appearance. In fact, it was likely to put her off if she
        <p></p>suspected they were only interested in her body.
        <p></p>When Amane glanced over at where Mahiru was sitting, he knew the girls must have
        <p></p>heard them, because Mahiru was patting Chitose's arm, trying to calm her friend's
        <p></p>raging bloodlust.
        <p></p>Itsuki sometimes teased Chitose in private, but that was between the two of them. If
        <p></p>some stranger started casually talking about her body, she had every reason to be
        <p></p>furious.
        <p></p>Mahiru's angelic expression never faltered as she comforted her friend, but Amane got
        <p></p>the feeling that she, too, looked angry somehow.
        <p></p>I didn't say anything, though…
        <p></p>In his mind, Amane offered this explanation to Mahiru, then shut out the conversation
        <p></p>of his two annoying male classmates by focusing on his book.
        <p></p>The pair didn't seem to mind all the dirty looks they were getting, and Amane felt no
        <p></p>obligation to step in. Or more accurately, he had already tried to stop them, and they
        <p></p>were continuing nonetheless.
        <p></p>Amane quietly let out another heavy sigh when the boys started talking about how
        <p></p>great the angel was.
        <p></p>The angel is probably only the angel because guys like you act like that.
        <p></p>He didn't voice the thought. The words just rolled around in his mouth and vanished
        <p></p>without ever coming out.
        <p></p>"…Um, Miss Shiina?"
        <p></p>That evening, Mahiru had gone to Amane's apartment as usual, but she was wearing a
        <p></p>stormy expression. She was acting so differently that he unintentionally called her by
        <p></p>her last name.
        <p></p>"What is it?"
        <p></p>Her reply was curt. She was definitely mad about something.
        <p></p>Seeing the fundamentally gentle and tolerant Mahiru so bothered gave Amane a bit of
        <p></p>a stomachache.
        <p></p>"What's got you in a bad mood?"
        <p></p>"I am not in a bad mood."
        <p></p>"…No, you definitely are."
        <p></p>"Am not."
        <p></p>Mahiru was sitting next to him on the sofa, her expression unchanging. It wasn't exactly
        <p></p>obvious that she was angry—more like she was oozing displeasure. It might have been
        <p></p>more accurate to say that the air around her felt prickly.
        <p></p>Amane struggled to think of what might be aggravating her—then he remembered she
        <p></p>had seen him talking to their classmates earlier that day.
        <p></p>"…Ah, maybe you think I joined in with those guys discussing your figure?"
        <p></p>If Mahiru thought that, he could understand why she would be upset. It probably
        <p></p>wasn't very pleasant to picture the person you were sitting with drooling over your
        <p></p>body.
        <p></p>Mahiru had stiffened at Amane's words, so his conjecture had probably been accurate.
        <p></p>"You overheard us, didn't you?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, well, uh… I heard that part of the conversation, but…"
        <p></p>"Sorry. That must have been awful for you to have to hear."
        <p></p>"No, I, um… I'm used to hearing comments about my appearance, and it's not the first
        <p></p>time someone's remarked directly on my figure, so it was more like 'Oh, I see.'"
        <p></p>Mahiru had been conducting herself as the angel for many years, and her statement
        <p></p>was typical of a girl who never failed to put in the effort to maintain her good looks.
        <p></p>However, from the way Mahiru said it, Amane could tell she'd been the victim of
        <p></p>harassment before, and he felt ashamed to belong to the same gender as anyone who
        <p></p>would be so crude.
        <p></p>"Well, I was appalled they had the nerve to say those things in a place with girls around.
        <p></p>I mean, their preferences are their own business, but if they had to get all worked up
        <p></p>like that, you'd think they'd have the decency to at least do it somewhere in private. I
        <p></p>can't even imagine saying those kinds of things in front of all those people."
        <p></p>"One hundred percent."
        <p></p>The boys should have thought about the time and the place, but they clearly hadn't. It
        <p></p>had been inappropriate for them to have a conversation like that where other people
        <p></p>could hear. Actually, as far as Amane was concerned, it was indecent to talk about that
        <p></p>kind of thing at all.
        <p></p>"I noticed you were bothered by what they said, Amane, and I could hear that you
        <p></p>didn't join in. The other girls were impressed, too."
        <p></p>"Th-thank goodness… You know I wouldn't want to get mixed up with that."
        <p></p>"…If anything, it made me a bit worried. Maybe you focus a little too much on always
        <p></p>being a gentleman… and not enough on remembering that you're a man."
        <p></p>"Isn't that a little harsh?"
        <p></p>He felt irritated that his classmates, and even Mahiru, doubted his manliness.
        <p></p>"It's the truth," she said, turning away. She was still giving off hints that she was a little
        <p></p>upset about something, and when she noticed Amane frowning, she hugged a cushion
        <p></p>to her knees. "…Apparently you don't consider me very attractive, which hurts my
        <p></p>confidence."
        <p></p>"And just what, exactly, brought you to that conclusion?"
        <p></p>"You apparently aren't interested, for one."
        <p></p>She must had heard him say he had no interest in the angel.
        <p></p>"Wait, what I said was that I don't have any interest in the angel. The angel is the
        <p></p>character you play at school, right? What I meant was that even though I'm interested
        <p></p>in Mahiru, I don't have much interest in Mahiru masquerading as the angel. I think it
        <p></p>looks like a tough gig; that's all."
        <p></p>"…So you do find me attractive, then?"
        <p></p>"I'd have to be blind to think otherwise. You're incredibly beautiful. As the person most
        <p></p>often by your side, I can assure you of that."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't imagine how anyone could see it any other way. After spending so
        <p></p>much time with Mahiru, he had gotten to know many different facets of her personality
        <p></p>and had come to regard her with great affection. His love for her only increased and
        <p></p>never diminished. That alone was proof that she was appealing.
        <p></p>As Amane spoke, Mahiru began nervously pinching and tugging at the fabric of the
        <p></p>cushion she was clutching. She couldn't seem to look him in the eye.
        <p></p>"I-if that's true, then it's fine, but…"
        <p></p>Mahiru squirmed and nodded like she was hesitating to say something, then buried
        <p></p>her face in the cushion. Her ears were bright red, poking out from beneath her blond
        <p></p>hair, and it was very obvious she was embarrassed.
        <p></p>When she got like this, he knew the only thing to do was give her some space, so
        <p></p>Amane turned away, leaning against the sofa's armrest.
        <p></p>He knew if he didn't cool off, Mahiru would be sure to see it in his face when she
        <p></p>recovered.
        <p></p>…If it embarrasses her so much, she could just not say anything.
        <p></p>As the two of them both considered their words, Amane let out a sigh too quiet for
        <p></p>Mahiru to hear.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 32: The Angel in Cooking Class 
        <p></p>"I'm looking forward to working with you."
        <p></p>Amane was normally never on the receiving end of Mahiru's angelic smile, so when
        <p></p>she turned it on him, it made him want to groan.
        <p></p>"…Same here," he responded in a quiet voice.
        <p></p>As a rule, Amane never approached Mahiru at school, but he didn't have much choice
        <p></p>if she was the one who approached him. But this time, it wasn't Mahiru's fault; instead,
        <p></p>it was simply because they had decided to team up, as friends.
        <p></p>Their home economics class was going to feature a cooking segment in several days,
        <p></p>and the students had been given the freedom to form their own teams, as well as the
        <p></p>right to choose what dishes they were going to prepare. However, they were required
        <p></p>to put together a menu that applied their lessons about nutrition, and they would be
        <p></p>graded on that menu, so they needed to take it seriously.
        <p></p>There were, of course, many potential suitors hoping to be on the same team as
        <p></p>Mahiru, but she formed a pair with her good friend Chitose, and her partner Chitose
        <p></p>pulled in her boyfriend, Itsuki. Amane, who thought he was paired up with Itsuki,
        <p></p>naturally came along with him, so from the outside it looked like he was with Mahiru.
        <p></p>They were getting even more stares now, and Amane could already feel a stomachache
        <p></p>coming on.
        <p></p>Chitose, the main culprit in a sense, was grinning cheekily as she arranged some nearby
        <p></p>desks for them. "Ah-ha-ha! You look like you swallowed a bug, Amane!" she cackled.
        <p></p>"And whose fault do you think that is?" Amane replied.
        <p></p>Once they had pushed four desks together and taken their seats, Mahiru smiled at him
        <p></p>apologetically, letting her angelic expression slip just a bit. "I'm sorry for intruding,"
        <p></p>she said gracefully.
        <p></p>"No, this isn't your fault," Amane insisted. "I'm just worried about whether I'm going
        <p></p>to be stabbed by those daggers in everyone's eyes."
        <p></p>"It's just like Amane not to appreciate his good fortune," Chitose admonished.
        <p></p>"I just don't wanna hog all the good luck, is all."
        <p></p>It was probably just his imagination, but he thought he heard displeased voices quietly
        <p></p>agreeing. All the other boys must have been clamoring for the chance to eat the angel's
        <p></p>handmade food, and he knew they were angry to see it go to a guy who didn't even
        <p></p>seem to want it that badly. He was being pierced by thorny gazes full of jealousy and
        <p></p>envy.
        <p></p>"But you know I'll have a hard time if you're not with me, man," Itsuki added. "Besides,
        <p></p>all the other teams are groups of friends."
        <p></p>"Hmm…" Amane couldn't argue that point.
        <p></p>He wasn't exactly an outcast or anything, but he certainly wasn't popular or charming
        <p></p>enough to insert himself into another group of friends and expect to get along well. It
        <p></p>would have been difficult for Amane alone to leave his group now that they were
        <p></p>assembled.
        <p></p>"Just give up and accept your fate!" Itsuki insisted. "If you're gonna whine so much,
        <p></p>maybe we never should have been friends in the first place!"
        <p></p>"…I don't regret being your friend."
        <p></p>"Oh, I'm getting all choked up!"
        <p></p>"Ugh, you know, maybe I'm starting to regret it after all," Amane shot back.
        <p></p>Itsuki pressed his hands to his face. "A cruel double cross!" he moaned dramatically,
        <p></p>and then he cackled with cheerful laughter.
        <p></p>Amane was not particularly impressed with his friend's performance. He was just
        <p></p>starting to think about pinching Itsuki's cheeks when he heard a quiet laugh mixed
        <p></p>with a sigh.
        <p></p>Mahiru was smiling in amusement.
        <p></p>"I've thought this before, but you two really are good friends, aren't you? It's enough
        <p></p>to make me jealous."
        <p></p>"…I guess."
        <p></p>Even though she already knew they were good friends, Mahiru was acting as if it was
        <p></p>the first time she had ever mentioned it. Amane felt uncomfortable not being able to
        <p></p>respond.
        <p></p>He was grateful she was keeping up the act, but when Mahiru pretended they were
        <p></p>strangers like this, it also made him feel both embarrassed and frustrated.
        <p></p>Chitose had been listening to their exchange, and with a grin, she patted Mahiru on
        <p></p>the shoulder. "Join in if you like, Mahirun!" she said.
        <p></p>"Hey, stop that," Amane scolded. "Don't try to get Shiina involved in your wild antics.
        <p></p>You're bugging her."
        <p></p>"No, that's not the case at all," Mahiru insisted.
        <p></p>"See?"
        <p></p>"Don't get carried away, Chitose."
        <p></p>Chitose liked the idea of getting Amane and Mahiru together. Actually, she more than
        <p></p>endorsed it—whenever she got the chance to steer the conversation, usually she made
        <p></p>every attempt to push them together. That was fine when they were at Amane's
        <p></p>apartment, but they were currently in school, and he wanted to avoid doing anything
        <p></p>that might draw attention.
        <p></p>"All right, enough with that stuff," Amane declared. "We've got to choose our menu."
        <p></p>They only had a limited time to decide on a menu before they would have to present
        <p></p>their choice, so he insisted on making a quick decision in a bid to show the rest of the
        <p></p>class he didn't hold any particular feelings toward Mahiru.
        <p></p>Chitose looked somewhat dumbfounded. "You can't cook, but you're taking charge?"
        <p></p>"Rude," Amane said, bristling. "I can make… omelets."
        <p></p>"…You might call them omelets, but what you make is basically scrambled eggs," Mahiru
        <p></p>whispered quietly so only the three other people in her group could hear, causing
        <p></p>Itsuki and Chitose to burst into a fit of giggles. Amane, still wary about being in public,
        <p></p>shot Mahiru a slightly reproachful glance, but she wasn't bothered by it at all.
        <p></p>Her expression was too much like her usual angelic smile, and Amane turned away
        <p></p>sharply. Chitose and Itsuki grinned once more at his reaction, which was even more
        <p></p>unbearable.
        <p></p>"How about you, Akazawa?" Mahiru asked. "How is your cooking?"
        <p></p>"Me?… Well, it's good enough to keep me alive," he replied.
        <p></p>"Itsuki can do pretty much anything around the house, you know," Chitose added.
        <p></p>Itsuki, who could somehow manage to do most tasks if he put his mind to it, could also
        <p></p>whip up a flawless meal. Naturally, it wasn't as good as Mahiru's cooking, but it was
        <p></p>plenty good enough to survive.
        <p></p>"It's 'cause my mom's never at home, thanks to work. I even used to go over to Amane's
        <p></p>sometimes to make food for him. Don't do that anymore, though, huh?"
        <p></p>Itsuki glanced over at Amane meaningfully, and Amane frowned, but Itsuki just smiled.
        <p></p>"I suppose that's true."
        <p></p>"…If you guys don't shut up, everybody's gonna find out what a loser I am."
        <p></p>"Too late, bro."
        <p></p>"Bit late, isn't it?"
        <p></p>"You guys are way too in sync."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh. Well, now you don't have to worry about meals; isn't that great?"
        <p></p>"…W-wait, I do make some effort!" Amane protested. "Sometimes I make something
        <p></p>when I'm alone…"
        <p></p>He didn't think it was good to leave everything up to Mahiru, so on the weekends or
        <p></p>when Mahiru wasn't around, he did take a stab at cooking. Of course, he stuck to
        <p></p>simple recipes that could be made in the broiler or using the range.
        <p></p>Amane had gotten quite flustered, when for some reason Mahiru smiled at him
        <p></p>affectionately and commended him. "How admirable."
        <p></p>There was a painful amount of meaning hidden in those words. Amane's cheek
        <p></p>twitched.
        <p></p>She was probably teasing him because she was perfectly aware of how much Amane
        <p></p>struggled when it came to cooking. Compared to Mahiru's cooking, his feeble efforts
        <p></p>were comparable to a child's. She was probably amused by how terrible they were.
        <p></p>But he was steadily making improvements—when he started, he couldn't do anything
        <p></p>for himself—and he needed it to be said.
        <p></p>"Well, how about we decide on a menu for now?" Mahiru suggested. "Our grades
        <p></p>depend on it."
        <p></p>Without making any overt reference to Amane's distressed state, Mahiru, still with a
        <p></p>gentle smile, tapped the menu worksheet they needed to turn in to complete the
        <p></p>assignment.
        <p></p>Mahiru was the best cook among them, so the group had quietly agreed to put Mahiru
        <p></p>in charge. Even though Amane had learned to make a few things, he was still an amateur,
        <p></p>especially when it came to creating a nutritionally balanced menu. So it made sense to
        <p></p>follow Mahiru's lead. After all, she chose the menu for dinner practically every night.
        <p></p>After some discussion, the group decided on a sanshoku soborodon, a dish of minced
        <p></p>meat, eggs, and vegetables served over rice, with miso soup and cellophane noodle
        <p></p>salad on the side, plus almond jelly for dessert. Chitose was grinning from ear to ear
        <p></p>at the menu.
        <p></p>Mahiru had casually included an egg dish, probably because she knew Amane liked
        <p></p>them. That fact did not escape Chitose's and Itsuki's notice, and Amane hid behind his
        <p></p>worksheet to avoid their taunting stares.
        <p></p>And then, on the actual day of the cooking class, Amane let out an exhausted sigh.
        <p></p>He was supposedly working as Mahiru's assistant, but really she was just babysitting
        <p></p>him. He stood near Mahiru and watched her put on her apron, a sight he had grown
        <p></p>accustomed to.
        <p></p>"I'm counting on you for support, okay, Fujimiya?" she said with a smile.
        <p></p>This wasn't any scheme of Chitose's. The group had simply decided that Amane was
        <p></p>the least useful when it came to kitchen work. He even had a prior record—he'd cut
        <p></p>his finger right in front of Mahiru—so they had thought it best not to let him handle
        <p></p>anything too involved.
        <p></p>He could understand their reasoning, as all of them were equally intent on avoiding
        <p></p>any bloodshed, and because they wanted to do their work quickly, since the students
        <p></p>would be dismissed to lunch starting with the finished teams, so he didn't argue.
        <p></p>However, he did still take the time to insist, rather loudly, that he "…wasn't exactly
        <p></p>totally incapable."
        <p></p>"…Are you sulking?" Mahiru asked him stealthily once she'd finished preparing the
        <p></p>vegetables.
        <p></p>As he was measuring out the seasonings, without looking at her, Amane replied, "No,
        <p></p>of course not. I just feel like I'm being unfairly judged."
        <p></p>"No one's judging you. It's just, well… um, you can't deny that the rest of us are more
        <p></p>efficient."
        <p></p>"I certainly can't."
        <p></p>It went without saying that Mahiru could cook, and Amane had eaten Itsuki's cooking
        <p></p>before, so he knew Itsuki could handle himself in the kitchen just fine, and as long as
        <p></p>Chitose didn't do anything crazy with the seasonings, she could be expected to perform
        <p></p>reasonably well. Amane wasn't entirely helpless, but he was objectively less capable
        <p></p>than the three of them, so he couldn't really shoot back if they teased him on that point.
        <p></p>"And so I think it's best to get you to work in your area of strength. Also, Chitose's liable
        <p></p>to get carried away with the seasonings, so I think we'd better leave that up to you,
        <p></p>Fujimiya… It's an important job, you know."
        <p></p>"That's a serious responsibility… is what I thought at first, but I just have to follow the
        <p></p>recipe, right?"
        <p></p>"Preventing a Chitose surprise before it happens is also a crucial job."
        <p></p>Mahiru let a giggle slip out, and Amane glanced over at Chitose.
        <p></p>She was simmering rice in a pot while cleaning up after she and Itsuki had prepared
        <p></p>the almond jelly and placed it in the refrigerator. There probably weren't any pranks
        <p></p>in the jelly.
        <p></p>Chitose didn't have an unsophisticated palate, but she did strangely enjoy extreme
        <p></p>flavors and surprises, so Itsuki had been tasked with supervising her to guard against
        <p></p>any of that. Plus, this way she could work alongside her boyfriend.
        <p></p>Laughing quietly, Mahiru pulled out the bean sprouts and carrots that had finished
        <p></p>simmering in their basket, so Amane pulled off two or three sheets of paper towel
        <p></p>from the roll sitting on the counter.
        <p></p>"Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, got it."
        <p></p>Mahiru handed him the boiled vegetables in their basket, so Amane chilled them
        <p></p>slightly and used the paper towels to sponge off some of the moisture, then threw
        <p></p>them into the bowl of seasonings he had prepared in advance, along with the rinsed
        <p></p>cellophane noodles and julienned cucumber and ham.
        <p></p>Recalling Mahiru's welcome words that cooking wasn't such a difficult thing as long
        <p></p>as you measured correctly and paid attention to the instructions, Amane performed
        <p></p>his tasks according to the recipe. The chef had left him with the simplest jobs, so there
        <p></p>wasn't exactly a ton to be proud of, though.
        <p></p>"After I stir in the sesame seeds, I can put this in the refrigerator, right?" he asked.
        <p></p>"That's right, and then…"
        <p></p>"Put the noodles in and take the minced meat out."
        <p></p>The simmering rice was almost ready, so he figured she was planning to get the bowls
        <p></p>out before too long.
        <p></p>Mahiru watched as he covered the bowl containing the noodle salad with plastic wrap
        <p></p>and wrote their team number on it. Apparently, he'd done it right, as she started to
        <p></p>ready the frying pan without making any corrections.
        <p></p>The vegetables for the miso soup were already done cooking, and they just needed to
        <p></p>dissolve the miso paste. Chitose and Itsuki had put the almond jelly in the refrigerator
        <p></p>to chill and congeal, so all that was left was to get the rice bowls ready.
        <p></p>Taking care not to bump anyone on the way, Amane exchanged minced meat for
        <p></p>noodle salad in the fridge and returned to their station.
        <p></p>As he was walking back to his own group's station, he took a sidelong glance at the
        <p></p>other teams. Some were doing all right, while others were bickering. One of the teams
        <p></p>made up of all boys was playing around and wasting ingredients, and the teacher who
        <p></p>was overseeing this exercise in student autonomy was glaring sharply at them.
        <p></p>…Seeing that makes me glad I have Mahiru with me.
        <p></p>The fact that Amane's team had been able to do their work more smoothly than other
        <p></p>teams was thanks to Mahiru's great familiarity with the cooking process and also
        <p></p>because they'd chosen a menu that wasn't too demanding.
        <p></p>"Rather than showing off with some complicated menu, it'll be easier to make a meal
        <p></p>that's nutritious and doesn't take too much time. Food is something you have to make
        <p></p>every day, so you shouldn't fixate on things that tire you out, right?"
        <p></p>Amane had asked her at home about her reasoning for the menu, and that's how she
        <p></p>had answered. He thought it was a rational way of thinking, typical of Mahiru, who
        <p></p>made dinner for the two of them every night.
        <p></p>From Amane's perspective, even this simple menu took plenty of work to get right, so
        <p></p>this cooking class was bringing him a renewed appreciation of Mahiru's worth.
        <p></p>Musing seriously to himself that the people in charge of the kitchens of the world must
        <p></p>have a hard time making every meal, he returned to their counter, where Mahiru was
        <p></p>giving Chitose instructions. Itsuki was nowhere to be seen, but Mahiru must have
        <p></p>understood his unspoken question from the look in his eyes, because she promptly
        <p></p>informed him, "I asked Akazawa to go fetch the dishes from the other room." She
        <p></p>continued, "All right then, I'm entrusting the meat to you."
        <p></p>"Got it," Amane replied. "Cook it until the juice dries up, right?"
        <p></p>"That's right. Thanks."
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to be working on the yellow and green portions of the tricolor rice
        <p></p>bowl. She boiled water to parboil the spinach as she cracked and scrambled the eggs.
        <p></p>Mahiru had finished preparing the frying pan for use, leaving Amane with only the
        <p></p>simple task of heating the mixture of meat and seasonings.
        <p></p>As she used a cloth to dry the pot she had used and washed, Chitose watched him
        <p></p>frying the meat with a strange look in her eye. "…I thought you couldn't cook?"
        <p></p>"I keep telling you, I'm not completely helpless. I just look bad next to her; that's all."
        <p></p>The job he'd been assigned was to simmer the meat and seasonings, stirring the
        <p></p>mixture with a wooden spatula until the moisture was evaporated. He was offended
        <p></p>that she assumed he couldn't even manage this much. It wasn't like they were comic
        <p></p>book characters cooking up dark matter here.
        <p></p>Amane figured that most recipes got messed up when the cook used too much heat,
        <p></p>timed things poorly, or added too many ingredients. But they had Mahiru to guide
        <p></p>them, so they practically could not fail.
        <p></p>"If you must know, I memorized the recipe so I wouldn't get in the way."
        <p></p>"How thoughtful of you, Amane."
        <p></p>"Well, if I didn't pull my weight, the other guys would kill me."
        <p></p>He could feel them trying to stare daggers through him and could almost hear their
        <p></p>thoughts (…Is he gonna enjoy the angel's hand-cooked meal without working for it…?)
        <p></p>So he was trying to do something, at least.
        <p></p>Amane was fully aware that he was not naturally gifted at cooking, so he had studied
        <p></p>the recipe even more seriously than he would a textbook, but Mahiru had laughed at
        <p></p>him. "You don't have to take it that seriously," she had said at home, but he knew he
        <p></p>ought to be ready just in case.
        <p></p>Amane checked that the meat was browning and had started giving off a salty-sweet
        <p></p>aroma, and he stirred it appropriately with the wooden spatula so it wouldn't burn.
        <p></p>Beside him, Mahiru was using the other burner to cook scrambled eggs. Amane felt a
        <p></p>little embarrassed that she was making more than the usual amount because she
        <p></p>knew how much he loved eggs, but he was also happy she was thinking of him.
        <p></p>"Shiina, do I let this go a little longer?" he asked.
        <p></p>"That's right," Mahiru answered. "You should let it boil down a little bit more. But it'll
        <p></p>get dry if you simmer it too long, so please take it off the heat in about one minute."
        <p></p>"Mm, got it." He nodded.
        <p></p>Most of the moisture had already been cooked off, so he stirred the mixture with his
        <p></p>spatula to keep it from burning while Mahiru went back to her own work without
        <p></p>saying anything further.
        <p></p>Chitose was watching Amane and Mahiru from the side, and she shrugged, looking
        <p></p>slightly amazed. "…You know, the two of you seem, well, what can I say…? It's like
        <p></p>you're newlyw—"
        <p></p>"Chitose, please mind the miso soup."
        <p></p>"Eeep, yes, ma'am!"
        <p></p>Chitose let out an idiotic shriek for some reason and went to take the miso soup out
        <p></p>of the refrigerator.
        <p></p>Amane quickly looked over to Mahiru. "…Did something happen?"
        <p></p>"Nothing at all."
        <p></p>It didn't seem like nothing at all, but Mahiru didn't seem likely to tell him more, so he
        <p></p>gave up on getting any more information out of her and turned off the burner he had
        <p></p>been using to fry the meat.
        <p></p>By the time Mahiru had finished cooking the eggs and sliced and dressed the parboiled
        <p></p>spinach with seasonings, Itsuki had returned with the dishes.
        <p></p>"Aren't you a bit late?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, sorry. Some folks from the other teams came to talk to me."
        <p></p>Itsuki smiled flippantly, but his face didn't really look like he was joking around. He
        <p></p>wasn't the type to skip out on something like this, so he probably had actually gotten
        <p></p>held up talking to someone and couldn't extract himself right away.
        <p></p>It wasn't clear who he had spoken with or what they had talked about, but Amane got
        <p></p>the sense that it had something to do with Mahiru. Without her nearby, their jealous
        <p></p>classmates could speak freely, so they had probably directed their complaints at Itsuki
        <p></p>in Amane's stead. Of course, this was all conjecture; he didn't really know.
        <p></p>"Well, at any rate, I did my job, so…" Itsuki pointed to a tray bearing the right number
        <p></p>of plates and bowls.
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled gently at him. "Everything's ready. Let's arrange it and take a photo for
        <p></p>our report, then help ourselves, shall we?"
        <p></p>"Hell yeah!" Itsuki cheered. "I'm starving."
        <p></p>"That's 'cause you skipped breakfast, isn't it?" Chitose remarked.
        <p></p>"Not my fault; I overslept. Can I have an extra-big portion?"
        <p></p>"I don't mind," Mahiru replied. "I'm going to get the noodle salad now, so please
        <p></p>arrange things in the meanwhile."
        <p></p>Amane quickly spoke up. "I'll go with you, then. We've got to put the almond jelly with
        <p></p>everything else for the photo."
        <p></p>Amane said he would help, figuring Mahiru wouldn't have enough hands to carry the
        <p></p>dessert as well, and she nodded at him with her calm smile.
        <p></p>A little too late, he realized he should have sent Chitose, mostly to get it done without
        <p></p>inviting unnecessary speculation, but there was no going back now. Amane deliberately
        <p></p>kept a little distance between them as they headed for the refrigerator in the rear of
        <p></p>the kitchen classroom.
        <p></p>None of the other teams had Mahiru in their corner, so most of them weren't finished
        <p></p>yet. As usual, a few groups were only half-heartedly working through the exercise.
        <p></p>Amane thought it looked like they were going to get awful grades as he walked past
        <p></p>them indifferently.
        <p></p>There was even a team of boys who were chatting and fooling around instead of
        <p></p>cooking. One of them held his frying pan in one hand and laughed as he leaned away
        <p></p>from the table with an exaggerated movement—right into the path of a girl carrying a
        <p></p>pot full of soup.
        <p></p>In that instant, Amane sensed impending disaster and pulled Mahiru out of the way.
        <p></p>A few seconds later, he heard a loud splash followed by the faint, permeating smell of
        <p></p>milk as hot steam whirled around him.
        <p></p>The girl must have been making a cream soup, given the half a cup or so of thick white
        <p></p>liquid that was currently spreading across the floor. He peeled his eyes away to
        <p></p>confirm that none had splashed on Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Shiina, are you burned?"
        <p></p>"…Ah, no, it didn't hit me, but…"
        <p></p>Mahiru looked frozen with surprise.
        <p></p>The girl who had spilled her soup looked apologetic, and the face of the boy with the
        <p></p>frying pan who had bumped into her was ghastly pale.
        <p></p>"Did any of it hit you?" Amane asked the girl with the soup.
        <p></p>"Ah, n-no, I'm all right. S-sorry…!"
        <p></p>"It's okay. None of it hit me or Shiina, either."
        <p></p>Luckily, he had been quick to notice the danger, and neither Mahiru nor Amane was
        <p></p>injured.
        <p></p>He was quick to wave his hand and reassure his female classmate, who had set the pot
        <p></p>on a burner for the time being to apologize, while shooting a glance over at the boy
        <p></p>who had collided with her.
        <p></p>As one would expect, the other boys who had been joking around with him kept their
        <p></p>mouths shut, maybe because they felt guilty. They were looking practically everywhere
        <p></p>except in Mahiru's direction.
        <p></p>"…Look, guys, it's fine to live it up a little, but you can't mess around in a place with fire
        <p></p>and knives and stuff," Amane said. "If someone got hurt and it left a permanent mark,
        <p></p>you'd never forgive yourselves. Thank goodness nothing happened this time, but what
        <p></p>would you have done if you'd hurt one of the girls? Could you take responsibility for
        <p></p>that?"
        <p></p>It would be no laughing matter if someone got burned—or cut with a knife—and came
        <p></p>away from the incident with a scar. Amane wouldn't mind if he got hurt a little bit, but
        <p></p>it would be a serious problem if he injured another person, especially a girl.
        <p></p>Many girls, and even a lot of guys, would be pretty upset if they were left with a nasty
        <p></p>injury. And if someone got seriously hurt in a stupid accident like this, it wouldn't be
        <p></p>strange if they held a grudge.
        <p></p>Whether the wounded party was Mahiru or the other girl didn't matter. Someone
        <p></p>acting irresponsibly in a way that could cause injury to another person made Amane
        <p></p>angry, and he felt compelled to speak up.
        <p></p>Amane was usually very quiet and mostly kept to himself, so when the guilty boy, who
        <p></p>looked like he didn't expect to be told off, saw his narrowed eyes and heard his sharp
        <p></p>tone, he quickly tendered a disheartened apology.
        <p></p>"S-sorry…"
        <p></p>Realizing that if he spoke too forcefully, he was likely to cause a fight, Amane switched
        <p></p>to a more mellow tone of voice. "You don't need to apologize to me, but you'd better
        <p></p>apologize to Yamazaki, who you ran into, and to Shiina, who nearly got splashed.
        <p></p>Anyway, be more careful next time. The kitchen can be a dangerous place."
        <p></p>Then he looked at Mahiru.
        <p></p>He'd had one arm wrapped around her the entire time, and Mahiru's face had gone
        <p></p>slightly red. Though he felt some regret over touching her like that, it was too late to
        <p></p>worry about that now, so he gently released her and, taking care not to make any
        <p></p>strange faces, pointed toward the refrigerator.
        <p></p>"Shiina, I'm sorry for touching you without your permission. Please, go ahead and take
        <p></p>the salad over to our team. I'm going to help wipe up here."
        <p></p>"I-it's all right; I might have gotten jostled, but I'm the one who spilled everything,"
        <p></p>Yamazaki, the girl with the soup, stammered.
        <p></p>"Well anyway, I was involved, too, and all my team has left to do now is eat. It won't
        <p></p>take long, so don't worry about it."
        <p></p>She had only spilled a little bit, so cleaning it up wouldn't take that much time.
        <p></p>After reassuring his distressed classmate, Amane got the teacher's permission and
        <p></p>pulled off several sheets of paper towel from the roll on the counter and mopped up
        <p></p>the soup.
        <p></p>The small amount of liquid was quickly absorbed by the handful of towels. Right as
        <p></p>Amane was thinking that all he needed to do now was wipe it down with a wet towel,
        <p></p>Mahiru appeared from somewhere with a damp cloth in hand and did just that.
        <p></p>"It'll go faster if we work together," she murmured. Then she gave Amane an angelic
        <p></p>smile from up close, which was deeply unsettling for some reason.
        <p></p>"Welcome back!"
        <p></p>After they finished cleaning up, Amane and Mahiru returned to their table carrying
        <p></p>the noodle salad and almond jelly about five minutes later than expected, and Chitose
        <p></p>greeted them with an impish grin.
        <p></p>Amane's and Mahiru's portions, minus the salad and jelly, were already laid out on the
        <p></p>table, so Amane divided everyone's share of cellophane noodle salad into the salad
        <p></p>dishes and let out a sigh.
        <p></p>"I'm so tired…," Amane groaned.
        <p></p>"You looked pretty cool back there, man," Itsuki remarked. "And bold, for once."
        <p></p>"It's not like I was trying to cop a feel or anything," Amane insisted. "I had to get her
        <p></p>out of the way of the soup, that's all."
        <p></p>He hadn't set out to embrace the angel or anything. And even though no one had
        <p></p>criticized his split-second decision, several other boys did give him jealous looks that
        <p></p>made him uncomfortable.
        <p></p>As for Mahiru, she frowned at him just the slightest bit when she heard what he said.
        <p></p>Only someone who knew her well would have noticed this.
        <p></p>"Well, I feel like you really saved me. Thank you for holding me."
        <p></p>"I only did it because your apron or uniform might have gotten dirty, or even worse,
        <p></p>you might have been burned. That guy seemed sorry, too, so that's good."
        <p></p>As one would expect, the boy who had caused the collision received all the blame. After
        <p></p>all, they were in a place where a single misstep might result in a serious accident. At
        <p></p>the moment, the boy in question was getting a serious tongue lashing from their
        <p></p>teacher.
        <p></p>Amane was satisfied since ultimately no one had been hurt. And he hadn't been put at
        <p></p>risk, either. Yes, he had touched Mahiru where everyone could see, which could have
        <p></p>turned out worse than getting burned by hot soup. But judging by the atmosphere
        <p></p>around the classroom, he seemed to have been forgiven for that slipup.
        <p></p>"So if you can be that brave in the face of danger," Itsuki remarked, "then why are you
        <p></p>usually such a weenie?"
        <p></p>"I'm sorry, did you say something?" It was clear from the look in Amane's eyes and the
        <p></p>tone of his voice that he was not interested in hearing whatever rude thing his friend
        <p></p>was planning to say.
        <p></p>"Nothing at all," Itsuki grinned. "At any rate, we finished making our lunch without
        <p></p>incident, so let's take that photo, yeah?" He quickly occupied himself by fiddling with
        <p></p>the camera on his phone.
        <p></p>The students needed to check recipes and send in their photographs, so they were
        <p></p>being allowed to use their phones in class, but not for playing around. Itsuki was
        <p></p>obviously pointing his camera lens at people and not food, so Amane gave him an
        <p></p>exasperated look, but Chitose excitedly pushed her way into the camera's view.
        <p></p>"You too, Mahirun!" she urged. "Get in, get in."
        <p></p>"You guys…," Amane groaned.
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked dramatically, then drew her seat over slightly closer to Amane's with
        <p></p>a little smile.
        <p></p>Et tu, Mahiru…? Amane thought. He was surprised to see her flash him a quick, impish
        <p></p>little grin, just for a second, before she donned her angelic smile again.
        <p></p>"Come on, you too, Itsuki," Chitose insisted.
        <p></p>"Wait, but who will take the…? Oh, perfect timing, Yuuta! Come take this picture."
        <p></p>"Huh, what's this all of a sudden?"
        <p></p>Yuuta just happened to be passing by, probably on his way back from the refrigerator,
        <p></p>carrying a tray of thinly sliced pork. Itsuki pressed his smartphone into Yuuta's hand,
        <p></p>then circled around behind Amane and flashed a peace sign.
        <p></p>Yuuta looked surprised by the sudden request, but when he saw the completed dishes
        <p></p>lined up in front of Amane, he seemed to understand.
        <p></p>With a laugh, he said "Guess I've got no choice" and readied the smartphone. "You guys
        <p></p>sure finished fast, huh? Okay, I'm taking it."
        <p></p>"That's 'cause we got hustle, man!"
        <p></p>"But you hardly did anything, Itsuki," Chitose ribbed.
        <p></p>"C'mon, don't say that; you promised!"
        <p></p>Amane laughed at his friend's ridiculous protests. Then he heard the sound of the
        <p></p>camera shutter. He froze—Yuuta had taken the picture before he'd had time to compose
        <p></p>himself.
        <p></p>"That's a good picture!" Yuuta said, before handing Itsuki his smartphone and leaving.
        <p></p>"Wow, it's not every day I get a picture with Amane smiling," Itsuki remarked.
        <p></p>"That's 'cause he usually has a sour face on, right?" Chitose said. "Send the picture to
        <p></p>me, too, please!"
        <p></p>"Hoh-kay. Shiina, you get it from Chitose, okay?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had already exchanged contact information with Itsuki, but in this situation,
        <p></p>with people all around them, it was probably best not to say that out loud.
        <p></p>More importantly, it bothered Amane that Itsuki was sending the photo to Mahiru
        <p></p>before letting him check it.
        <p></p>He shot a look over at Mahiru and got an adorable, albeit restrained, smile in response,
        <p></p>so Amane could do nothing but groan and watch them quickly share the photo.
        <p></p>"…No one cares what my face looks like, so we might as well eat," Amane muttered,
        <p></p>hoping to end the conversation there.
        <p></p>Itsuki gave him a big grin, so before his friend could return to his own seat, Amane
        <p></p>poked him and turned away in a huff.
        <p></p>After that, Amane stuffed his face with the contents of the rice bowl Itsuki and Chitose
        <p></p>had thoughtfully served up with heaps of egg, and he quickly forgot the shame of being
        <p></p>photographed with a big grin. Mahiru just wore a happy smile, not paying Itsuki or
        <p></p>Chitose any attention.
        <p></p>"Aaamaaaneee, starting today we're eating lunch with you, too!"
        <p></p>One day, several days after the cooking class, Chitose bounded over wearing a beaming
        <p></p>smile, dragging Mahiru along behind her. Amane's cheek twitched.
        <p></p>He and Mahiru were acting less like acquaintances and more like regular friends around
        <p></p>each other. They'd even begun chatting together in public. But Amane wondered if
        <p></p>eating together might be moving too quickly.
        <p></p>Sure, if Chitose gave the pretense of coming over to eat with Itsuki, and Mahiru came
        <p></p>with her, they could probably live under the assumption that Chitose had simply
        <p></p>brought a friend. Their classmates shouldn't find that too enviable or suspicious,
        <p></p>Amane thought.
        <p></p>Allowing herself to be pulled along by Chitose, Mahiru wore a gentle smile, conducting
        <p></p>herself as she always did—like an angel.
        <p></p>But Amane was very troubled because he could also see something a little mischievous
        <p></p>in her expression. "Ah, maybe I should move over?" he asked.
        <p></p>Chitose was obviously not going to let him get away that easily. "Don't worry about it!
        <p></p>We're the ones who decided to join your table, after all."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help feeling like this was Chitose's idea. But even when he glared at
        <p></p>the smiling—no, grinning—Chitose, she didn't seem at all bothered.
        <p></p>She must have planned this with Itsuki, or maybe he was just happy to be eating with
        <p></p>his girlfriend, because Itsuki gave his usual smile and said, "Great idea; let's all eat
        <p></p>together."
        <p></p>Amane withered under the expected stares of jealousy from all around them.
        <p></p>"Oh, are Shirakawa and Shiina eating with us, too?" Yuuta asked as he stepped up to
        <p></p>the table, looking like he intended to join them.
        <p></p>Amane's stomach started to ache.
        <p></p>"Yes, we were planning to sit with them today," Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"Really, now?!" Yuuta smiled. "Well, we should have a rather lively lunch, then!"
        <p></p>Amane was feeling anything but lively.
        <p></p>He wasn't upset with Yuuta.
        <p></p>He was just in complete shock that Mahiru had come over.
        <p></p>I'm so screwed.
        <p></p>"…Just give in, Amane; we've got you surrounded," Itsuki mumbled quietly enough that
        <p></p>Yuuta couldn't hear, and Amane let out a huge, exhausted sigh.
        <p></p>"Do you usually bring your lunch to school, Shiina?" Yuuta asked, indicating the open
        <p></p>lunch box in front of Mahiru.
        <p></p>Amane and Itsuki always ate lunch in the cafeteria, so Mahiru and the others, who
        <p></p>usually ate in the classroom, had joined them.
        <p></p>Once each of the boys had returned to their seats carrying the lunches they had
        <p></p>ordered, Yuuta became curious about Mahiru's lunch box.
        <p></p>Incidentally, Mahiru was sitting straight across from Amane. Chitose had encouraged
        <p></p>her to take that seat, and there hadn't been an opening for Amane to escape.
        <p></p>"Yes, but usually it's just full of leftovers from dinner."
        <p></p>On weeknights, Mahiru often cooked things that would pack well into a lunch box,
        <p></p>separating the leftovers into one portion for Amane's breakfast and one portion for
        <p></p>her own lunch, so that was what she had packed today as well. He could see that the
        <p></p>box contained the teriyaki chicken meatballs they had eaten yesterday.
        <p></p>"Wow, a homemade meal?"
        <p></p>"Yes. But really, it's nothing special."
        <p></p>"Mahirun, it's not nice to lie!" Chitose interrupted. "You're super talented at cooking."
        <p></p>"How about apprenticing with Shiina?" Itsuki added.
        <p></p>Chitose pouted. "Itsuki, you're so mean!"
        <p></p>"You just need to get her to teach you how to season things. You can cook the dishes
        <p></p>themselves, but… your seasonings are strange."
        <p></p>As she clearly demonstrated during the cooking class the other day, Chitose was
        <p></p>actually a fairly accomplished cook. It was just that her desire to cause mischief often
        <p></p>led her to experiment with unorthodox flavors. Itsuki often complained that everything
        <p></p>would be fine, if she just didn't have that bad habit.
        <p></p>"Okay, I'll get Mahirun to start a one-on-one cooking class. We'll get Amane to be the
        <p></p>taste tester."
        <p></p>"I don't think so," Amane replied. "Besides, that'll make a lot of trouble for Shiina. Don't
        <p></p>be so quick to say stuff like that."
        <p></p>"Actually, I don't think it'll be any trouble at all," Mahiru said. "I think I'd enjoy cooking
        <p></p>with Chitose again."
        <p></p>"Yay! Mahirun, I love you! It'll be so much fun! Leave your calendar open, Amane!"
        <p></p>Chitose was sitting beside Mahiru, clinging tightly to her with a wide smile.
        <p></p>Mahiru was smiling, too, as she nodded in agreement. Amane felt deeply moved to
        <p></p>realize they had become very close friends.
        <p></p>Chitose just set up a date with Mahiru, right here in front of everyone, just like that.
        <p></p>Whether it was part of a larger plot, he couldn't say. But when he looked at Chitose, he
        <p></p>could see that she and Mahiru were smiling pleasantly at each other.
        <p></p>Amane's face twitched as he noticed all their nearby classmates had their ears pricked
        <p></p>up, emanating waves of unvoiced jealousy.
        <p></p>"…Hey, Itsuki?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"You think I have any chance of surviving this?"
        <p></p>"Eh, you'll be fine… probably."
        <p></p>He was getting dirty looks from Mahiru's fans, aka the boys who were madly in love
        <p></p>with her. It wasn't just his imagination. This had clearly been Chitose's suggestion, so
        <p></p>they weren't directing the full brunt of their bloodlust at him just yet, but he feared
        <p></p>what might happen the next time Mahiru suggested something, especially once it
        <p></p>became more obvious that they were good friends.
        <p></p>Yuuta leaned over. "That sounds like fun, huh, Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"…If I were you, I could probably get through this without people being so jealous."
        <p></p>If Amane was attractive and talented like Yuuta, then people would see him and
        <p></p>Mahiru as equals, and even if they were jealous, they'd think there was little to be done
        <p></p>about it and simply give up.
        <p></p>"But I'm also jealous of you, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>"Jealous of what?"
        <p></p>"All sorts of stuff," Yuuta said cryptically. Then he laughed.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't do anything but tilt his head in puzzlement.
        <p></p>Itsuki chimed in, "Now, hold on a minute. There may be something to what Yuuta's
        <p></p>saying."
        <p></p>"Seriously?"
        <p></p>"It's hard for people to recognize what they have. And those who have it can't
        <p></p>understand the feelings of those who don't. On top of that, we all want what we don't
        <p></p>have. Chi's definitely always whining about what she hasn't got."
        <p></p>"Meaning what?"
        <p></p>"Well, what's one thing that Mahiru has plenty of but Chi doesn't have…?"
        <p></p>"You're definitely thinking something perverted right now, aren't you?" Chitose
        <p></p>interrupted. Apparently, she had been listening to their conversation, and even though
        <p></p>she was wearing a broad grin, her eyes were not smiling.
        <p></p>Realizing that this topic was a proverbial land mine, Amane shut his mouth and
        <p></p>watched as Chitose and Itsuki started bantering back and forth. Then he glanced over
        <p></p>at Mahiru. She looked perplexed at Chitose and Itsuki's exchange, but when she met
        <p></p>Amane's eyes, her expression changed into a smile.
        <p></p>It wasn't her angelic smile, but something closer to the happy yet bashful expression
        <p></p>she let him see at home, so Amane got flustered and quickly averted his eyes.
        <p></p>"Were you surprised?"
        <p></p>At home, Mahiru was grinning impishly.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help but give her a wry smile back. "Surprised? I mean, I did think you
        <p></p>came on pretty strong."
        <p></p>"I know I said I was going to take it slow, but I thought it was about time to go to the
        <p></p>next step. I've also recently realized we won't make any progress if I don't push you a
        <p></p>little bit."
        <p></p>"That's true."
        <p></p>She had probably been extra proactive because she knew Amane was constantly ready
        <p></p>to flee, but in that setting, he had been surrounded and couldn't get away easily.
        <p></p>Amane had been startled because he hadn't expected Mahiru to be that pushy, but they
        <p></p>had simply talked. She hadn't tried to touch him or anything, so his mind was at ease.
        <p></p>If she had touched him innocently and casually like she did at home, he had no doubt
        <p></p>that deadly blades of jealousy would have closed in on him for the kill. He depended
        <p></p>on her, and she trusted him more than anyone else, but their classmates had no idea
        <p></p>about any of that.
        <p></p>"I'm trying my best to take things bit by bit, so that it doesn't shake up your routine
        <p></p>too much. But Amane, if something bothers you, please tell me, okay?"
        <p></p>Mahiru was perfectly aware of her popularity. Amane knew she was taking great pains
        <p></p>not to become too friendly with him too quickly, all so their classmates wouldn't get
        <p></p>jealous. Typical Mahiru—her first concern was protecting him.
        <p></p>Still, he couldn't deny that, this time, he felt like Chitose had gone a little too far. It was
        <p></p>too late to do anything about it now, though, so he would just have to be more cautious
        <p></p>moving forward.
        <p></p>"Well, it's okay for the time being…," Amane said. "Though, I do get jealous looks."
        <p></p>"Oh really? That's… Don't you hate that…?"
        <p></p>Apparently, she was still concerned about the fact that Amane had been sullen at first.
        <p></p>"But now I understand you were lonely. We were wrong to leave a friend out, and it
        <p></p>was obviously hard on you."
        <p></p>"…A friend, huh?"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"No, nothing."
        <p></p>It definitely seemed like something was bothering her, but Mahiru didn't appear
        <p></p>inclined to talk about it. When she turned away, Amane realized he must have done
        <p></p>something to dampen her high spirits.
        <p></p>He went right ahead and stroked her hair.
        <p></p>"…You aren't thinking you can solve everything just by patting my head a couple times,
        <p></p>right?"
        <p></p>"I don't, but I thought it might make you happy."
        <p></p>"Well, it does, but… please don't do it to just any girl when you're trying to smooth
        <p></p>things over."
        <p></p>"I don't do it to anyone but you, Mahiru…"
        <p></p>To begin with, the only other girl I'm friends with is Chitose. And there's no way I'm doing
        <p></p>this with her. Besides, I don't think it would make her very happy. No, Mahiru's the only
        <p></p>person I'd ever do this with—and the only person I'd ever want to. She's the only one I
        <p></p>want to pamper.
        <p></p>Amane thought he had made it clear that he was being serious. But Mahiru still looked
        <p></p>upset, and she pounded her fist into one of the cushions.
        <p></p>Amane started drawing his hand back and was surprised when she head-butted him
        <p></p>in the upper arm. It didn't hurt, but he was still shocked by how Mahiru had become
        <p></p>noticeably more aggressive lately.
        <p></p>"…Amane, you dummy."
        <p></p>"Why do you say that?"
        <p></p>"Just how hard do I have to try…?"
        <p></p>"I—I don't really understand what you're saying, but you'll wear yourself out if you try
        <p></p>anything too hard, so you should probably take it easy…"
        <p></p>"If I don't prod you along, we'll never get anywhere."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked a bit resentful as he peeked over the top of his shoulder, and yet he
        <p></p>thought he could see embarrassment and a touch of anticipation in her shimmering
        <p></p>eyes.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't bring himself to meet her gaze. "It r-really seems like you want
        <p></p>something from me."
        <p></p>"…I just want what happens next…"
        <p></p>Next—?
        <p></p>Mahiru must have wanted something further from Amane, but at the moment, she
        <p></p>didn't seem to be making any additional requests, so for the time being, Amane
        <p></p>decided to continue stroking her head gently and made every effort to please her.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 33: The Angel’s Proposal 
        <p></p>"Golden Week's pretty soon, huh?" Amane muttered quietly, gazing at the calendar on
        <p></p>the shelf.
        <p></p>April had been a busy month, and he had been preoccupied with moving up a grade
        <p></p>and Mahiru's big push to be friendly with him even at school. So before he knew it, the
        <p></p>end of the month was fast approaching, and Golden Week, highly anticipated by
        <p></p>students and adults alike, would soon be upon them.
        <p></p>Amane didn't particularly dislike his studies. Actually, if asked, he would say he enjoyed
        <p></p>them. Going to school was a little bit of a hassle but not any great hardship, so he
        <p></p>wasn't necessarily all that thrilled about the break. He simply thought it would be nice
        <p></p>to have some more time to relax.
        <p></p>Unlike last year, this year Mahiru would be with him for Golden Week, so he wouldn't
        <p></p>be bored.
        <p></p>Chitose had already claimed one of the days of his break for "taste testing at Mahiru's
        <p></p>cooking class," so far from boring, his vacation promised to be eventful and probably
        <p></p>difficult.
        <p></p>"Another long break is coming up…," Mahiru muttered.
        <p></p>"Yep, but is it me or do you not sound too thrilled?"
        <p></p>"It's not that I don't like breaks. I was just wondering how I'll kill the time."
        <p></p>Apparently Mahiru felt similarity. Both of them were homebodies, and they hadn't
        <p></p>made any plans to speak of.
        <p></p>"Yeah, I mean, I'm happy enough to get a break, but I don't really have anything to do."
        <p></p>Amane hadn't fallen behind in his schoolwork or anything, so he didn't feel like he
        <p></p>needed to go out of his way to pack his vacation with studying.
        <p></p>He didn't have an especially strong desire to partake in his hobbies of walking or
        <p></p>reading, and it wasn't like he needed to make plans for those anyway. Same with video
        <p></p>games. He really didn't have any plans.
        <p></p>"…Amane, are you free over the break?"
        <p></p>"I guess I am."
        <p></p>As things stood, all he had planned were his day as a taste tester for the impromptu
        <p></p>cooking class and going to karaoke at some point with Itsuki and Yuuta. The break was
        <p></p>a whole week long, so his schedule was still wide open.
        <p></p>He was about to say he'd most likely be relaxing at home, when he noticed Mahiru
        <p></p>staring up at him.
        <p></p>"What's the matter?"
        <p></p>He met Mahiru's gaze and saw that she looked like she had something to say. She
        <p></p>reached for her smartphone, which was on top of the table.
        <p></p>More accurately, she reached for the phone case.
        <p></p>Mahiru's phone case was the wallet type with spots to keep cards and such, and from
        <p></p>one of the card slots, she pulled a small plastic bag with a zipper.
        <p></p>Inside it were a number of folded slips of paper, and Mahiru took one of them out and
        <p></p>opened it up to show Amane.
        <p></p>Before he even had time to recognize it, he was looking at one of the DO ANYTHING
        <p></p>YOU SAY coupons he had given her a little over a month earlier.
        <p></p>Mahiru held out the coupon, decorated with an illustration of a bear that Amane
        <p></p>personally thought he had drawn quite well, and looked up at him pointedly again.
        <p></p>"Can I use it?"
        <p></p>"You can ask me to do anything you like."
        <p></p>"…Over Golden Week, I want one day with you," she said timidly. "I want to go shopping,
        <p></p>and hang out, and whatever else I request. All right?"
        <p></p>Amane let out a quiet laugh. "Come on, I would go shopping and stuff with you if you
        <p></p>asked. You don't really need to use a coupon for something so simple."
        <p></p>She probably wanted him to get all dressed up to take her out, but he would have done
        <p></p>that for her anytime, so he didn't think she had to go to so much trouble.
        <p></p>He laughed at her using her request for such a trivial thing, but Mahiru shook her head
        <p></p>with an earnest look in her eyes.
        <p></p>"Since I'm using the coupon… I get to ask for anything I feel like on that day."
        <p></p>"I-if you insist, that's fine, but… what are you planning to make me do?"
        <p></p>"…C-carry my bags."
        <p></p>"Yes, yes, as you wish."
        <p></p>He was tempted to crack a joke about her making him carry super-heavy bags, but
        <p></p>Mahiru just nodded. Even Mahiru, who was at heart an indoor person, sometimes
        <p></p>enjoyed going on an outing, and if she wanted him to accompany her, he intended to
        <p></p>do just that, as much as she desired. Besides, it was sure to have its benefits.
        <p></p>Although Amane would have preferred not to start a fresh wave of rumors about
        <p></p>Mahiru's mystery man, life would be dull if the fear of rumors kept them from going
        <p></p>anywhere.
        <p></p>"So where do you plan on taking us?"
        <p></p>"Ah, I—I haven't decided yet, but—"
        <p></p>"You haven't decided…?"
        <p></p>"…I mean, I'm not sure what kinds of places you like, so…"
        <p></p>"Huh, me?"
        <p></p>"Well, if we're out together, I thought it would be nice to pick a place we could both
        <p></p>enjoy. Is that all right?"
        <p></p>No one in the world could have refused Mahiru as she grabbed hold of his sleeve and
        <p></p>looked up at him imploringly.
        <p></p>Amane's breath caught in his throat, and his eyes darted about in confusion. Then he
        <p></p>roughly brushed back his hair and let out a small sigh.
        <p></p>"…I was just planning to go along with wherever you wanted to go, Mahiru, but well…
        <p></p>in that case, there is one place I'd like to go."
        <p></p>It was difficult for him to go in alone, but it was someplace he always wanted to try
        <p></p>going at least once.
        <p></p>"Where is that?"
        <p></p>"Promise not to laugh."
        <p></p>"I won't laugh."
        <p></p>"…A cat cafe ."
        <p></p>That's right, a cat cafe , filled to the brim with adorable cats.
        <p></p>Amane liked animals a fair amount, but of course he wasn't able to keep a pet in an
        <p></p>apartment and could only admire animals in magazines or other people's pets. But he
        <p></p>was too afraid of what people might think if they saw a single guy going to an animal
        <p></p>cafe . He was just too embarrassed to go.
        <p></p>However, if Mahiru was with him, he could go without worrying about other people's
        <p></p>stares following him. They might stare for other reasons, but he felt like he could at
        <p></p>least enter a cafe without reservations if Mahiru was by his side.
        <p></p>Besides all that, Amane also thought Mahiru would look very cute playing with cats,
        <p></p>but of course he couldn't say that out loud.
        <p></p>"…Well, I th-thought that if we were together, I wouldn't be embarrassed. Do you
        <p></p>mind?"
        <p></p>"N-no, not at all! All right then… Let's go together, shall we?"
        <p></p>"…Yeah."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't hide his nervousness. He felt both grateful and awkward that Mahiru
        <p></p>had accepted his request. She giggled softly, and heat began to creep up Amane's face.
        <p></p>Quickly, he changed the subject.
        <p></p>"What should we do after the cafe ?"
        <p></p>"After that, we'll go shopping together, and… ah, I want to try going to an arcade. I've
        <p></p>never been to a place like that."
        <p></p>Amane was not surprised to hear that the aristocratic Mahiru had never been to a
        <p></p>game center. But she was apparently interested, so in that case, he was more than
        <p></p>willing to take her to one and teach her the ropes.
        <p></p>The last game center he visited would probably have gotten a new shipment of stuffed
        <p></p>animals she would like by now, and it would be fun to win them together.
        <p></p>"All right, sounds like that'll be good. We'll go to a cat cafe , eat lunch, go shopping, and
        <p></p>go to a game center, okay?"
        <p></p>Amane sighed with relief once they had settled on their schedule for the day, and
        <p></p>Mahiru looked up again so he could see her face.
        <p></p>"Yep, I'm really looking forward to it."
        <p></p>He nearly stopped breathing when she looked at him so bashfully.
        <p></p>"I can't wait for the break to be here," she added quietly, and to Amane, it sounded like
        <p></p>she was looking forward to their outing from the bottom of her heart. She hugged the
        <p></p>cushion tightly, clearly in a good mood.
        <p></p>Amane was momentarily stunned by her sweet smile. He could feel his heart pounding.
        <p></p>"…Me too," he managed to reply hoarsely.
        <p></p>The surprise attack from the angel really made his heart ache
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 34: Fooling Around in the Angel’s Cooking Classroom 
        <p></p>"Welcome to the first-ever Mahirun Cooking Class!"
        <p></p>Chitose made this announcement with the rhythm and energy of a television cooking
        <p></p>program's intro. Amane shot her an annoyed look.
        <p></p>Golden Week had started, and they had decided to hold Mahiru's cooking class on the
        <p></p>first day of the break. The venue was Amane's apartment, for the simple reason that it
        <p></p>was an easy place for Mahiru and Chitose to meet.
        <p></p>Chitose's family was at her house, so they wouldn't be able to get too noisy, and Mahiru
        <p></p>had volunteered her place, but Amane had balked at going into a girl's apartment, so
        <p></p>they had settled on his.
        <p></p>Wearing an apron, Chitose was getting herself all worked up. "Yaaay! We've invited
        <p></p>Miss Mahiru Shiina to be our lecturer for the course!"
        <p></p>Mahiru, too, was wearing her apron and a wry smile as she stood next to Chitose.
        <p></p>"You didn't invite her anywhere," Amane insisted. "You're also a guest here, you know."
        <p></p>"And as our taste tester… we've invited the extremely tiresome Mr. Amane Fujimiya!"
        <p></p>"Oh, shut up. Also, this my house."
        <p></p>"He's no fun at all!"
        <p></p>Amane just couldn't keep up with Chitose's incredibly high-energy personality this
        <p></p>early in the morning. It was just past nine. They had planned to finish cooking around
        <p></p>lunchtime, so this was the only time they could meet.
        <p></p>Amane didn't really mind the hour, but Chitose was a lot to deal with right after waking
        <p></p>up.
        <p></p>"…Sorry about this, first thing in the morning…," Mahiru apologized.
        <p></p>"No, it's fine. You are making me lunch, after all," Amane insisted. "Though, speaking
        <p></p>of which, please keep an eye on Chitose so she doesn't put anything strange in it."
        <p></p>"O, ye of little faith!"
        <p></p>"Have you forgotten your previous offense on Valentine's Day…?"
        <p></p>He still hadn't forgotten the taste of her prank chocolates. The ones with nothing weird
        <p></p>in them had been delicious, of course, but the taste of the surprise special chocolates
        <p></p>had been shocking enough that he could recall it even now. And he couldn't trust
        <p></p>Chitose's palate, since she claimed she had been able to eat those experimental pieces
        <p></p>like regular sweets.
        <p></p>"Ah-ha-ha, but those were meant to be a prank. It'll be fine if I'm cooking normally.
        <p></p>Probably."
        <p></p>"That 'probably' worries me, you ass… I'm begging you, please make something I can
        <p></p>eat."
        <p></p>"Don't worry about it!" said Chitose confidently as she started rolling up her sleeves.
        <p></p>Amane felt a tinge of anxiety as he watched the girls set up, but he believed Mahiru
        <p></p>would probably intervene on his behalf somehow.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't compromise on dishes she planned to serve to other people, and she
        <p></p>was the one running this lesson, so Amane was confident they would make the food
        <p></p>properly, and everything would be fine.
        <p></p>With Chitose in tow, Mahiru headed for his kitchen as if it were her own home and
        <p></p>read out the names of the dishes on the day's menu.
        <p></p>Namely, today's lunch would consist of a quiche and salad, with shrimp bisque and a
        <p></p>saute of any excess ingredients. She had apparently decided to answer Amane's
        <p></p>request to include shrimp.
        <p></p>He was sure that everything would go okay, but he still worried about Chitose putting
        <p></p>something strange into the quiche.
        <p></p>"…I feel like you're being needlessly wary…," Chitose protested. Maybe she had noticed
        <p></p>him staring at her.
        <p></p>Amane averted his eyes and flopped down on the sofa. His job was to be a taste tester,
        <p></p>so he didn't really have to do anything, and that suited him just fine. He wasn't totally
        <p></p>useless as Mahiru's helper, but that was Chitose's role today, and anyway, he had been
        <p></p>instructed by Mahiru to sit down, so he couldn't move from his spot.
        <p></p>And so he had lots of free time.
        <p></p>He looked into the kitchen and saw the two girls in their aprons pleasantly chatting as
        <p></p>they started their work.
        <p></p>They were both beautiful girls in different ways, and having them both here, wearing
        <p></p>aprons and cooking in his apartment, would surely make any other boy in their class
        <p></p>drool with envy, Amane mused, as if he were an uninvolved observer.
        <p></p>Fighting off a second round of anxiety over whether the practical jokester might pull
        <p></p>something outrageous, Amane let his eyes drift closed, unsure of what else to do with
        <p></p>his glut of free time.
        <p></p>Apparently, cooking class would take several hours, so they probably wouldn't mind if
        <p></p>he took a little nap. It was his apartment, after all, so the only one who could blame
        <p></p>him for anything was… Mahiru.
        <p></p>Amane let out a small yawn and made himself comfortable on the sofa.
        <p></p>When he came to, Amane detected a sweet scent nearby. It was an aroma he had
        <p></p>become used to, a sweet fragrance that was milky and floral, hard to describe but
        <p></p>extremely pleasant, so without thinking, he inhaled deeply.
        <p></p>In his barely conscious state, he brought his face closer to the source of the smell and
        <p></p>felt something warm and soft to the touch. When he snuggled his cheek closer to the
        <p></p>pleasant warmth, it started to squirm.
        <p></p>"…Ah, um, that tickles…," said a halting voice from somewhere very close by. Amane
        <p></p>realized someone was patting his thigh. This quickly dragged his dim consciousness
        <p></p>up to the surface, and when he pried open his heavy eyelids… what he saw was an
        <p></p>expanse of smooth milky white.
        <p></p>He nervously lifted his head and found Mahiru's flushed face incredibly close to his.
        <p></p>She looked very embarrassed.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Yes?"
        <p></p>"…Uh… good morning?"
        <p></p>"Good morning. Although… actually, it's already time to say good afternoon."
        <p></p>He looked at the digital clock on the shelf and saw that it was past noon.
        <p></p>He had dozed off for quite a while, he realized. But what was Mahiru doing by his side?
        <p></p>"When I sat down next to you, you leaned onto me."
        <p></p>Mahiru answered his unspoken question, her cheeks still tinged slightly red.
        <p></p>Apparently, he had nestled his face into the area near her shoulder. The shirt she was
        <p></p>wearing today had a fairly open neckline, which left some skin peeking out, and that
        <p></p>seemed to be where he had stuck his face.
        <p></p>If he was unlucky, she might consider this a matter of sexual harassment, so he
        <p></p>prepared himself for her anger, but Mahiru seemed more embarrassed than angry and
        <p></p>just cast her eyes downward.
        <p></p>Personally, he would have preferred for her to get mad, because he was truly at a loss
        <p></p>for what to do when she reacted that way. He appeared to have been forgiven, which
        <p></p>made him uncomfortable.
        <p></p>"That's— I'm sorry," Amane apologized. "It must have been a pain."
        <p></p>"N-no, not at all!" she insisted.
        <p></p>"Quite the contrary, Mahirun said 'I'm going to take advantage of the fact that Amane's
        <p></p>half asleep' and sat down to catch your head."
        <p></p>"Chitose!" Mahiru turned even redder.
        <p></p>"And just when did you two start calling each other by your first names, I wonder?"
        <p></p>Chitose grinned.
        <p></p>"…Chitose."
        <p></p>"Don't scowl at me, Amane. You're the one who was careless!"
        <p></p>He couldn't argue with that. In his half-conscious state, he'd called Mahiru by her first
        <p></p>name even though Chitose was there. That was his error.
        <p></p>"And anyway, Mahirun already told me about how you two talk when no one else is
        <p></p>around…"
        <p></p>"Look, you—," Amane growled.
        <p></p>"S-sorry," Mahiru mumbled.
        <p></p>He quickly shook his head. "No, you're not to blame here, Mahiru."
        <p></p>Chitose cackled merrily. "Well, as far as I'm concerned, I think it's just great that the
        <p></p>two of you are getting so friendly! It's not a bad thing at all."
        <p></p>"You're a real pain, you know that?" Amane glared. "It's seriously not what you're
        <p></p>thinking."
        <p></p>"Ohhh?"
        <p></p>"What?"
        <p></p>"Uh-uh, nothing. Nooothing at aaall!"
        <p></p>Chitose sure seemed like she had a lot to say about nothing, but she shrugged as if she
        <p></p>had no intention of expressing it through words. Amane knew that when she got like
        <p></p>this, it was no good trying to question her, so he gave up on asking her anything further.
        <p></p>Beside him, Mahiru looked slightly concerned.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Huh? Oh, it's nothing."
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to come to her senses when he spoke to her. She hurriedly put on a
        <p></p>smile and shook her head, so he knew he couldn't question her any further, either. All
        <p></p>he could do was shut his mouth.
        <p></p>"…So we made lunch as promised. Wanna eat?" Chitose asked.
        <p></p>"Sure. I can't believe I dozed off until lunch…"
        <p></p>"You slept like a log, so we had plenty of time to play around, looking at your sleeping
        <p></p>face."
        <p></p>"…I don't suppose you pulled any pranks?"
        <p></p>"I did not!" Chitose insisted, though he knew better than to believe her. "What's got
        <p></p>you so worried, young man?"
        <p></p>"You did something other than a prank, didn't you?" Amane asked suspiciously.
        <p></p>"I'm telling you: I didn't do a thing!"
        <p></p>"I wonder. Mahiru, did she do anything to the food?"
        <p></p>He looked over at Mahiru to confirm, but she must have been caught by surprise when
        <p></p>he suddenly brought up the subject. She looked confused and smiled wryly.
        <p></p>"Chitose didn't do anything, but…"
        <p></p>"Really? If she did, I'm thinking of squeezing her until she pops—"
        <p></p>"No violence!"
        <p></p>Chitose was cackling with laughter even as she protested, and Amane could only sigh
        <p></p>in exasperation.
        <p></p>Finally—though Amane didn't really feel as if any time had passed, since he had been
        <p></p>asleep—it was indeed lunchtime.
        <p></p>Even Chitose seemed to have taken her cooking seriously for a change, and the table
        <p></p>was set with a beautifully cooked quiche and a bisque soup that was giving off the rich
        <p></p>aroma of shrimp.
        <p></p>They had served everything up on individual plates, so the salad, quiche, bisque, and
        <p></p>shrimp saute were carefully arranged to show off the rich array of colors. It looked
        <p></p>like a lunch that might be served at a cute cafe .
        <p></p>"Wow, everything looks great!" Amane exclaimed. "…Mahiru, how's the flavor?"
        <p></p>"It's all fine." She nodded. "Chitose didn't add anything strange, and I tasted everything
        <p></p>as we went."
        <p></p>"Great."
        <p></p>"You really don't trust me, geez! I made everything properly today, too. Rude."
        <p></p>Chitose was in a huff, but she had a history of launching surprise attacks right after
        <p></p>saying something similar, so Amane knew better than to let his guard down. This time,
        <p></p>though, Mahiru had been there to supervise, so Amane could mostly relax and eat.
        <p></p>"Ah, Mahiru made this quiche. I made one to give to Itsuki."
        <p></p>"You're gonna give him a whole quiche…?"
        <p></p>"It's a little one, about the size of my palm, so it's fine. Eh-heh-heh, I wonder if he'll be
        <p></p>happy with it…?"
        <p></p>Chitose was wearing a big grin, and Mahiru was staring at her with a heartwarming
        <p></p>smile of her own. As long as Chitose wasn't preoccupied playing pranks or getting up
        <p></p>to some other kind of mischief, she was a pretty thoughtful girlfriend. Amane thought
        <p></p>it was nice she had made something just for Itsuki.
        <p></p>But she did tend to take things too far, so it could be a little dangerous to trust her
        <p></p>completely.
        <p></p>Amane also smiled a little at the beaming Mahiru, then turned his attention to the plate
        <p></p>that had been set before him. He pressed his hands together. "All right, let's eat."
        <p></p>"Go ahead! Enjoy your meal!"
        <p></p>Chitose looked almost bashful. It was surprisingly endearing, and just for a moment,
        <p></p>Amane was reminded that she was a girl, too, after all.
        <p></p>"…Um, I'm sorry."
        <p></p>After Chitose left, Mahiru suddenly apologized.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure why she was apologizing, and he looked with wide eyes at Mahiru
        <p></p>sitting beside him. She had her legs drawn in and was fidgeting restlessly, wearing a
        <p></p>guilty expression.
        <p></p>"…Sorry about the pranks."
        <p></p>"Pranks?"
        <p></p>"Chitose didn't do anything to you, but… well, I did."
        <p></p>"Huh, you did?"
        <p></p>He was certain Chitose had said she hadn't done anything when he interrogated her,
        <p></p>and Mahiru had also confirmed that Chitose hadn't. But Mahiru hadn't said a single
        <p></p>word about whether she herself had been up to no good.
        <p></p>Amane had never even considered that Mahiru might do something to him and had
        <p></p>automatically excluded her from suspicion, but apparently she had been busy.
        <p></p>She looked guilty, like she wanted to run away at any moment.
        <p></p>"What did you do?"
        <p></p>"Well, I squished your cheeks…"
        <p></p>"…Does that really qualify as a prank?"
        <p></p>"A-and then I stared at your sleeping face, and I stroked your hair."
        <p></p>"Well, you do like doing that."
        <p></p>"…Y-yes."
        <p></p>"So… was that all?"
        <p></p>"…Yes."
        <p></p>The way she was acting, she seemed remorseful, but Amane wanted to joke that those
        <p></p>things were hardly pranks. What Mahiru had done was less of a prank and more like
        <p></p>normal physical intimacy. If that was a prank, then that would mean Amane had also
        <p></p>been messing with Mahiru, so he hoped she didn't think of it that way.
        <p></p>"I'm not really mad, you know. Like, as long as you were having fun, I guess it's fine; it
        <p></p>was just careless of me to fall asleep in front of other people."
        <p></p>"Th-thank you…"
        <p></p>"I mean, I don't think it would be much fun to look at this ugly mug, but…"
        <p></p>"…You looked cute, you know?"
        <p></p>"You're just about the only person who would say a guy like me looked cute."
        <p></p>"That's not true. Chitose said so!"
        <p></p>"She was definitely making fun of me…"
        <p></p>In Chitose's case, she obviously said he looked cute because she thought it was funny.
        <p></p>That was a different matter than Mahiru finding him cute. As a rule, nobody should
        <p></p>ever take Chitose too seriously, he thought.
        <p></p>"…You really were cute."
        <p></p>"Really?"
        <p></p>"I played with your cheeks a lot…"
        <p></p>"I wonder, is it that much fun to poke at a guy's cheeks?"
        <p></p>"It's more fun than you realize."
        <p></p>Based on his own body, Amane thought guys' cheeks would be very stiff compared to
        <p></p>girls' and therefore not that much fun to poke or play with. He didn't understand what
        <p></p>Mahiru found so great about it, but if it was the very act of poking that she found
        <p></p>enjoyable, then he supposed he shouldn't complain.
        <p></p>"Well, it's not like I can't relate," he said. "Your cheeks also feel nice to poke at."
        <p></p>He had played the same "prank" on Mahiru before.
        <p></p>That said, it wouldn't do to touch her too boldly, so he cautiously, gently poked her
        <p></p>with the tip of his finger.
        <p></p>Mahiru's cheek was soft and a little squishy and undeniably feminine. She obviously
        <p></p>took very good care of her skin, because it was smooth and lustrous. Just touching her
        <p></p>like this felt amazing. Telling himself that if Mahiru had touched his face, he should be
        <p></p>allowed to touch hers, Amane gently pinched her pliable cheek.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked up at him with a bit of dissatisfaction, and he knew he'd better not
        <p></p>overdo it, so he stroked the cheek gently with the pad of his finger to mollify her. He
        <p></p>moved gently and carefully, just like he would if he were petting a kitten.
        <p></p>"…Hmm."
        <p></p>Before long, the look of dissatisfaction faded and was replaced by a soft smile that
        <p></p>seemed to be hiding something. It was such a sweet expression, he wondered if the
        <p></p>secret ingredient was plenty of honey.
        <p></p>…She looks really relaxed.
        <p></p>He was surprised to see how relaxed Mahiru looked while a boy touched her like that.
        <p></p>Then it occurred to him that Mahiru never let boys touch her, and he suddenly felt very
        <p></p>embarrassed to be receiving such special treatment. It made him want to bang his
        <p></p>head on the back of the sofa.
        <p></p>Trying to put such thoughts out of his mind, Amane reached his hand under Mahiru's
        <p></p>chin, and this time he really moved his fingers like he was petting a cat.
        <p></p>"Hyah!" She let out a small yelp. "…Wh-what was that?"
        <p></p>"Practice for when we go to the cat cafe ."
        <p></p>"What were you thinking? I'm not a cat, I'm a person!"
        <p></p>"It's because you're so catlike. But also kind of like a dog and a bunny at the same time."
        <p></p>"What are you talking about…?"
        <p></p>"Exactly what I said."
        <p></p>Recently, Amane had made the private observation that Mahiru at times acted like a
        <p></p>cat, a dog, and even a rabbit. When he was first getting to know her, she had been a
        <p></p>very wary cat, then as they became closer, she became friendly like a dog… not exactly
        <p></p>the same, but she had definitely warmed up to him. As for the rabbit… for some reason,
        <p></p>Amane had gotten it into his head that rabbits were lonely creatures, so he had just
        <p></p>thrown that one in the mix for good measure.
        <p></p>Amane was glad she didn't hate being doted on, since he wanted to do exactly that. As
        <p></p>he scratched under her chin, Mahiru quietly said "The top of my head would be better,"
        <p></p>so he obediently switched to stroking her head.
        <p></p>He decided not to mention that, at times like this, she was more doglike.
        <p></p>"…If I'm a cat and a dog and a bunny… In that case, Amane, you're a wolf."
        <p></p>"Does that mean I attack girls…?"
        <p></p>"N-no, I don't mean it like that! Wolves seem to care about their companions a lot. I've
        <p></p>heard they do anything to protect their pack. Well, since their packs are usually formed
        <p></p>of family members, I guess it's a little different, but I say that because you take really
        <p></p>good care of the people in your circle."
        <p></p>"…Well, I guess you've got me there."
        <p></p>Amane's circle of friends was pretty small. Small enough that he could count the
        <p></p>people he would call friends on two hands. But he always tried to do the best he could
        <p></p>for those people and treat them well. If she was going to call that facet of him wolflike,
        <p></p>then he wasn't going to argue.
        <p></p>"B-besides… that's how I want you to be."
        <p></p>"That's how you want me to be?"
        <p></p>"…No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it. Um, also, your hair is fluffy, which is why
        <p></p>you're like a wolf."
        <p></p>"That's not a trait of wolves."
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed like she had been about to say something different, but now she was
        <p></p>stroking Amane's hair, so he didn't question her and just let her touch his hair as she
        <p></p>pleased.
        <p></p>It was the day after the cooking class, and Mahiru apparently had plans to hang out
        <p></p>with Chitose again, so she departed after preparing Amane's lunch.
        <p></p>Amane would have been perfectly capable of feeding himself without her help, but she
        <p></p>went to all the trouble of cooking for him, so he wasn't about to complain.
        <p></p>He saw her off as she left his apartment, looking somewhat restless, then sighed as he
        <p></p>wondered how he should spend his free time.
        <p></p>It was currently just past one thirty. Mahiru had gone out, and it wasn't a bad time for
        <p></p>going out, but he didn't really feel like it since he had nothing in particular planned. If
        <p></p>he'd had plans to hang out with someone, he could have probably summoned the
        <p></p>willpower to leave the apartment, but if no one waiting for him, then he figured he
        <p></p>didn't need to go to the trouble.
        <p></p>That left him with the question of what to do with his day. There weren't that many
        <p></p>ways he could kill time at home.
        <p></p>His most frequent pastimes were games and comics, but he had cleared all the
        <p></p>scenarios in his role-playing games and even finished all the speedruns, and it wasn't
        <p></p>all that interesting to play party games by himself.
        <p></p>So he was down to comics and novels, but Amane didn't typically keep a lot of books
        <p></p>around, and he had already read the ones he had several times over and knew all the
        <p></p>plots. Amane was a fast reader anyway, so he would probably breeze through a whole
        <p></p>comic book series in an hour.
        <p></p>Amane was at a loss for what else he could do. For the moment, he went into his
        <p></p>bedroom and opened the textbook that was lying on his desk.
        <p></p>Chitose would look so confused if she could see me now.
        <p></p>Amane didn't have much to do, and they did have homework even during Golden Week.
        <p></p>And after Golden Week, midterm exams were waiting for them. He actually enjoyed
        <p></p>studying a fair bit, so he figured it might be a good way to spend his day if he didn't
        <p></p>have any other ideas.
        <p></p>One way or another, he had to get through their assigned homework, and he wanted
        <p></p>to be able to enjoy tomorrow's outing without having it in the back of his mind the
        <p></p>whole time. So he decided it was best to go ahead and get his academic obligations out
        <p></p>of the way.
        <p></p>Amane was naturally a serious student, and he pulled himself up to his desk,
        <p></p>mechanical pencil in hand, to complete his schoolwork.
        <p></p>When he next noticed the time again, it was already past six o'clock.
        <p></p>Whenever Amane was seriously concentrating, he tended to tune everything else out.
        <p></p>As he left his bedroom, rolling his shoulders around to loosen up his stiff body, he
        <p></p>smiled at how the sunbeams that were filtering through the window had changed
        <p></p>their angle bit by bit.
        <p></p>He could see the kitchen as soon as he was out in the hallway, and sure enough, there
        <p></p>was Mahiru in her apron. She hadn't been there the last time he'd left his room to take
        <p></p>a break.
        <p></p>Apparently, she had returned from her outing.
        <p></p>He wasn't sure if it was a good thing that he had been so focused he hadn't even noticed
        <p></p>the sound of the door unlocking in the entryway, but he knew it wasn't good that he
        <p></p>hadn't come out to greet her.
        <p></p>"Welcome back. Sorry I didn't greet you."
        <p></p>"No, it's fine… I didn't call out to you, either. I thought you were probably busy with
        <p></p>something in your room."
        <p></p>"I was doing homework."
        <p></p>He had made plenty of progress in the quiet apartment, but he might have been
        <p></p>studying too long, because his body was awfully stiff. He regretted not changing his
        <p></p>posture a little more often while reading.
        <p></p>He did some light stretching while they talked, and Mahiru let out a small giggle.
        <p></p>"You're very studious."
        <p></p>"I'm the type who likes to get my work done ahead of time so I can enjoy myself."
        <p></p>"I'm much the same. Though I prefer to do my studying intermittently."
        <p></p>"You're even more serious about schoolwork than I am."
        <p></p>Generally speaking, Amane was also the type to study on and off and steadily etch
        <p></p>things into his memory by repetition, but he wasn't as scrupulous and methodical as
        <p></p>Mahiru.
        <p></p>Incidentally, he had learned over the last summer break that Itsuki would finish his
        <p></p>work first and then really play around, while Chitose would play first and then drown
        <p></p>in her own tears of regret, so he expected the latter half of summer vacation this year
        <p></p>to be rough going.
        <p></p>"Once you make a habit of it, it's really not that much trouble," Mahiru explained. "Once
        <p></p>it becomes second nature, you don't think anything of it."
        <p></p>"Impressive. I've got to put in some more work, until it becomes second nature."
        <p></p>Most people assumed that Mahiru was some kind of prodigy, a genius blessed with a
        <p></p>naturally brilliant mind. Those people didn't know how hard she worked. Amane
        <p></p>would never deny that she was very smart, but he knew that, above all else, she was a
        <p></p>hard worker first and foremost.
        <p></p>She didn't show it much on the surface, but behind the scenes, she never failed to put
        <p></p>in the effort. That was why her grades and her looks and her athletics were all
        <p></p>outstanding.
        <p></p>Amane knew how hard Mahiru worked, so he recognized and admired her efforts and
        <p></p>didn't begrudge her successes. Mahiru's abilities were earned through being disciplined,
        <p></p>and anyone who wanted the same for themselves would have to put in the same labor.
        <p></p>Amane doubted he would ever be able to reach Mahiru's level, but as someone who
        <p></p>always wanted to improve his grades, he admired her.
        <p></p>Mahiru was frowning like something had tickled her. "Flattery will get you nowhere,
        <p></p>mister. At best, you might get pudding after dinner."
        <p></p>"Oh, then should I praise you more?"
        <p></p>"How calculated."
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled like something was funny. Amane gave her a sidelong glance, but when
        <p></p>he opened the refrigerator, he realized there really was pudding inside. It was storebought, but it came from the patisserie that Chitose liked so much, and it was one of
        <p></p>Amane's favorites, too. Though Mahiru's handmade pudding was the best, this was
        <p></p>also sure to be delicious. A surge of happiness bubbled up within him.
        <p></p>Mahiru giggled when she saw Amane's face light up all of a sudden, so he came back
        <p></p>to his senses and felt a bit embarrassed.
        <p></p>"You really do love eggs, don't you?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, I do."
        <p></p>There was no need to hide it in front of Mahiru, who already had a thorough
        <p></p>knowledge of his culinary preferences, so he meekly nodded in agreement.
        <p></p>Suddenly, Mahiru froze in place, still stiffly holding a potato she had just finished
        <p></p>washing. Amane tried to look at her face to see what was the matter, but she quickly
        <p></p>turned away.
        <p></p>"Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"…It's nothing. More importantly, if you're not going to help, I recommend you leave
        <p></p>the kitchen."
        <p></p>"So harsh all of a sudden. I actually came in here intending to help, but…"
        <p></p>Still, he wasn't going to make Mahiru do all the work alone. Besides, a little light
        <p></p>activity would be just perfect for waking up his stiff limbs.
        <p></p>Amane grabbed his apron from the kitchen rack and put it on. Mahiru wordlessly put
        <p></p>several washed potatoes in a bowl and handed it to him along with a peeler. She didn't
        <p></p>look him in the eye the whole time.
        <p></p>"By the way, what are we going to make with these potatoes?"
        <p></p>"…I was planning to make potato salad, but now they're going to be ingredients for a
        <p></p>frittata."
        <p></p>"Isn't that a pretty big change?"
        <p></p>"It's fine. I'm in charge of the kitchen. You just need to follow what I say."
        <p></p>"I—I don't really get it, but you make a good point."
        <p></p>This was Amane's kitchen, but Mahiru was in charge of the cooking, so this kitchen
        <p></p>was actually under Mahiru's control. After all, Amane didn't know nearly as much
        <p></p>about culinary matters as she did, so he was better off obediently following her lead.
        <p></p>Mahiru was obviously not in a good mood, and Amane wondered about her cold tone
        <p></p>as he washed his hands and began to peel the potatoes. Fortunately, he didn't need to
        <p></p>worry about injuring himself with a peeler.
        <p></p>Mahiru, meanwhile, had started her own tasks. It seemed like the change in menu had
        <p></p>been pretty sudden, but Mahiru knew what was in the refrigerator best anyway, so
        <p></p>Amane was sure there was no problem.
        <p></p>"…So what did you do today?"
        <p></p>The kitchen was spacious enough that the two of them could work side by side, and
        <p></p>he wouldn't have minded working in silence, but Amane's task wasn't that hard, so he
        <p></p>tried to strike up a conversation.
        <p></p>Mahiru's whole body twitched.
        <p></p>"Eh… um, well… I—I got her advice on something, I guess."
        <p></p>"Oh, was something giving you trouble? Did you sort it out?"
        <p></p>Honestly, Amane hoped Mahiru would come to him if she ever had a problem. But
        <p></p>there were probably a lot of issues only another girl would fully understand, so he
        <p></p>wasn't about to complain or anything.
        <p></p>"Y-yeah, sort of. I'll know for sure in a few days."
        <p></p>"Hmm. That's good, then."
        <p></p>If she had solved her problem, then Amane had nothing further to say, and he promptly
        <p></p>shut his mouth, knowing it would be bad to pry.
        <p></p>Mahiru tugged nervously at her apron.
        <p></p>"…Amane?"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"Uh, um, Amane… Which style do you like better, simple and clean or more mature?"
        <p></p>Her eyelashes fluttered as she peered at him with a troubling expression.
        <p></p>He didn't ask why she was suddenly asking him such a question. He figured she must
        <p></p>be trying to decide what kind of look was best for their outing tomorrow or something.
        <p></p>"I think it's best when the style suits the person wearing it," he finally answered.
        <p></p>"I'm asking about your preferences."
        <p></p>"I don't know what to say. It's nice to see a woman in something that really suits her,
        <p></p>but I think everyone should just wear what they feel comfortable in."
        <p></p>"…I'm asking about your preferences."
        <p></p>"Uh…"
        <p></p>Amane really thought it was best for Mahiru to wear whatever she liked, but she didn't
        <p></p>seem content to take that as his final answer.
        <p></p>"I really think either style is fine. A simple look suits your personality and looks cute,
        <p></p>and a sophisticated look brings out your beauty more. I think either one looks great
        <p></p>on you. There's something to like about each of them, but I can't say which look I like
        <p></p>better unless I see the actual outfits."
        <p></p>"…Y-you really do just come out and say things like that pretty bluntly, don't you? Agh…"
        <p></p>"I mean, you asked. Hmm, I guess go with the simple look."
        <p></p>He was getting the feeling that she wanted him to come out and pick one, so he obliged.
        <p></p>Mahiru turned away from him. "All right, I'll do that," she answered. "I'll do my best to
        <p></p>put together a look that will astonish even the calm and collected Amane."
        <p></p>"That seems like it won't end up being very simple…"
        <p></p>"Fine, I'll wear something that will make you lose your mind."
        <p></p>"Don't go too far; I won't know what to do."
        <p></p>"That's what I'm hoping."
        <p></p>Mahiru was being awfully forward today, but it was still adorable, just in a different
        <p></p>way. Amane chuckled to himself and continued peeling potato skins.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 35: An Outing with the Angel 
        <p></p>"Good morning, Amane."
        <p></p>Most people would start an outing by meeting up somewhere, but Mahiru met him at
        <p></p>his apartment. Since she lived next door, they didn't need to go to the trouble of
        <p></p>arranging a meeting place. Instead, Mahiru came directly to his door.
        <p></p>She certainly did look different.
        <p></p>"Morning… Oh, you put your hair up today."
        <p></p>"I thought it would get in the way if we're going to be playing with cats. How do you
        <p></p>like it?"
        <p></p>Mahiru usually wore her long hair down, but today it was braided and gathered up in
        <p></p>a bun. It looked like a more complex version of what she did with it when she was
        <p></p>cooking.
        <p></p>"Yeah, it looks good."
        <p></p>"It's nice of you to say so, but… W-well… if you're going to laugh, just laugh, okay?"
        <p></p>"What are you talking about?"
        <p></p>"…You think it looks silly, don't you?"
        <p></p>Mahiru was squeezing her arms tightly over her chest. Her outfit showed a little bit
        <p></p>more skin than usual.
        <p></p>Putting it that way might make it seem like she was wearing a very exposing outfit,
        <p></p>but her top was a chiffon blouse with an open collar, and the pure-white skin of her
        <p></p>neck was peeking out, which just gave the illusion of more exposure.
        <p></p>The blouse had a long lantern sleeve with slits in the sides and lace panels that ran
        <p></p>along the length so her upper arms were partially hidden but still showed through. It
        <p></p>was subtly enticing.
        <p></p>Of course, she had an undershirt on, so it wasn't like he was at risk of seeing anything
        <p></p>if he looked at her from above, but somehow he found the look both tidy and alluring
        <p></p>in the way it enhanced her femininity.
        <p></p>On the bottom she was wearing skinny jeans, perhaps because she was preparing to
        <p></p>play with cats at the cafe . The jeans fit tightly to her figure, hugging her slender legs.
        <p></p>On her wrist she wore the flower bracelet Amane had given her as a present. He
        <p></p>remembered her saying she was going to wear it with care, and he felt a warmth in his
        <p></p>chest.
        <p></p>"I don't think you look silly. In fact, I think you look even prettier than usual."
        <p></p>"Well, don't you look the part today? Your parents must have raised you to be a proper
        <p></p>gentleman."
        <p></p>"Dad always told me that you ought to compliment a girl when she's all dressed up…
        <p></p>Of course, it's not just flattery, you know."
        <p></p>"…I'll believe you."
        <p></p>Mahiru's face flushed slightly red, and she held her bag tight. Amane smiled wryly and
        <p></p>almost patted her head, but he stopped himself. He expected she wouldn't be pleased
        <p></p>if he messed up her elaborate hairdo before they even started their outing.
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked like she'd been expecting it but seemed to understand he was being
        <p></p>considerate of her hair, and so she smiled at him. She did give Amane's hand a bit of a
        <p></p>wary look, though.
        <p></p>"…Amane, recently you've been a little obsessed with patting my head, haven't you?"
        <p></p>"If you don't like it, I'll stop. I know I shouldn't touch you too excessively."
        <p></p>"N-no, that's not what I meant… I, um, I want to be able to play with your hair, too,
        <p></p>when I want to."
        <p></p>"That's fine; I don't mind, but you can't do it now. I've got wax in it."
        <p></p>Amane had donned his "mystery man" outfit to go out with Mahiru, taking the time to
        <p></p>carefully arrange his hair. His outfit choice was relaxed, consisting of a denim jacket
        <p></p>over a white V-neck shirt plus some slim black trousers. It was obviously not as much
        <p></p>effort as Mahiru had gone to, but Amane was used to looking like a slob next to her,
        <p></p>and this time he'd at least tried.
        <p></p>"…So I can touch your hair?"
        <p></p>"I don't really mind, but for today, let's make do with petting cats."
        <p></p>"I—I didn't mean I wanted to do it right now, you know. I can do it later, I guess…"
        <p></p>"I've been doing it to you, so it's only natural that you should get a chance. Fair
        <p></p>turnabout and all."
        <p></p>He didn't particularly dislike it when Mahiru touched his hair… If anything, it felt really
        <p></p>nice, and if Mahiru enjoyed it, he was happy to let her continue. Mahiru had seemed
        <p></p>flustered at first by Amane agreeing so easily, but now she was finally wearing a happy
        <p></p>smile.
        <p></p>"…Okay, then we're agreed: I'll do it later. For now, let's go pet lots of cats."
        <p></p>"Sure."
        <p></p>"Off we go, then?"
        <p></p>"Mm."
        <p></p>Thinking that setting out together from the same apartment felt a little embarrassing
        <p></p>somehow, Amane left his place with Mahiru.
        <p></p>As they walked side by side, the thought occurred to Amane to extend his hand to her.
        <p></p>"Here, have a hand," he said lightheartedly.
        <p></p>Mahiru flushed faintly and smiled as she squeezed his hand.
        <p></p>He had done a degree of preliminary investigation, but when they actually entered the
        <p></p>cat cafe , it was much more spacious than Amane had imagined.
        <p></p>After the two had signed in and used hand sanitizer, they stepped into the main cafe
        <p></p>area. As expected, they could see cats everywhere, walking around or curled into balls
        <p></p>or playing with other patrons.
        <p></p>"Wow… It's pretty big. And clean."
        <p></p>The cafe offered food and drinks, so perhaps it was to be expected, but the cleanliness
        <p></p>of the place still surprised him. He could barely smell any of the scents characteristic
        <p></p>of many places where animals made their home. In fact, it was nearly odorless.
        <p></p>He had looked at the reviews online, and this seemed to be a cat cafe that was prized
        <p></p>for its hygiene and took good care of its cats. It was a popular place, but to keep the
        <p></p>cats from getting stressed, it had only a few seats. There were also many hideouts for
        <p></p>the cats, and in the end, the cafe seemed to be set up less for touching the cats than for
        <p></p>sharing the space with them.
        <p></p>This cafe had a time-limit system, and the fees were high, but it was such a beautiful
        <p></p>and calm space that he didn't mind paying at all.
        <p></p>"Whoa… cats… Look, Amane, they're all so cute!"
        <p></p>There were cats with the other customers, so Mahiru spoke in a quiet voice, but he
        <p></p>could hear her eager excitement as she tugged on his sleeve. There were all sorts of
        <p></p>cats around, and Mahiru's eyes sparkled as she looked at them eagerly.
        <p></p>The topic of animals had never really come up, but apparently she really liked cats.
        <p></p>She was so excited, Amane could feel his mouth curling into a smile.
        <p></p>"You're right; they're really cute."
        <p></p>"So cute!" Mahiru didn't seem to realize how cute she was being herself as she looked
        <p></p>at the profile chart she had received from the receptionist, listing the cats' names and
        <p></p>breeds along with photos. She pointed to the Siamese cat beside her. "Ah, that one's
        <p></p>name is Silky!"
        <p></p>Only the fur on its tail and around its face was black, while the rest of the coat on its
        <p></p>long, slender body was a dazzling white. It had characteristic blue eyes and exuded an
        <p></p>air of nobility.
        <p></p>Mahiru was itching to pet it, but suddenly touching the cats was prohibited, so she
        <p></p>kept an eye on it from the side as she slowly brought her fingers closer to its nose and
        <p></p>let it sniff her.
        <p></p>The cat's nose twitched.
        <p></p>She didn't say it out loud, but Mahiru clearly thought even that was cute, so she
        <p></p>definitely seemed to like cats a lot.
        <p></p>But after getting a full sniff of Mahiru's scent, Silky abruptly and gracefully dashed
        <p></p>away.
        <p></p>Mahiru was clearly disheartened.
        <p></p>"That doesn't necessarily mean she hates you; I think she was just done saying hello."
        <p></p>"R-right, I suppose that's fair…"
        <p></p>"Come on, I think we should let the cats take their time and get used to us. Let's go
        <p></p>have a seat for now, okay?"
        <p></p>Mahiru stood back up, he took her hand, and they sat down on an open sofa. Once there,
        <p></p>Amane finally took a slow look around the whole room and saw that there certainly
        <p></p>were a lot of types of cats.
        <p></p>The cat from a moment ago had been a Siamese, but there were American shorthairs,
        <p></p>Russian blues, munchkins, Bengals, and even more exotic breeds—cats with great
        <p></p>individuality here, there, and everywhere.
        <p></p>At the next seat over, a short distance from them, an American shorthair was curled
        <p></p>up on the table, and the girl sitting there was gently stroking it.
        <p></p>"So cute…"
        <p></p>Mahiru was looking at the other customers without bothering to disguise the envy in
        <p></p>her eyes. Amane smiled wryly and looked over the menu.
        <p></p>The food and drink offerings at this cafe were supposed to be delicious.
        <p></p>The top recommendation seemed to be a latte with a cat design on top, formed out of
        <p></p>the milk foam. Apparently, the staff was talented at making latte art, and many people
        <p></p>had uploaded pictures.
        <p></p>Amane left Mahiru to her own devices for a moment, as she was staring at a cat
        <p></p>loitering nearby, and he called the waiter over and ordered the signature latte art.
        <p></p>"I went ahead and ordered you the same thing as me, is that all right?" he asked when
        <p></p>he had finished.
        <p></p>"Huh? Ah yes, that's fine."
        <p></p>As expected, Mahiru was so preoccupied with the cats that she hadn't even noticed
        <p></p>him ordering. Mahiru was the type who could drink coffee or tea, so since this was a
        <p></p>special outing, he decided to keep the order a secret and give her a little surprise.
        <p></p>After a short while, their order was brought over. Slowly, so as not to destroy the latte
        <p></p>art, their smiling waiter set the cups down on the table, bowed, and left. Mahiru
        <p></p>couldn't take her eyes off the latte art atop her cup.
        <p></p>"Is this okay?"
        <p></p>"Y-yes, it's super cute…"
        <p></p>"I'm glad."
        <p></p>On Mahiru's drink, the milk foam had been poured with great care to form a cat that
        <p></p>was curled up asleep, its coat pattern and expression drawn with cocoa powder. In
        <p></p>Amane's cup, they had drawn a cat leaning against the rim. The cute, dainty depictions
        <p></p>of the cats made it easy to understand why the cafe had become so popular.
        <p></p>Perhaps to preserve the excitement, Mahiru was taking photos with her smartphone
        <p></p>and looking quite pleased, but then for some reason her expression turned. "It's so
        <p></p>cute I can't drink it…," she muttered.
        <p></p>She sounded so serious. Amane couldn't help but laugh.
        <p></p>"D-don't laugh at me, please."
        <p></p>"It's just—you're so troubled over something so adorable."
        <p></p>"B-but… it would be such a waste to destroy it when there's such a cute little cat…"
        <p></p>"But it would be even more of a waste not to drink it."
        <p></p>"Oh no."
        <p></p>It wasn't that he didn't understand Mahiru's feelings, but the foam would collapse
        <p></p>anyway even if she left it alone, and he presumed that the person who made the coffee
        <p></p>would probably be happier if she drank it before it got cold.
        <p></p>After sufficiently appreciating his own latte cat, Amane raised his cup without
        <p></p>hesitation. He almost laughed again when he heard a murmur of sadness from beside
        <p></p>him, but somehow he contained it enough to slowly sip his caffe latte.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked so downhearted that he tried his best to drink without disturbing the
        <p></p>cat too much. The latte itself was delicious. The combination of the deep coffee flavor
        <p></p>and the rich milk was just perfect. And it wasn't too sweet, so Amane, who drank his
        <p></p>coffee black, didn't mind it.
        <p></p>"Mm, it's good."
        <p></p>When he took a break from drinking and made this comment, Mahiru groaned slightly
        <p></p>but brought her cup to her lips with some hesitation.
        <p></p>She looked funny and cute drinking her latte and carefully trying to not destroy the
        <p></p>cat, and Amane's lips must have curled into an unintentional smile.
        <p></p>"I—I feel like you're laughing at me, but—"
        <p></p>"You're imagining things. Is it good?"
        <p></p>"Yes, it is, of course."
        <p></p>When Amane looked at Mahiru once she had pulled her mouth away from the cup and
        <p></p>set it back down, he couldn't control himself, and his shoulders shook with laughter.
        <p></p>"Wh-why are you laughing?"
        <p></p>"Well, you have a white moustache."
        <p></p>She must have failed to pay attention to the rest of the milk foam in her efforts to keep
        <p></p>the cat intact, for Mahiru's upper lip was now decorated with a white moustache
        <p></p>reminiscent of Santa Claus.
        <p></p>She looked so extremely cute that he instinctively snapped a photo with his phone.
        <p></p>"Uh, d-did you just take a picture?!"
        <p></p>"Sorry. Do you want me to delete it?"
        <p></p>"W-were you planning on keeping a record of such a shameful face?"
        <p></p>"You looked cute, so I just took it."
        <p></p>When he said that, Mahiru pressed her lips together tightly, and her face flushed red.
        <p></p>In a quiet voice, she grumbled, "…You can have the one photo."
        <p></p>She was still wearing the white moustache as she told him that, so Amane felt his chest
        <p></p>growing warm as he held back a laugh and nodded in agreement.
        <p></p>"…Ah!"
        <p></p>Around the time they finished drinking their caffe lattes decorated with foam art, one
        <p></p>of the cats jumped up on Amane's lap.
        <p></p>It was the American shorthair that had been at the neighboring seat earlier.
        <p></p>After checking out the profile sheet, they saw that it said CACAO, FEMALE.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure whether she was friendly or just shameless, but she had suddenly
        <p></p>gotten up on his lap, which he found perplexing. He was fully aware that cats did as
        <p></p>they pleased, but he was slightly unsettled to be approached so suddenly.
        <p></p>The warmth in his lap was more profound than he had expected, as the cat confidently
        <p></p>curled up and settled in as if to say this was her spot.
        <p></p>"This one is really friendly."
        <p></p>He looked over at Mahiru as the cat sniffed at his fingers and thought she seemed
        <p></p>incredibly jealous.
        <p></p>Once Cacao had finished sniffing to her heart's content, she nuzzled her face into
        <p></p>Amane's palm, so he figured she was asking him to pet her and started scratching her
        <p></p>under her chin like he had practiced on Mahiru.
        <p></p>He could tell from the vibration and the sound that she was purring.
        <p></p>Feeling relaxed by the presence of the cute cat, Amane ruffled the fur under her chin
        <p></p>as he petted her, but he felt jealous eyes on him from Mahiru sitting next to him and
        <p></p>chuckled to himself again.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, put out your hand."
        <p></p>"Huh? R-right."
        <p></p>She obediently stretched out her hand, so Amane removed his own hand from Cacao
        <p></p>and, in its place, put Mahiru's palm near Cacao's face.
        <p></p>This cat is probably friendly and used to humans, so she ought to allow herself to be
        <p></p>petted after a proper greeting.
        <p></p>Cacao sniffed at Mahiru's hand, then let out a somewhat listless meeeow and rubbed
        <p></p>her face against Mahiru's palm. Mahiru's eyes sparkled, overcome with emotion.
        <p></p>"Amane, she let me pet her!"
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled gleefully at Amane as she finally got to pet a cat, stroking the fur in the
        <p></p>right direction.
        <p></p>Perhaps a sign of how carefully the cats were looked after, Cacao's fur was shiny and
        <p></p>incredibly soft. She didn't smell bad, either, and had just a faint hint of cat odor. She
        <p></p>was obviously treasured dearly by the staff.
        <p></p>All the cats had nice coats and looked healthy, and there weren't any that were
        <p></p>extremely fat or too thin. And all the lively cats were free to move about as they pleased.
        <p></p>"…So cute."
        <p></p>"They really are, aren't they?… I'm jealous of you, Amane…"
        <p></p>"How about you call Cacao over to you? Tell her to come sit in your lap."
        <p></p>The cats couldn't understand words, but gestures seemed to communicate surprisingly
        <p></p>well.
        <p></p>As a test, Mahiru patted her lap and called "Come here," and Cacao meowed once, then
        <p></p>slowly moved over to sit on the offered spot.
        <p></p>Mahiru's expression of excitement at that moment was so full of joy that just seeing it
        <p></p>was enough to make Amane happy, too.
        <p></p>"Look, she sat on me!"
        <p></p>"That's great. Hey, she wants you to pet her."
        <p></p>Cacao must have preferred Mahiru's soft lap over Amane's hard one, for she meowed
        <p></p>even louder than before and pushed her face into Mahiru's palm.
        <p></p>Smiling at the beaming Mahiru, who was rubbing the cat to her heart's content, Amane
        <p></p>captured the moment with his smartphone.
        <p></p>"Is this photo all right?"
        <p></p>"…This one's okay," Mahiru said as she stroked Cacao.
        <p></p>Amane kept smiling at her and stood up.
        <p></p>Along the wall were bookshelves filled with magazines and comics, so he intended to
        <p></p>bring several of them back to the table.
        <p></p>This place was called a cat cafe , but that didn't mean one would constantly be playing
        <p></p>with cats. His main goal was to spend a comfortable time in a space where there were
        <p></p>cats around, so relaxing with some reading material was also an option.
        <p></p>While Mahiru was absorbed in petting Cacao, Amane chose something to read from
        <p></p>the shelves without much thought. That was when he noticed that Silky, the cat that
        <p></p>had greeted Mahiru when they first came in, was at his feet.
        <p></p>He crouched down and put his index finger near her nose, and as expected, she sniffed
        <p></p>him in greeting.
        <p></p>This gesture was quite adorable, so his cheeks softened into another smile as he
        <p></p>watched her fondly. When she was done smelling him, Silky lifted a front paw and
        <p></p>leaned against him, as if she was going to leap into his arms.
        <p></p>Silky meowed in a higher pitch than Cacao and touched him again, so Amane sat crosslegged on the floor.
        <p></p>The cat had a high-class aura but seemed to be comfortable around people, and she
        <p></p>was allowing him to pet her. When he tried stroking her, she put on a very satisfied
        <p></p>expression.
        <p></p>She was purring and nuzzling him, so he took that as a sign that she wanted him to pet
        <p></p>her more. In accordance with the wishes of the noble Lady Silky, he gently and carefully
        <p></p>stroked her back.
        <p></p>There was a cat at Itsuki's house, so he understood how to do the petting. He watched
        <p></p>Silky carefully and adjusted his motions to keep her happy and docile.
        <p></p>So cute…
        <p></p>He could feel her purring, and another gentle smile soon slipped onto his lips. At first,
        <p></p>she had behaved a bit coldly, so he hadn't expected her to be so permissive and fawning.
        <p></p>Now that I think about it, she's kind of like Mahiru.
        <p></p>Mahiru had also been cold and standoffish at first, but once she let her guard down,
        <p></p>she started gazing at him with trust in her eyes, fawning over him, and getting
        <p></p>comfortable. In that way, she had reminded him of a cat.
        <p></p>Inwardly bestowing Silky with the moniker Angel Two, Amane enjoyed petting her.
        <p></p>Suddenly, he heard the sound of a camera shutter. He looked up and saw that Mahiru
        <p></p>had approached without him noticing and taken a picture with her smartphone.
        <p></p>"I thought you were taking a while… So you made friends with Silky, huh?"
        <p></p>"I don't know why, but she came over to see me."
        <p></p>"You're so stingy… I want to pet her, too…"
        <p></p>"What happened to Cacao?"
        <p></p>"Cats have a mind of their own…"
        <p></p>Apparently, the cat had gone off somewhere.
        <p></p>He looked around the cafe and saw Cacao curled up on the second story of a cat tower.
        <p></p>Just a moment ago, she had been sitting with Mahiru, but she must have changed her
        <p></p>mind.
        <p></p>"Is Silky your favorite, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Well, I haven't petted all of them yet to really start comparing… But yeah, she kind of
        <p></p>resembles you, so I'd like to keep petting her."
        <p></p>"Resembles me?"
        <p></p>"I mean, you were pretty standoffish at first, kind of cold and blunt, but once you
        <p></p>decided you liked me, you warmed up quickly."
        <p></p>Sure, it was catlike for her to let her guard down and fawn on him, but he thought that
        <p></p>the way she trusted him and relished his attention was more doglike, so he thought of
        <p></p>her as a cross between a cat and dog.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem to realize just how badly she was spoiling him, which made Amane
        <p></p>feel happy yet embarrassed at the same time.
        <p></p>"…I am not a cat. Besides, it's not like I get attached to just anyone."
        <p></p>"Well, that's because you're very wary."
        <p></p>"…You haven't been thinking of me as a cat?"
        <p></p>"I haven't, I haven't," he answered, stroking the cat in his lap the same way he always
        <p></p>patted Mahiru. "Right?" he sought Silky's agreement.
        <p></p>Either she was good at reading the room, or it was just a coincidence, but Silky
        <p></p>meowed, right on cue so even Mahiru couldn't press the matter any further.
        <p></p>But Mahiru looked at him with a fairly dissatisfied expression, so Amane used his
        <p></p>unoccupied left hand to stroke Mahiru's head.
        <p></p>"…So you do think of me as a cat."
        <p></p>"Sort of. Here, how about you play with Silky? It looks like they'll lend you some toys
        <p></p>if you go to the front desk."
        <p></p>"You're not getting out of this that easily."
        <p></p>"…So you don't want to play with her, then?" he asked as he teased the cat.
        <p></p>Mahiru pouted slightly and grumbled "You don't play fair, Amane," then headed for the
        <p></p>front desk to borrow some cat toys.
        <p></p>Amane had been planning to switch places with her and go to the desk himself, so he
        <p></p>watched her with wide eyes, then tilted his head in confusion as he recalled Mahiru's
        <p></p>expression, which had been a little sulky for some reason.
        <p></p>"What does that mean, I don't play fair?… Is she talking about playing with Silky?" He
        <p></p>muttered as he pondered the reason for Mahiru's sour expression, but the cat just
        <p></p>meowed as if to say "How should I know?" and nestled its head in his palm again.
        <p></p>Ultimately, the reason for Mahiru's pouting wasn't really clear, but as she played with
        <p></p>the cats, her mood quickly improved, and she was soon smiling at him again.
        <p></p>After a certain point, Mahiru stopped paying attention to Amane and focused entirely
        <p></p>on the cats. He smiled wryly as he watched her play, but for some reason, the cats kept
        <p></p>settling into Amane's lap.
        <p></p>Mahiru saw this and started sulking again, but Silky, as if to say "There's no helping it,"
        <p></p>moved over to sit on Mahiru's thighs, and all was well again.
        <p></p>There must have been something about Amane that the cats appreciated, because as
        <p></p>he was petting them, even though he had no treats to give, other cats continued to
        <p></p>swarm around him.
        <p></p>Eventually, though, they reached the end of their allotted time in the cafe . The two of
        <p></p>them used lint rollers to remove cat hair from their clothes and washed their hands,
        <p></p>and as Amane finished, Mahiru went to get the bill, then looked at him with
        <p></p>dissatisfaction.
        <p></p>"Why are you making that face?" he asked.
        <p></p>"You didn't have to go to the trouble of doing that."
        <p></p>"It's no trouble. It's for my own satisfaction, so don't worry about it." Amane had gone
        <p></p>ahead and paid for everything already, so she didn't have to. "Actually, think of it as my
        <p></p>way of saying thanks for coming with me to a cat cafe , a place I never would have gone
        <p></p>into alone. Okay?"
        <p></p>"…But—"
        <p></p>"Let me treat you in situations like this. If you don't agree, then… All right, how about
        <p></p>coming with me again to make it even?"
        <p></p>"…I can't do anything but agree to that, can I?"
        <p></p>"Well, I'm for this plan, too, so it's a win-win. No problem!"
        <p></p>Mahiru pressed her lips together tightly and nudged Amane's upper arm, then
        <p></p>squeezed Amane's hand again.
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru had lunch at a restaurant they had picked out in advance, one with
        <p></p>a good reputation, before heading to the shopping mall. It was a popular restaurant,
        <p></p>and as expected, the food was tasty, just like the reviews reported. Perhaps it was a
        <p></p>simple matter of opinion, but Amane still thought Mahiru's cooking edged out ahead,
        <p></p>confirming once more that hers was the very best.
        <p></p>Seeing as how it was Golden Week, there were quite a few more customers in the mall
        <p></p>than there might have been on a typical weekday, so gripping tightly onto Mahiru's
        <p></p>hand, Amane stopped beside a wall so they could figure out where they wanted to go
        <p></p>before diving into the crowds.
        <p></p>"So then, what will we do in the mall? You mentioned shopping, but is there something
        <p></p>in particular you want to buy?"
        <p></p>"N-nothing specific, but um, I thought it sounded fun to have a look around together…
        <p></p>I-is that all right?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, that's fine. I'm good with window-shopping."
        <p></p>At home, he had often been dragged around by his mother, and his family would also
        <p></p>sometimes go out shopping, so he had built up a tolerance to an activity that some
        <p></p>found fairly agonizing.
        <p></p>Besides, it wouldn't be a bad idea to get a look at some things that Mahiru wanted to
        <p></p>see.
        <p></p>"Where do you want to start? There are all sorts of shops—variety goods, clothes,
        <p></p>interior decorating…"
        <p></p>This enormous shopping complex had an almost uncountable number of clothing and
        <p></p>accessory stores, restaurants, variety shops, and entertainment facilities all crammed
        <p></p>in wall-to-wall; so many stores over such a wide area that they couldn't possibly see it
        <p></p>all in one day. Since it would be impossible to look around the entire mall, he had to
        <p></p>get her to provide at least some direction.
        <p></p>"All right… Can we start with clothes?"
        <p></p>"Sure. You buying a new outfit?"
        <p></p>"I want to buy something, if there's anything good. They've got this summer's styles
        <p></p>out, so I'd like to get some new clothes."
        <p></p>"Summer, huh…? That came quickly."
        <p></p>The sweaty season was about to start, but even so, it was still the time of year when
        <p></p>the sunlight was warm and cheerful, so he thought it was a bit hasty to switch over to
        <p></p>summer clothes just yet. The stores, of course, had to anticipate the approaching
        <p></p>season, but still, Amane couldn't shake the springtime feeling.
        <p></p>"This summer… Uh, you'll be coming home with me… will you?"
        <p></p>"Ah y-yes. If it's all right with you and your parents, that is." She seemed to remember
        <p></p>the earlier conversation about coming with him to his parents' home the next time he
        <p></p>went, and she nodded eagerly.
        <p></p>"I asked my mom once more after we talked, and she said you're definitely welcome.
        <p></p>Actually, she insisted I bring you."
        <p></p>His parents would probably agree to let her stay even if he didn't check with them first,
        <p></p>but they would have to get a room ready and everything, so he had made sure to ask
        <p></p>ahead, and they'd promised to give her a warm welcome.
        <p></p>He was certain to hear complaints from his mother if he showed up without her, so he
        <p></p>was grateful for Mahiru's enthusiasm.
        <p></p>"Well, my hometown's not that impressive, you know. Although, I guess there's plenty
        <p></p>to do."
        <p></p>"Really?"
        <p></p>"Well, my mother never had trouble finding a new place to drag me. There's a shopping
        <p></p>mall like this one, a ridiculously huge wilderness park, a stupidly large water park, just
        <p></p>general stuff like that."
        <p></p>Amane's hometown was in a nice, central location, not too urban and not too rural, so
        <p></p>it was a place where people wouldn't get bored in the summer or winter. Far from it,
        <p></p>there were so many things to do that it was a distinct danger to be dragged around
        <p></p>from place to place and not have any time to be alone.
        <p></p>The water park would be open in the summer, so it would feel really nice to go on the
        <p></p>slides and swim around and relax. There was also a large water park in the area where
        <p></p>they were living now, so they could probably also go swim there right after the start
        <p></p>of summer vacation.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't especially good at sports, but he didn't have anything against being
        <p></p>active. He liked to swim, so it would probably be nice to go by himself, too. There was
        <p></p>no way that he could tell Mahiru he'd like to go to the pool with her, because the
        <p></p>invitation would sound too much like he had an obvious ulterior motive.
        <p></p>"Swimming is optional at our school, so if you don't take it, you don't get the chance to
        <p></p>swim, so it might be nice to go swimming. If you want to, you could go with my mom…
        <p></p>Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Uh, no, it's nothing…"
        <p></p>"Ah, don't worry. I'm not thinking that I want to see you in a swimsuit or anything rude
        <p></p>like that."
        <p></p>"I d-didn't think you were. A p-pool, huh?"
        <p></p>"Is there something wrong with that?"
        <p></p>Amane always thought of swimming pools in the summertime, and not in a weird way
        <p></p>or anything, but Mahiru shook her head with slightly stiff movements.
        <p></p>"W-well… umm…"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"A-as long as I don't have to swim, um… I could consider going…"
        <p></p>"…Is it possible that you don't know how to swim?"
        <p></p>She blatantly refused to meet his eyes. Apparently, he had been right on the money.
        <p></p>"…I honestly thought you could do literally anything."
        <p></p>"O-of course I can't do everything. Swimming is optional, so I thought I could get by
        <p></p>without telling anyone."
        <p></p>Her face was turning redder by the second. She was obviously embarrassed.
        <p></p>"I don't know what to say; I didn't expect that…"
        <p></p>"Th-that's enough about swimming already, isn't it? Come on, let's go."
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem to want him to dwell on the fact that she couldn't swim, and with
        <p></p>a very red face, she tugged at his hand. Well, not exactly tugged—she pressed her body
        <p></p>against his arm and squeezed it tightly. It was clear she was trying to push him to get
        <p></p>started with their window-shopping because she wanted to avoid the topic, but she
        <p></p>couldn't find any traction.
        <p></p>All the fabric on the clothes in the shops was more lightweight, to match the changing
        <p></p>seasons as the weather gradually got warmer. The chiffon blouse Mahiru had on that
        <p></p>day, for example, was very light and thin, and it had a wide collar, exposing much of
        <p></p>her neck and shoulders. And Amane discovered at this moment that he was at just the
        <p></p>right angle to see directly down the front of her undershirt.
        <p></p>But he had a feeling that if he pointed that out right now, she would run away in a huff,
        <p></p>so instead he kept his mouth shut and gently extracted his arm from Mahiru's grasp,
        <p></p>then firmly took her by the hand.
        <p></p>Frankly, he wouldn't have minded being able to enjoy the view for a little while longer,
        <p></p>but his feelings of guilt took over and internally he derided himself for being a
        <p></p>spineless loser.
        <p></p>"I hear you, I hear you. Don't run; you'll fall."
        <p></p>"…I'm not a child."
        <p></p>Mahiru thankfully turned away, apparently unaware of Amane's agitation, and Amane,
        <p></p>too, turned to look outside, hoping to escape her gaze for a bit.
        <p></p>Desperately trying to drive the lingering feeling of that softness pressing up against
        <p></p>his arm out of his mind, Amane sighed quietly enough that Mahiru couldn't hear.
        <p></p>Amane gazed down the long row of shops as Mahiru tugged him along by the hand,
        <p></p>but once again, all he could think about was how much attention she attracted.
        <p></p>She possessed a simple and clean beauty that befitted her nickname of "the angel." But
        <p></p>right now, Mahiru was exuding an aura of carefree joy that made him want to wrap his
        <p></p>arms around her.
        <p></p>In angel mode, Mahiru had the beauty and ephemerality of a painting and made
        <p></p>onlookers feel like she must not be touched or interfered with. However, that was a
        <p></p>fragile, artificial kind of beauty, and Amane knew it wasn't who she really was. The girl
        <p></p>holding his hand was wearing a genuine, carefree smile and brimming with life.
        <p></p>Without her even saying a word, he could tell from her expression and the way she
        <p></p>held his hand, and even the way she walked, that she was having a lot of fun.
        <p></p>Her usual restrained smile was beautiful, too, but he thought she looked much cuter
        <p></p>when she let her feelings show on her face and smiled with her whole being, rather
        <p></p>than keeping it all bottled up.
        <p></p>"…Is something the matter?" she suddenly asked.
        <p></p>"No," he answered. "I was just thinking that we get a lot of stares when we're walking
        <p></p>together."
        <p></p>Both men and women were turning to look at them as they passed, which really drove
        <p></p>home the reality of Mahiru's beauty.
        <p></p>"…I don't think I'm the only one they're looking at, you know?"
        <p></p>"Well, I'm sure some of them are taking the time to size up the guy escorting you."
        <p></p>"That's not what I mean, geez!"
        <p></p>She looked up at him with disappointment but didn't seem inclined to elaborate, only
        <p></p>squeezing his hand tightly again. He heard her mumble quietly, "His self-esteem is a
        <p></p>real problem…"
        <p></p>But Amane knew that if he was with Mahiru, he would be under strict scrutiny, and it
        <p></p>was also obvious that he could never compare favorably to her, so this wasn't really an
        <p></p>issue of self-esteem or anything like that, as far as he was concerned.
        <p></p>"All right, listen up," Mahiru said. "I'll try to say this as frankly as possible so you can
        <p></p>understand."
        <p></p>"Huh? What's with that voice? Scary."
        <p></p>"How rude…" She pressed on his nose with her index finger and silenced him. "This is
        <p></p>your own fault, you know?"
        <p></p>But instead of pouting, Mahiru wore a teasing smile as she repeatedly poked at
        <p></p>Amane's nose, then pulled away once satisfied and tugged on Amane's hand. Actually,
        <p></p>it would be more accurate to say she pressed up against his arm again.
        <p></p>"…Things would move along a lot faster if you just had a little confidence," Mahiru
        <p></p>grumbled, putting her forehead against his upper arm.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't stand it. He had to look away.
        <p></p>…It's not on purpose; she doesn't mean it.
        <p></p>Amane was trying not to think about the softness pressed up against him. He tried to
        <p></p>politely open up some distance between them, but Mahiru clutched his arm as if to tell
        <p></p>him not to go anywhere.
        <p></p>He shuddered, thinking that if this was all intentional, she was acting like quite the
        <p></p>little devil. But he was convinced she wasn't aware of what she was doing, so he
        <p></p>shuddered for a different reason.
        <p></p>If things continued this way, he was going to blow his top, so Amane somehow turned
        <p></p>his conscious mind to other things and took an easy look around at the area. Exactly
        <p></p>when he needed it, he spotted a store lined with racks of understated clothes that
        <p></p>Mahiru might like.
        <p></p>"Hey, the clothes on that mannequin seem like they would suit you. Want to go take a
        <p></p>look?"
        <p></p>He pointed out the shop with his free hand, hoping to divert attention from the fire
        <p></p>currently searing his cheeks, and Mahiru asked, "Are those the sorts of clothes you like,
        <p></p>Amane?" She seemed interested, so their feet naturally led them toward the shop.
        <p></p>"How about this one?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, well, you look good in everything, but something like this does seems like it
        <p></p>would suit you in particular."
        <p></p>The mannequin was dressed in an off-the-shoulder dress with thin stripes on a white
        <p></p>field. It was summer clothing, so the fabric was fairly thin, and the shoulders were
        <p></p>exposed. It looked cool and comfortable for warm-weather outings.
        <p></p>This style of clothing looked really good on women who were slender and had pretty
        <p></p>de colletage, so he was sure it would look great on Mahiru. He mentally dressed her in
        <p></p>the outfit as she stood there next to the mannequin and was immediately able to
        <p></p>imagine her looking light and breezy in it. It was a look that would go well with a straw
        <p></p>hat.
        <p></p>"I'll just go try it on, okay?"
        <p></p>Mahiru picked up one of the same from a rack of dresses hanging next to the
        <p></p>mannequin, as if she had either decided quickly or had always been planning to try it
        <p></p>on.
        <p></p>Amane was a bit taken aback by her sudden enthusiasm. He accepted the bag she
        <p></p>entrusted to him, and she immediately disappeared into the fitting room.
        <p></p>He waited for Mahiru to change clothes, baffled by her excitement, and ended up even
        <p></p>more baffled because for some reason he kept finding himself on the receiving end of
        <p></p>warm looks from people nearby. It wasn't just the store clerk—the other customers
        <p></p>were smiling at him pleasantly, which made Amane extremely uncomfortable.
        <p></p>As he waited for Mahiru, he wished from the bottom of his heart that she would return
        <p></p>soon. Finally, the fitting room curtain opened, and Mahiru stepped out.
        <p></p>But she hadn't changed into the dress.
        <p></p>"Welcome back… You didn't put it on?"
        <p></p>"No, I put it on and checked the size. But… Well, I can't show it to you right now,
        <p></p>because I don't have on the right underwear…"
        <p></p>"S-sorry I asked."
        <p></p>The chiffon blouse she was currently wearing also showed a fair amount of cleavage,
        <p></p>but not as much as an off-the-shoulder dress. It sounded like she needed to have on
        <p></p>different underthings than usual when wearing clothes that exposed so much
        <p></p>shoulder, so she wasn't ready to immediately show him the dress.
        <p></p>"But you were kind enough to point out that it would suit me, and I put it on and liked
        <p></p>it, so I'm buying it."
        <p></p>She took her bag back from him and went to the register with the dress in her arms,
        <p></p>so Amane followed her in a fluster.
        <p></p>He started fishing his wallet out, thinking he ought to pay for it, since he was the one
        <p></p>who said it would suit Mahiru, but she stopped him as she was already groping around
        <p></p>in her own bag.
        <p></p>"You can't pay. I need to buy this myself and show it off to you."
        <p></p>"O-oh."
        <p></p>"Though I won't be able to wear it until it gets warmer. I'll hold on to it until summer.
        <p></p>You can look forward to seeing it."
        <p></p>She looked bashful as she finished paying, and Amane shut his mouth tight and tried
        <p></p>desperately to resist the urge to collapse on the spot.
        <p></p>Dammit, she's saying such ridiculously cute things. It sounds like she's saying she's going
        <p></p>to wear it just for me. My heart can't take this.
        <p></p>He caught the eye of the store clerk who was taking Mahiru's payment, and she smiled
        <p></p>at him with a truly friendly expression, so Amane couldn't do anything but bite his lip
        <p></p>and avert his eyes.
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru had enjoyed window-shopping together—actually, since they'd
        <p></p>made a purchase, it was more accurate to just call it shopping at this point—but
        <p></p>Amane had temporarily split off from Mahiru and was on his own.
        <p></p>That was because Mahiru had gone to buy something she wanted to check out on her
        <p></p>own and said she needed to be alone for a bit. This outing had been Mahiru's suggestion
        <p></p>to begin with, and Amane figured that girls had all sorts of shopping that they wouldn't
        <p></p>want other people to know about, so he readily parted ways and went over to a pillar
        <p></p>near the mall fountain they'd designated as a meeting place.
        <p></p>Amane was plenty used to accompanying women on marathon shopping trips thanks
        <p></p>to his mother, and he was also accustomed to waiting for them when they dragged him
        <p></p>around places. At the end of the day, he didn't dislike waiting quietly by himself, so he
        <p></p>did just that, without the slightest shred of irritation.
        <p></p>The staring decreased after he split off from Mahiru, which made him a little more
        <p></p>comfortable, and this intermission was just what he needed to give his overburdened
        <p></p>heart a brief rest.
        <p></p>…She's so adorable and keeps touching me. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on…
        <p></p>Mahiru was showing a side of herself she usually held back. She was joyful and
        <p></p>genuine and unspeakably charming.
        <p></p>Mahiru must have been perfectly aware of just how extraordinary her appearance
        <p></p>was, but she also seemed indifferent to her own beauty. Maybe it was because Amane
        <p></p>treated her as a friend and didn't make a big deal about it, but she didn't make a fuss
        <p></p>about her looks in front of him, and she let him see her natural cuteness, smell her
        <p></p>sweetness, feel her softness, and so much more. Amane knew he was extremely lucky
        <p></p>to be able to enjoy her company like that, but he felt too guilty to really appreciate it.
        <p></p>He was racked with shame just remembering it all, but he couldn't let it show in public,
        <p></p>so he drew his lips in tight and quietly closed his eyes.
        <p></p>All these thoughts were making him restless, so he shook his head slowly to drive them
        <p></p>from his mind.
        <p></p>Suddenly, Amane heard a high-pitched voice from close by. "Um, excuse me."
        <p></p>His eyes snapped open at the sound of an unfamiliar voice, and he looked forward to
        <p></p>see two girls smiling at him. They were probably about college age. At least, they
        <p></p>looked older than him. They were dressed stylishly for a Golden Week outing and
        <p></p>smiling at Amane, who had his eyes narrowed suspiciously.
        <p></p>"Excuse me, are you alone? Do you have some free time?"
        <p></p>He was astonished to hear the girls ask him that.
        <p></p>He would have thought that, with his head hung low, it would have been obvious he
        <p></p>didn't want to talk to anybody, so it shocked him that these girls were so bold. It was
        <p></p>unfortunate that they seemed to have no eye for quality.
        <p></p>Even as suspicions flickered through Amane's mind about why these girls would have
        <p></p>gone out of their way to come talk to him, when he wasn't even that nicely put together,
        <p></p>he knew it would be rude to ignore them entirely, so he went ahead and looked at them
        <p></p>with a bland expression.
        <p></p>"No, I'm waiting for someone."
        <p></p>He was hoping they would infer the situation from all the women-oriented brands
        <p></p>emblazoned on the many shopping bags Mahiru had left with him, but the girls didn't
        <p></p>seem to notice. Perhaps the bags didn't stand out because of their simple designs.
        <p></p>"I appreciate the invitation, but I've got a previous engagement, so—"
        <p></p>"In that case, your friend can come with us, too! We'll get tea or something."
        <p></p>They seemed to have decided that the friend he was waiting for was another guy.
        <p></p>If he and Mahiru had been dating, he could tell them he was waiting for his girlfriend
        <p></p>and easily turn them away with that one word, but he and Mahiru weren't actually
        <p></p>dating, and she wasn't here with him at the moment, so if he claimed she was his
        <p></p>girlfriend, he didn't know whether she would quickly back him up when she actually
        <p></p>did reappear.
        <p></p>Besides, he had once used that excuse to get her away from a drunk guy, and Mahiru
        <p></p>had told him to stop saying it, so he hesitated to use it again on his own.
        <p></p>He frowned slightly as he regarded the two girls, figuring he was probably stuck
        <p></p>talking to them until he reunited with Mahiru—then, out of the corner of his eye, he
        <p></p>spied some familiar flaxen hair.
        <p></p>"Sorry for making you wait."
        <p></p>Several seconds later, swinging her hair gently to the side and approaching with easy
        <p></p>movements, his savior, the angel, appeared.
        <p></p>She seemed to have seen that Amane was in trouble and had come quickly. Her
        <p></p>breathing was a little too fast for having just walked.
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled lightly at Amane, who had been trying to weather the waves of the girls'
        <p></p>chatter with a stoic face, and practically leaped into his arms.
        <p></p>By some stroke of luck, he managed to not let it show on his face, but Amane was
        <p></p>startled beyond belief. Mahiru was looking up at him with her body angled just right
        <p></p>so he couldn't see the girls behind her. He could sense amazement and dissatisfaction
        <p></p>in her eyes and the unspoken question of "What are you doing?" all of which he
        <p></p>recognized as a performance to help Amane extract himself from the situation.
        <p></p>…She's making me super nervous; I wish she'd stop.
        <p></p>This was all Amane's fault—he didn't want to hurt their feelings, but his indecision
        <p></p>had been mistaken for an invitation to keep chatting him up. And Mahiru had arrived
        <p></p>to rescue him, so he definitely couldn't complain about her methods. But he couldn't
        <p></p>deny it was still stressing him out.
        <p></p>Amane joined the charade by gently placing his hand on her back. It was a very
        <p></p>intimate move to show they had a special relationship.
        <p></p>"Don't worry about it," he said. "These nice girls were kind enough to keep me
        <p></p>company, so it didn't feel like that long."
        <p></p>"Oh really? Thank you for going to the trouble."
        <p></p>Mahiru half turned around with a beaming smile, and the girls looked at her in blank
        <p></p>amazement. The boy they had been trying to pick up was embracing a girl who seemed
        <p></p>like his girlfriend. On top of that, she was incredibly cute.
        <p></p>Mahiru must have realized why the girls were frozen in place, but her expression was
        <p></p>full of good will, as if she had no idea. Amane was awestruck by her apparent
        <p></p>magnanimity. She really did appear grateful, and her smile was the picture of innocence.
        <p></p>But the girls just stared at them, without moving an inch. Amane smiled back, trying
        <p></p>his best to act casual. "I'm sorry. Like I said before, I have a prior engagement, so…"
        <p></p>Amane was relieved he'd given them that excuse earlier. He tapped on Mahiru's back
        <p></p>impatiently, and Mahiru, who was still wearing a divine smile, entwined her arm with
        <p></p>his, seemingly in good spirits.
        <p></p>She was nestled very close to him again, and the breathless feeling in his chest returned,
        <p></p>but he knew he couldn't allow himself to get flustered now. Not after Mahiru had gone
        <p></p>to the trouble of putting on this act for him. So he feigned calm and bowed to the girls.
        <p></p>Mahiru followed his lead and bowed, too, then at her urging, they turned and walked
        <p></p>away from the girls.
        <p></p>Once they had turned a corner and checked to make sure they couldn't be seen, Amane
        <p></p>looked at Mahiru and saw her fake smile disappear.
        <p></p>"What were you doing?" she asked in a tone of voice that was suddenly flat and
        <p></p>detached as she looked up at him.
        <p></p>Without meaning to, Amane chuckled at the suddenness of her transformation. She
        <p></p>was still clinging tightly to him, but her expression looked weary and slightly
        <p></p>displeased. She had seemed to be in a good mood earlier, but that had evidently been
        <p></p>part of the act, for now shades of ill humor were flashing across her eyes.
        <p></p>"You really saved me back there," Amane said.
        <p></p>"I take my eyes off you for one second… Really, I was only gone for a short while.
        <p></p>Unbelievable. I wouldn't have left you alone if I knew this would happen…" Mahiru was
        <p></p>muttering to herself.
        <p></p>With a sudden rush of guilt, Amane noticed his gaze had drifted lower and lower over
        <p></p>Mahiru's body. He seemed to be the only one who was agitated by the close contact—
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem to be paying it any mind.
        <p></p>"You really don't know how to tell a stranger off, do you, Amane?" Mahiru didn't show
        <p></p>any sign of being aware of Amane's internal turmoil. She just looked exasperated.
        <p></p>"Maybe I can't turn them down, or maybe I just don't know how to handle that type of
        <p></p>stranger. They were girls, so I didn't want to act rough or use strong language. I
        <p></p>wouldn't know what to do if I made them cry or something."
        <p></p>"Honestly, I don't know whether you're gentlemanly or a total loser."
        <p></p>"Hey, shut up, that was the first time something like that has ever happened to me, so
        <p></p>I couldn't help it. I never would've imagined in a million years that girls would come
        <p></p>over and talk to me."
        <p></p>Amane never would have thought, with so many people hanging around, that someone
        <p></p>would talk to him of all people.
        <p></p>"Assertive girls are incredible, huh? They even approach antisocial guys like me."
        <p></p>"…The way you look now isn't really antisocial… If anything, you look more like a fresh,
        <p></p>friendly young man."
        <p></p>"Those are very nice words that don't describe me at all."
        <p></p>"Well, a makeover can only go so far…"
        <p></p>"How nice of you to say."
        <p></p>Mahiru was right—even if he looked a little nicer on the outside, there could be no
        <p></p>mistake that inside he was as gloomy as ever. Amane laughed despite himself.
        <p></p>This straightforward way of speaking was also one of the things he appreciated about
        <p></p>Mahiru. He found it very endearing. It was far preferable to being lied to.
        <p></p>He knew she definitely was not intending to disparage him, so he accepted her words
        <p></p>with a gentle understanding.
        <p></p>But Mahiru sighed for some reason. "Okay, I suppose I have to just tell you outright.
        <p></p>You're definitely not bright or cheerful, but I wouldn't say you're gloomy, either. To me,
        <p></p>you seem calm and composed, and when I'm with you, I feel calm, too. Like I can relax.
        <p></p>Even if we're not talking, I feel comfortable when I'm by your side, and I think that's
        <p></p>wonderful."
        <p></p>"…Oh, you do?"
        <p></p>Her compliments were embarrassing, and Amane could only manage a short reply.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem satisfied, though. She pressed against his arm again, seemingly
        <p></p>unaware of how weak it made him.
        <p></p>"And how do you feel when you're with me?"
        <p></p>"…At home, I feel calm."
        <p></p>"And now?"
        <p></p>"…Now I can't relax at all. Because someone keeps pressing her chest up against me."
        <p></p>That must have been completely unexpected, and she must have been completely
        <p></p>unaware of what she was doing, because Mahiru froze stiff and looked down at her
        <p></p>own chest.
        <p></p>And then her face turned red with such force she looked like a boiling kettle.
        <p></p>"I thought you were doing it on purpose."
        <p></p>When he joked that she had been causing him terrible distress, to the point it bordered
        <p></p>on harassment, she glared up at him with slightly teary eyes. It didn't have the slightest
        <p></p>impact, probably because he knew she was doing it to hide her embarrassment.
        <p></p>"Wha—? Y-you dummy, I would never!"
        <p></p>"I know that. I was joking, sorry."
        <p></p>He knew that if he teased her too much she would start sulking, so he apologized
        <p></p>quickly to defuse the bomb. Mahiru's raging emotions now extinguished, she grumbled
        <p></p>only a small complaint. But she didn't really have anything more to say and instead
        <p></p>settled on punching him once in the side to vent her anger.
        <p></p>Smiling at her obvious frustration, Amane took hold of her hand again to make sure
        <p></p>there was some space between them.
        <p></p>"Don't cling to me so closely."
        <p></p>"…Can we still hold hands?"
        <p></p>"I'll lose you if we don't."
        <p></p>If they let go of each other and got lost in the Golden Week crowds, it would defeat the
        <p></p>purpose of going out together in the first place.
        <p></p>"…What would you do if you lost me?"
        <p></p>"I would use my phone to contact you and pick a place to meet up, like normal."
        <p></p>"How pragmatic."
        <p></p>"Guess so. Well, I'll try not to let you go."
        <p></p>If he let her slip from his grasp and made her wander around by herself, Mahiru was
        <p></p>far more likely to get hit on, so he didn't intend to let her look like she was alone.
        <p></p>Mahiru had specifically requested this outing and probably wanted to enjoy a pleasant
        <p></p>day rather than being hounded by people she had no interest in. Besides, even though
        <p></p>Amane knew Mahiru was often approached by other guys, he didn't have to like it.
        <p></p>At Amane's words, Mahiru stared deeply into his eyes, then lowered her gaze to their
        <p></p>joined hands. And then her lips curved softly into a smile, and in a voice as gentle as a
        <p></p>blooming flower, she said, "…Yes. Please don't let me go."
        <p></p>She whispered quietly and entwined her fingers with his. Trying not to let her sense
        <p></p>his sudden panic, Amane responded in kind.
        <p></p>"…So this is a game center…"
        <p></p>After they finished at the clothing stores and variety shops and had made a few
        <p></p>purchases, Amane led Mahiru to his favorite arcade.
        <p></p>Coming here had been her idea. They had put this place last on their list of destinations;
        <p></p>so even if they won prizes at the crane games, they wouldn't have to carry them around
        <p></p>everywhere. After this, they were going straight home, so they had plenty of time.
        <p></p>Finishing the day here had undoubtedly been the right call.
        <p></p>Apparently, Mahiru had never come here with Chitose, either, and she looked adorable,
        <p></p>marveling at everything around her.
        <p></p>"There really are all sorts of games here, huh?"
        <p></p>"Sure are. Not just crane games but arcade games and physical games, too. This game
        <p></p>center has a ton of different types."
        <p></p>"I can see that. And it's super loud."
        <p></p>"Ah, most places like this are."
        <p></p>Mahiru was frowning a little, reminding Amane that the cacophony typical of game
        <p></p>centers could be grating to the ears for someone not accustomed to it. He was used to
        <p></p>this ambience, so he was fine.
        <p></p>The section with slots and arcade games was even louder, so he weaved his way
        <p></p>around those areas as he walked through the game center with Mahiru following
        <p></p>behind him.
        <p></p>"So what'll you play?"
        <p></p>"I want to try a crane game. I want to try winning a stuffed animal."
        <p></p>Her sights seemed to be set on the crane games. She looked around that section of the
        <p></p>game center, alternately squeezing and releasing his hand in her excitement.
        <p></p>It was Golden Week, so the game center had gotten a lot of new prizes and had stocked
        <p></p>plenty of cute stuffed animals that were more family-oriented, so there were plenty
        <p></p>that Mahiru would probably like.
        <p></p>"…Amane, I want to get that one."
        <p></p>"Hmm, which one?"
        <p></p>"That one. That cat… Don't you think it looks like Silky?"
        <p></p>The toy Mahiru was pointing at was a cat with white fur that turned dark brown
        <p></p>around its face. With its blue eyes, it did indeed resemble Silky, the cat who had first
        <p></p>greeted Mahiru at the cat cafe , and she seemed enamored by it.
        <p></p>"It really does look like her. You want it?"
        <p></p>"I do. Can I try?"
        <p></p>"Sure. I think the machines here are easy to win, but if you can't get it, I'll get it for
        <p></p>you."
        <p></p>"I'll try my best so you don't have to."
        <p></p>Eager to take on this new challenge, Mahiru squared off against the crane game, while
        <p></p>Amane hung back and watched. If Amane was to take a turn, he could easily secure the
        <p></p>prize, but Mahiru wanted to win this one, and it was best to let her tackle the challenge
        <p></p>alone.
        <p></p>She inserted a coin and timidly pressed the first button to move the crane arm to the
        <p></p>side for just a moment, then checked its position. Typical of the prudent Mahiru, she
        <p></p>seemed to be confirming how far it would move with one press of the button.
        <p></p>But with this type of crane game, once you let go of the button, it shifted into verticalmovement mode.
        <p></p>"Wait, huh? It won't move."
        <p></p>"Sorry, I forgot to tell you. Once you let go of the button, it shifts to vertical movement,
        <p></p>so you've only got the one chance."
        <p></p>"Ah, so now…"
        <p></p>"No matter what you do, it won't reach the stuffed animals."
        <p></p>The toys were placed in the middle of a wide open space, but the arm had only barely
        <p></p>moved away from the drop chute, and all that was left to set was vertical movement.
        <p></p>No matter how Mahiru struggled, she wouldn't be able to touch the prizes.
        <p></p>This game center also had the type of crane games that were timed and used a lever
        <p></p>that could move in all directions, but this particular machine was the button type, so
        <p></p>there was unfortunately no going back. This happened to a lot of people when they
        <p></p>were first playing crane games, so there was really no getting around it.
        <p></p>"Well, that hundred yen is gone, but you still have the vertical movement, so you can
        <p></p>use this as a chance to get a feel for the speed the arm moves and the lag after you
        <p></p>release the button. Then you can use that information on your next try."
        <p></p>"Hmm… I'll do that. It's my fault for being careless," she said, then moved the arm with
        <p></p>intense concentration, paying careful attention to the speed.
        <p></p>Amane felt like he hadn't given her enough warning on her first attempt, so he quietly
        <p></p>inserted another coin, which made Mahiru look at him with dissatisfaction. Amane
        <p></p>said "It's fine" and patted her on the back for encouragement. Reluctantly, she returned
        <p></p>to her game.
        <p></p>She must have more or less figured out the speed at which the arm moved, because on
        <p></p>her next attempt, she was able to line it up laterally with the position of the stuffed
        <p></p>animals.
        <p></p>It was somewhat off-center, but she still had a chance to reach her target along the
        <p></p>vertical axis. Even if she didn't grab right in the center of the toys, considering the
        <p></p>arm's center of gravity and the force of its grip, plus the timing of when it released, she
        <p></p>could still get something.
        <p></p>Mahiru was a total beginner, but Amane was impressed with how skillfully she was
        <p></p>already playing. She carefully moved the arm along the vertical axis until it was more
        <p></p>or less above the stuffed animals, then tried to pick up the stuffed cat.
        <p></p>Her aim was good, but the toy was slightly oblong, so when the arm squeezed, the
        <p></p>center of gravity shifted immediately, and the cat fell.
        <p></p>"Hmm."
        <p></p>"Almost. Instead of trying to pick up the actual toy, it'll be easier if you move it with
        <p></p>one side of the crane arm and take advantage of its center of gravity to make it roll
        <p></p>over."
        <p></p>Luckily, the partition around the drop chute wasn't very tall, so if she could roll the cat,
        <p></p>it should fall down.
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked intently, then obediently carried out the movements as she had been
        <p></p>told.
        <p></p>One thing he appreciated about Mahiru was her ability to take advice without getting
        <p></p>angry or stubborn.
        <p></p>She made another attempt for the cat, taking into account the position of the arm and
        <p></p>the stuffed animal's center of gravity.
        <p></p>"So I'll do this here… and move the head…"
        <p></p>Mahiru's serious expression was reflected in the game cabinet's glass. Amane laughed
        <p></p>quietly so she wouldn't hear him.
        <p></p>After inserting several more coins and trying for a while, Mahiru finally moved the toy
        <p></p>into the prize chute with the crane arm.
        <p></p>She let out a quiet gasp as the stuffed cat fell with a plunk against the flap covering the
        <p></p>end of the prize chute.
        <p></p>After a moment of silence, Mahiru looked up at Amane, slightly stunned.
        <p></p>"…It fell."
        <p></p>"Yeah, good work… Look, it's proof of your victory."
        <p></p>Amane retrieved the stuffed animal she had fought so hard for and held it out to
        <p></p>Mahiru. The reality that she had finally won the prize seemed to be sinking in. Right
        <p></p>before his eyes, an expression of delight transformed her beautiful features.
        <p></p>"I—I got it. I got it, Amane!"
        <p></p>"You sure did. You did great for your first time."
        <p></p>He patted her head for a job well done, and she squinted in embarrassment and tightly
        <p></p>embraced her prize, the stuffed cat that closely resembled Silky.
        <p></p>She seemed especially happy that she had won the toy by herself and smiled in
        <p></p>satisfaction as she rubbed her cheek against the stuffed animal.
        <p></p>Amane was feeling a bit jealous of the stuffed cat as she squeezed it tightly with a
        <p></p>cherubic smile. He was having a hard time keeping his emotions in check as he watched
        <p></p>her celebrate.
        <p></p>Mahiru embraced the stuffed animal with an expression of incredible delight, but then
        <p></p>suddenly she looked in Amane's direction and timidly held the toy out to him.
        <p></p>"…Um, will you… accept this?"
        <p></p>"Huh, me?"
        <p></p>"Well, you've given me so many, and you seemed to really like Silky, so…"
        <p></p>Amane liked cats, and that cat in particular had been cute in the way she resembled
        <p></p>Mahiru. But he couldn't come out and say that, so he just scratched his cheek and
        <p></p>nodded.
        <p></p>"…Or you're a guy, so you don't need stuffed animals; is that it…?"
        <p></p>"No, that's not why. I was just wondering if it's really all right for me to take it, since
        <p></p>you worked so hard to win it."
        <p></p>"I was trying to win it for you. I mean, I don't want to sound pushy, umm… But you said
        <p></p>it looked like Silky, so I thought maybe you liked it, so… If you don't want it, I'll decorate
        <p></p>my apartment with it, but…" She looked up at him uneasily, shoulders drooping a little
        <p></p>as if disheartened. There was no way he could turn it down now.
        <p></p>"All right, I'll take it and keep it in my room. Though I, uh… I won't put it by my pillow
        <p></p>like you did with yours."
        <p></p>"I—I wish you'd forget about that…"
        <p></p>"I'll treasure the cat."
        <p></p>Amane politely accepted the stuffed animal from Mahiru, grabbed a carrying bag for
        <p></p>prizes from the dispenser nearby, and placed the cat inside.
        <p></p>Mahiru watched him with a happy smile, and Amane was just about to extend his hand
        <p></p>to her again, when—
        <p></p>"Huh? Shiina?"
        <p></p>A voice called out to her from somewhere nearby, and Amane froze.
        <p></p>Mahiru stiffened, too, and they both turned awkwardly to face the direction the voice
        <p></p>had come from. Standing there was a young man whose handsome face was both
        <p></p>innocent and dignified… Yuuta Kadowaki.
        <p></p>"Kadowaki?"
        <p></p>At the sight of Yuuta, Mahiru immediately put on her angelic smiling face that she
        <p></p>displayed at school. But it seemed a little stiffer than usual, probably because she was
        <p></p>still struggling to regain her composure.
        <p></p>It was Golden Week, so they were well aware there was a good possibility of running
        <p></p>into their classmates, but they had never expected to meet someone they had recently
        <p></p>started hanging out with.
        <p></p>"It's surprising to see you in a game center… Uh, did I interrupt something, perhaps?"
        <p></p>Yuuta noticed Amane and looked worried. He didn't seem to have recognized yet that
        <p></p>it was Amane, but as soon as Amane spoke, he was sure to be found out. On the other
        <p></p>hand, Yuuta's attention was focused on Mahiru, so there was a chance that Amane
        <p></p>could escape notice.
        <p></p>"No, not at all…," Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"This is the first I've heard about you having a boyfriend, you know."
        <p></p>"He's not my boyfriend; we don't have that kind of relationship."
        <p></p>Amane felt a twinge of heartache at Mahiru's flat denial, but it was true that they
        <p></p>weren't dating, so he really didn't have any right to complain. It would have been
        <p></p>stranger if she'd said otherwise.
        <p></p>"W-well, to all appearances… Hmm?"
        <p></p>Yuuta, obviously bewildered by Mahiru's stubborn demeanor, was about to question
        <p></p>her again, when he suddenly focused his attention on Amane.
        <p></p>Their eyes met, and Amane's cheek twitched.
        <p></p>Yuuta stared hard, as if puzzling over what he saw. This was an extremely bad situation
        <p></p>for Amane.
        <p></p>"…Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>Just as Amane expected, Yuuta recognized him.
        <p></p>They hadn't been hanging out for that long yet, but even so, it was clear that Yuuta was
        <p></p>perceptive. No matter how differently Amane dressed or styled his hair, he couldn't
        <p></p>deceive his new friend.
        <p></p>Amane had hoped that maybe Yuuta wouldn't look at a stranger so closely, and he did
        <p></p>look pretty different today, but Yuuta didn't miss the connection.
        <p></p>"Huh, Fujimiya… It's you, right? I can tell now that I see you up close… Could it be, you
        <p></p>two knew each other long ago and met again at school?"
        <p></p>"No, well…"
        <p></p>Yuuta seemed to take it as confirmation when he saw Mahiru hesitating to answer. He
        <p></p>looked back and forth between Mahiru and Amane, appearing downright astonished.
        <p></p>Before he'd started hanging out with Yuuta, Amane might have denied everything, but
        <p></p>now that wasn't even remotely possible. He sighed heavily and pressed on his forehead,
        <p></p>then looked up at Yuuta, who was wearing an inquisitive expression.
        <p></p>"…I'm impressed that you recognized me."
        <p></p>"I knew it! Well, somehow I just knew it was you, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>"Is it that easy to tell?"
        <p></p>"Nah, I don't think anyone in our class would figure you out that quickly. You don't
        <p></p>make that sort of face very often."
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure what "that sort of face" meant, but for the time being, Yuuta didn't
        <p></p>seem to have made the connection between Amane and the "mystery man" Mahiru
        <p></p>had been spotted with, so he was relieved.
        <p></p>"Anyway, it's really something else to run into the both of you, together like this."
        <p></p>"…There's no point in hiding it, so I'll just tell you. It's like you said, we have indeed
        <p></p>known each other since before we started second year. I'll even admit to being good
        <p></p>friends. But we really don't have the kind of relationship that you're imagining,
        <p></p>Kadowaki."
        <p></p>"…Oh really?"
        <p></p>"Really."
        <p></p>Mahiru had not hesitated to deny that there was something going on, so even though
        <p></p>it made him sad to say it, Amane was also clear in his denial. It would cause trouble
        <p></p>for Mahiru if the misunderstanding went any further or became more complicated.
        <p></p>The one who found them just happened to be Yuuta, so he wasn't all that worried, but
        <p></p>there would be trouble if others became suspicious—and their secret got out. He
        <p></p>absolutely had to forbid Yuuta to speak of it.
        <p></p>Amane adopted a firm stance, and Mahiru grasped his sleeve and looked up at him.
        <p></p>She seemed to have something to say but didn't make any move to open her mouth, so
        <p></p>for the time being, he didn't press her.
        <p></p>Yuuta watched Amane's and Mahiru's behavior, and whether he understood or didn't,
        <p></p>he shrugged slightly.
        <p></p>"Hmm… Well, that's all fine and good. I have to say, it's just like Itsuki said."
        <p></p>"What did he say?"
        <p></p>Amane's eyes narrowed involuntarily when he thought about Itsuki having some slip
        <p></p>of the tongue.
        <p></p>"Nothing you need to worry about." Yuuta laughed. "But he said you look cool when
        <p></p>you get dressed up properly. I was just thinking you do look really sharp."
        <p></p>"That sounds sarcastic coming from you, Kadowaki."
        <p></p>Amane could do nothing but smile bitterly at the compliment from the top heartthrob
        <p></p>in their year, maybe in the whole school.
        <p></p>Yuuta was the type of guy who didn't have to try to be attractive. Guys like Amane, who
        <p></p>had to spend time getting dressed up just to look decent, were always destined to be
        <p></p>jealous of guys like him. Amane didn't go so far as to begrudge the other boy his good
        <p></p>looks, but he did on occasion imagine having a more lustrous life if he'd only had the
        <p></p>good fortune to be born like that.
        <p></p>"I wasn't trying to be sarcastic. Just saying, you should style yourself like this all the
        <p></p>time."
        <p></p>"No way; it would be a pain to set my hair every morning. And it would stand out if I
        <p></p>suddenly showed up at school looking like this."
        <p></p>"Well, that is true, but… Shiina, you must have known that Fujimiya could look like
        <p></p>this?"
        <p></p>"That's, well… Yes."
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded uncomfortably as Yuuta turned to study her.
        <p></p>It wasn't a look of scrutiny or distrust. More like he was searching for clues.
        <p></p>"Mm-hmm, I think I understand."
        <p></p>"Understand what?"
        <p></p>"That you also don't want to cause Shiina any trouble."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked startled by his words. Yuuta laughed quietly and said, "You're easier to
        <p></p>read that I expected, Shiina."
        <p></p>He gave a thin smile. It looked somewhat warm, yet lonely in a way—and perhaps even
        <p></p>tinged with a bit of jealousy.
        <p></p>"Um, Kadowaki?" Mahiru asked hesitantly.
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"Well… I'd like to ask you not to say anything about this to other people. About us being
        <p></p>f-friends, and… everything." Mahiru would be troubled if he said anything, so she also
        <p></p>asked for his silence.
        <p></p>Yuuta nodded readily. "Ah, you don't have to worry about that. I think I understand
        <p></p>why you want to keep this hidden, and I appreciate how you feel. Besides, I've found
        <p></p>that once rumors about you are spread around, you don't much enjoy spreading them
        <p></p>yourself."
        <p></p>Amane had never been so grateful that Yuuta was such a person of character. Also, he
        <p></p>imagined that their situation was probably something Yuuta could deeply relate to. He
        <p></p>was extremely popular with the girls at school, and so he often had to deal with
        <p></p>jealousy from members of his own sex, and on the flip side, if he ever made friends
        <p></p>with a member of the opposite sex, that girl would be in danger. He had told Amane as
        <p></p>much, so he was probably speaking from experience.
        <p></p>Even if they didn't have a romantic relationship, if it became known that a plain guy
        <p></p>like Amane had become friends with the graceful angel Mahiru, who turned away
        <p></p>every suitor, there was bound to be trouble.
        <p></p>Amane was very grateful that Yuuta apparently understood that and would keep his
        <p></p>peace.
        <p></p>"Thanks, Kadowaki."
        <p></p>"Yeah, well, I think it's the normal thing to do. And besides, I wouldn't want to do
        <p></p>anything to jeopardize our relationship, Fujimiya. Not after I finally managed to make
        <p></p>a friend."
        <p></p>Yuuta flashed one of his bright smiles at them, and looking at him, Amane keenly
        <p></p>understood why this boy was so popular. Even speaking as another boy, Amane thought
        <p></p>that Yuuta was a friendly, earnest guy, so he could understand how the girls might find
        <p></p>him utterly charming. It wasn't just because he was handsome; he was also a good
        <p></p>person. The other guys in their class didn't stand a chance.
        <p></p>"Oh, that's right. Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"I'll see you the day after tomorrow."
        <p></p>That day, which Yuuta casually mentioned in a slightly coy tone, was the day when
        <p></p>Amane, Itsuki, and Yuuta had planned to go to karaoke together. In other words, Yuuta
        <p></p>was telling him he would be asking for more details about this situation then.
        <p></p>When their eyes met, Yuuta was wearing a playful smile, underpinned by his peculiar
        <p></p>brand of confidence.
        <p></p>"Got it," Amane answered, though he really felt like running away.
        <p></p>Mahiru watched Amane and Yuuta with a hint of jealousy.
        <p></p>"Sorry about that."
        <p></p>They had separated from Kadowaki and were on their way home, and on the walk to
        <p></p>the apartments from the nearest train station, Amane apologized to Mahiru in a quiet
        <p></p>voice.
        <p></p>Mahiru, who was quite satisfied that she had won some other small toys at the game
        <p></p>center, blinked her caramel-colored eyes in surprise at this sudden apology.
        <p></p>"What are you apologizing for, all of a sudden?"
        <p></p>"Well… for getting found out by Kadowaki."
        <p></p>"Surely that was an accident. Besides, I think everything turned out all right. He
        <p></p>seemed to be rather understanding…"
        <p></p>Now that she said that, he knew it was true, but even so, he was annoyed that someone
        <p></p>suspected that they were dating.
        <p></p>Fortunately, Yuuta had not hung around long, probably because he could tell how
        <p></p>uncomfortable Amane was in that situation. Still, it had tugged at Amane's heart to
        <p></p>hear Mahiru deny everything so definitively.
        <p></p>"Besides, it's not like we weren't aware that something like this could happen when
        <p></p>we decided to go out," Mahiru continued. "Considering the possibilities, I think we're
        <p></p>lucky it was Kadowaki who saw us."
        <p></p>"You're right. For better or worse, Kadowaki knows, but at least he's being cool about
        <p></p>it. He really is a stand-up guy."
        <p></p>It's a good thing he's the one we ran into.
        <p></p>Amane had resigned himself to being cross-examined later, but when he considered
        <p></p>that he would no longer have to feel guilty about continuing to conceal things from
        <p></p>Yuuta at school, it was actually probably a good thing that they were discovered.
        <p></p>Amane had a feeling that Yuuta had also discerned how he felt about Mahiru, but as
        <p></p>long as he didn't tell Mahiru herself, there would be no problem on that front.
        <p></p>He would probably get teased a little bit at karaoke, but Yuuta and Itsuki both had
        <p></p>some discretion in that area, so he shouldn't get it too bad.
        <p></p>"…Amane, you have quite a high opinion of Kadowaki, don't you?"
        <p></p>"Hmm? Uh, I guess so. We've had more and more chances to talk, and I've come to
        <p></p>realize he's popular because he's a really good guy. He's really attractive inside and
        <p></p>out."
        <p></p>"And you trust him, don't you?"
        <p></p>"Trust him…? Well… Yeah, I think he's a stand-up guy."
        <p></p>Amane already knew he could be pretty picky about the people he hung out with. If he
        <p></p>didn't like someone's personality, he would naturally keep them at arm's length. But
        <p></p>Amane's gut told him that Yuuta was a good guy, and that was exactly why he wasn't
        <p></p>too panicked at being found out.
        <p></p>"All right, well, they do say birds of a feather flock together," Mahiru mused.
        <p></p>"I don't know if I belong to that flock…"
        <p></p>"You're putting yourself down again, Amane. Kadowaki decided to be friends with you
        <p></p>because he liked your personality, right? Isn't that the same thing you thought about
        <p></p>him? And Kadowaki, who you think is trustworthy, recognizes something good in you,
        <p></p>so you ought to have more confidence."
        <p></p>Mahiru gently poked his cheek with the tip of her finger, and Amane smiled softly at
        <p></p>her.
        <p></p>Of course he couldn't grant her wish, but as someone who always thought the worst
        <p></p>of himself, he was grateful for her reassurance.
        <p></p>Amane chuckled quietly at Mahiru's sudden lecture on self-confidence, but he also felt
        <p></p>very grateful toward her.
        <p></p>"You're always saying nice things about me, huh, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Well, I'm only telling the truth. It's not good for you to always be so hard on yourself."
        <p></p>"It's a habit."
        <p></p>"Well, why did you develop that bad habit? It's a real pain, you know." Mahiru grumbled
        <p></p>in open frustration.
        <p></p>He wasn't sure how to answer the question. Though he knew perfectly well the reason
        <p></p>why.
        <p></p>The simple answer was that he was afraid of failure.
        <p></p>Humans are quick learners. That goes for things both good and bad. Amane didn't
        <p></p>want to fail, and he didn't want to get his hopes up, only for others to turn on him. So
        <p></p>in order to protect himself from disappointment, he kept his expectations low.
        <p></p>But he didn't know how he should tell Mahiru that. And honestly, he didn't particularly
        <p></p>want to have to explain it.
        <p></p>Mahiru stared at him with clear eyes, like she could read his mind. Then just as he
        <p></p>started feeling uncomfortable, she looked away, leaned toward him, and pressed
        <p></p>herself against his upper arm again.
        <p></p>"If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to, but please just remember that I accept
        <p></p>you, okay? It's not good to be so hard on yourself."
        <p></p>"…Sure."
        <p></p>"If I need to, I'm going to praise you until you beg me to stop."
        <p></p>"Whoa, scary. You say it like that, but I really do want you to stop. I can't take it
        <p></p>anymore."
        <p></p>"Well then, you need to have more self-confidence."
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled faintly and squeezed his hand. Feeling heat gradually surging up
        <p></p>through his chest but not wanting to destroy this pleasant moment, Amane didn't let
        <p></p>go. He just replied with a quiet "Thanks" and kept walking down the road home.
        <p></p>He didn't want to let go of her hand, but he knew that they would have to let go once
        <p></p>they reached home, so he deliberately walked a little slowly, and Mahiru matched his
        <p></p>pace without saying another word.

        <p></p>Chapter 36: An Interrogation 
        <p></p>"Now then, I would like to ask you a bit about what happened the day before
        <p></p>yesterday."
        <p></p>It was two days after Amane's outing with Mahiru. The day he had plans to go sing
        <p></p>karaoke with Itsuki and Yuuta.
        <p></p>As soon as they had assembled and entered their reserved room, Yuuta immediately
        <p></p>turned to him with a smile.
        <p></p>Amane had prepared himself for an interrogation, but even so, he felt really awkward
        <p></p>being asked about this again.
        <p></p>Itsuki seemed to have heard about the incident from Yuuta and was wearing an
        <p></p>expression that said Uh-oh, you got caught! He wasn't even trying to hide his
        <p></p>amusement.
        <p></p>After bringing the cup of melon soda he had gotten from the self-service drink bar to
        <p></p>his lips and wetting his throat, Amane reluctantly began to explain.
        <p></p>"…It's nothing that serious. Itsuki and Chitose knew about it already. Mahiru and I live
        <p></p>next door to each other. That was honestly a total coincidence. And well, a bunch of
        <p></p>things happened, and we got closer, I guess."
        <p></p>Thanks to Chitose, there was no use in trying to conceal the fact that they were already
        <p></p>on a first-name basis, so as he explained the situation, he used Mahiru's name like he
        <p></p>always did at home.
        <p></p>"You got to know each other, and then you went out together?"
        <p></p>"Yeah."
        <p></p>They were obviously more than simple acquaintances. In the best-case scenario, they
        <p></p>looked like friends, in the worst, lovers. But as far as Amane was concerned, for the
        <p></p>sake of Mahiru's honor, he had to flatly deny everything.
        <p></p>"It's definitely not the kind of relationship you're imagining, Kadowaki," he reasserted.
        <p></p>"And I have a feeling it's not quite what you're describing, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>"Come on—"
        <p></p>"Their situation goes way beyond friends, I'd say," Itsuki interjected. "Considering
        <p></p>Shiina comes over to make dinner for him every day."
        <p></p>Amane's cheek twitched as he glared at his friend. "Itsuki!"
        <p></p>"The truth was gonna come out sooner or later, so it's better to just hurry up and spill
        <p></p>it all now."
        <p></p>When he put it that way, Itsuki was probably right, but by suddenly providing the
        <p></p>detail that Amane was eating Mahiru's home cooking every day, he all but guaranteed
        <p></p>a misunderstanding.
        <p></p>"…So she's like your girlfriend?"
        <p></p>"Not even a little," Amane insisted. "We both live alone, so it's more convenient to split
        <p></p>the food costs and make enough for two; that's all."
        <p></p>"Yeah, that's definitely all it is…," Itsuki said without a trace of sincerity.
        <p></p>Yuuta looked unimpressed. "That's not very convincing, Fujimiya…"
        <p></p>"Not you too, Kadowaki…"
        <p></p>He and Mahiru definitely were not in love with each other, but he was having a hard
        <p></p>time explaining that, and the way Yuuta was staring at him was making him nervous.
        <p></p>Not that he'd been all that composed to begin with.
        <p></p>"Normally, a girl won't hang around a guy she doesn't approve of, and she definitely
        <p></p>wouldn't follow him into his apartment. Unless she's the one chasing after him
        <p></p>anyway."
        <p></p>Yuuta's addendum at the end sounded like it came from a place of experience, which
        <p></p>reminded Amane how wary Yuuta was of girls and their intentions. But he was right,
        <p></p>more or less, Amane realized.
        <p></p>Girls, and Mahiru in particular, were usually very careful and typically didn't approach
        <p></p>guys without reason. Amane recognized that the fact that Mahiru associated with him
        <p></p>at all was close to miraculous. But he knew this was a special case.
        <p></p>Amane just couldn't imagine she would ever like him as a guy, or anything like that.
        <p></p>Sometimes he even thought that the reason Mahiru was so comfortable around him
        <p></p>was because she didn't even consider him a man.
        <p></p>"…Fujimiya, you're so hard on yourself," Yuuta said. "And you can be really stubborn."
        <p></p>"What he said," Itsuki agreed.
        <p></p>Itsuki and Yuuta were both looking at Amane with exasperated looks, so it was really
        <p></p>uncomfortable.
        <p></p>"So when it comes down to it, do you like Shiina?"
        <p></p>Yuuta chose to thrust this outrageous question at him at the exact moment Amane
        <p></p>took a drink of his melon soda to mask his discomfort, and he very nearly spit it back
        <p></p>out. "…Why would you ask that, all of sudden?" he sputtered.
        <p></p>"Well, you're being pretty cagey, but I saw how you acted when you were out with
        <p></p>Mahiru, so I'm sure you must care about her, even if only a little. Plus, I could tell by
        <p></p>the way you looked at her—and by your whole demeanor, really—that you like her."
        <p></p>Amane nodded meekly. "…Is there something wrong with that?"
        <p></p>Man, Yuuta sure as hell pays close attention…
        <p></p>For some reason, Yuuta smiled wryly at him. "No, it's not bad or anything, but… mmm,
        <p></p>it probably won't be easy, I'd imagine."
        <p></p>"I have no delusions about dating Mahiru."
        <p></p>"Yes, yes, I can see there are still some things you don't understand. Itsuki's here to
        <p></p>give you some encouragement, too."
        <p></p>"You could say that," Itsuki muttered. "What I really want is to give him a strong kick
        <p></p>in the ass."
        <p></p>Yuuta nodded. "I know just how you feel."
        <p></p>"Don't tell me that's where you two agree…," Amane groaned.
        <p></p>So now Yuuta's ready to kick me in the butt, too?
        <p></p>"Look, man, the thing is: It's really frustrating to watch," Itsuki said. "We want you to
        <p></p>push the issue a little."
        <p></p>"Give it a rest already!"
        <p></p>"Hold on; just listen for a sec, all right?" Itsuki continued. "Shiina lets her guard down
        <p></p>around you. If you put a little pressure on, she'll give in for sure."
        <p></p>"Okay, listen, I admit, Mahiru probably likes me, but… she doesn't like me that way;
        <p></p>you know what I mean?"
        <p></p>Itsuki made it all sound so easy, but Amane knew better.
        <p></p>To begin with, he was incredibly self-conscious about the very fact of his deep affection
        <p></p>for Mahiru. He did have to admit that she seemed to care about him more than any
        <p></p>other guy, but he didn't think her feelings were romantic. Instead, he figured it was
        <p></p>something akin to the way you might feel about a close and trusted confidant.
        <p></p>"How can you say that, when you've seen the way she looks at you?"
        <p></p>"What would she find attractive about me?"
        <p></p>When Amane offered that rebuttal, Itsuki smacked him on the back as hard as he
        <p></p>could.
        <p></p>"…Oww!"
        <p></p>"I feel bad for hitting you, but come on, are you kidding me? You seriously have way
        <p></p>too little confidence! You lose your nerve or run away at the most crucial moment."
        <p></p>"…Yeah well, so what? That's just how I am. I can't help it."
        <p></p>"We've got to break the habit, then. You're way too down on yourself."
        <p></p>"Mahiru tells me that a lot."
        <p></p>"…So it's bothering Shiina as well?" Yuuta asked.
        <p></p>"It's bothering all of us who have to watch him!" Itsuki clamored. "This guy is so
        <p></p>stubborn about things like that."
        <p></p>"Shut up, will you!"
        <p></p>Amane really hated it when people ganged up on him.
        <p></p>This was just the way he was, and even if he did try to change, it certainly wouldn't be
        <p></p>that easy. Traumatic memories didn't just go away because he wanted them to. Not
        <p></p>enough time had passed yet for him to try to forget and move on.
        <p></p>Amane was well aware of how pathetic and worthless he was, but there was nothing
        <p></p>he could do.
        <p></p>"I mean, I can't force your hand if you tell me you've had enough," Itsuki said. "But if
        <p></p>you like Shiina, and you want to go out with her, you need to try harder."
        <p></p>"…And you think I can do that?"
        <p></p>"If you weren't such a wuss…"
        <p></p>"Oh, shut up."
        <p></p>"Come on, that's enough," Yuuta chided. "But I do have to say I agree with Itsuki. You
        <p></p>should have a little more faith in yourself, Fujimiya. Really, you'd get a lot of attention
        <p></p>at school if you dressed up like you did the other day. Maybe you should give it some
        <p></p>practice."
        <p></p>"Practice?"
        <p></p>"Well, you didn't have any trouble getting dressed up for Shiina, and you didn't freak
        <p></p>out when I saw you like that, either. So maybe practice your new look on people you
        <p></p>know, so you can get used to it. A good way to enjoy this precious break, don't you
        <p></p>think?"
        <p></p>"…Meaning what?"
        <p></p>"Let's see; I've got some hair wax in here somewhere…"
        <p></p>Swiftly, Yuuta pulled some men's grooming wax out of his bag. When their eyes met,
        <p></p>Yuuta was grinning boldly. Typical of the class prince, it was a lovely smile, but it sent
        <p></p>a chill down Amane's spine. "So how about it?" he asked.
        <p></p>"…I'll pass."
        <p></p>"Come on now, don't be shy."
        <p></p>"Hey, uh, aren't we at a karaoke parlor? Shouldn't we be doing karaoke or something?"
        <p></p>"Oh, you're right!" Yuuta replied. "Okay, I'm gonna sing, so I'll entrust Amane to your
        <p></p>capable care, Itsuki my friend."
        <p></p>"Just leave it to me."
        <p></p>"You've gotta be joking…," Amane muttered. All he got in return was an enthusiastic
        <p></p>grin.
        <p></p>"I mean, usually this isn't the kind of thing I'd do by force, but… in your case, Amane,
        <p></p>it's time you got used to being the center of a little bit of attention, so I've got to take
        <p></p>drastic measures!"
        <p></p>"Hey, you can't… Waah!"
        <p></p>Itsuki grinned and brandished the comb and hair wax, and though Amane tried to back
        <p></p>away, there wasn't enough space for a proper retreat in the small karaoke room.
        <p></p>Amane was forced to endure Yuuta's joyful singing while Itsuki meddled with his hair.
        <p></p>"…Welcome ho… me…?"
        <p></p>When Amane made it back to his apartment, Mahiru came out to greet him with a
        <p></p>question in her voice.
        <p></p>She was making stewed hamburger steaks for dinner and had let herself into Amane's
        <p></p>apartment early to make the sauce.
        <p></p>She had sent him a message saying that dinner was nearly done, so he knew that she
        <p></p>would be at his place, but when he saw Mahiru's face again, he felt a rush of relief.
        <p></p>"I'm back…"
        <p></p>"Why do you look so worn out…?"
        <p></p>"…Itsuki had his way with me."
        <p></p>Itsuki had never seen Amane's "mystery man" look, so he had styled Amane's hair in
        <p></p>a way he thought looked cool, which of course didn't really fit what Amane was used
        <p></p>to.
        <p></p>To make matters worse, after they were done with karaoke, the other boys had dragged
        <p></p>him to a store that carried the type of clothes that Amane wasn't likely to have and
        <p></p>then embarked on a hunt for something that would suit him.
        <p></p>He hadn't particularly hated the experience or anything, but he was completely
        <p></p>exhausted, having been treated like a dress-up doll by his two friends.
        <p></p>"Uh-huh, you had a tough time, didn't you?"
        <p></p>"…They played with me like a toy…"
        <p></p>"You must be tired."
        <p></p>Maybe because she could tell he wasn't actually upset, Mahiru let a quiet chuckle slip
        <p></p>out as she commended him for his patience.
        <p></p>Feeling slightly embarrassed at being so transparent, Amane tossed the bag containing
        <p></p>the new clothes he had purchased into his room and went to the sink to wash his
        <p></p>hands.
        <p></p>Mahiru returned to the kitchen to serve dinner, so when Amane entered the living
        <p></p>room after properly washing his hands and rinsing his mouth, she had already set the
        <p></p>dishes of stewed hamburger steaks down on the dining table.
        <p></p>Amane felt bad for not helping, so as he always did, he headed for the kitchen to dish
        <p></p>up the cooked rice.
        <p></p>Amane had always thought rice paired nicely with hamburger steak, and the
        <p></p>indescribable sweet aroma of freshly cooked rice made him smile.
        <p></p>"Man, I'm really tired… But actually, it made me appreciate Itsuki and Yuuta again.
        <p></p>They're amazing."
        <p></p>"What do you mean?"
        <p></p>Once they had set out the salad and potage soup and taken their seats across the table,
        <p></p>Mahiru tilted her head at Amane's curious grumblings.
        <p></p>"Well, we got hassled constantly while we were walking around. It made me realize
        <p></p>that guys who have always been popular are a different breed of human. They're used
        <p></p>to that treatment, and the way they go through life is just different."
        <p></p>When the boys had gone on their shopping tour after karaoke, for some reason, various
        <p></p>girls who seemed to be about college age had come up to talk to them several times.
        <p></p>Well, Itsuki and Yuuta were both handsome guys, although in different ways, so it
        <p></p>seemed only natural for them to catch girls' eyes. They had experienced the so-called
        <p></p>reverse pickup.
        <p></p>They had declined every proposal, though. Itsuki had his true love, Chitose, and the
        <p></p>class prince apparently hated pushy girls. He wore a sweet smile but was always on
        <p></p>guard, and before long, their would-be dates got the message that he was turning them
        <p></p>down. Even when he was rejecting them, Yuuta was affable and considerate, so he
        <p></p>wouldn't hurt their feelings. And it seemed to work well for him. Amane had struggled
        <p></p>to deal with a similar situation earlier, and he was impressed by his friend's wellpracticed tact.
        <p></p>"…Did the girls talk to you, too, Amane?"
        <p></p>"They did, but only because I happened to be with the guys."
        <p></p>If he had to guess, the girls were really only interested in his two friends and saw
        <p></p>Amane merely as a nice bonus. After all, as he well knew, he was very bad at talking to
        <p></p>strangers. Once in a while, somebody would talk to him when he went out somewhere,
        <p></p>but this time there had been two exceptionally handsome guys next to him, so no one
        <p></p>was going to give him a second look.
        <p></p>Amane shrugged and grinned wryly, but for some reason, Mahiru was sticking her lip
        <p></p>out in a little pout.
        <p></p>"What is it?" he asked. "You want to tell me I'm being too hard on myself?"
        <p></p>"Well, there's also that… But that's not it."
        <p></p>"What is it, then?"
        <p></p>"…If you don't know, then don't worry about it," Mahiru said unhelpfully, before
        <p></p>pressing her hands together in thanks. "Let's eat."
        <p></p>Amane was perplexed, but he mimicked her and pressed his hands together, giving
        <p></p>thanks for the food and for Mahiru.
        <p></p>It was the day after the three boys had gone to karaoke.
        <p></p>As usual, Mahiru had come over to Amane's apartment.
        <p></p>Recently, she had been spending a lot of time there when she wasn't at school. In fact,
        <p></p>since the start of Golden Week, she had been at his place almost every day. Even if she
        <p></p>wasn't there during the day, she would always come over to make dinner in the
        <p></p>evening. Amane was of course quite happy to have the object of his affections close by,
        <p></p>so he let Mahiru do whatever she liked.
        <p></p>Today, she was next to him playing on her phone. Fiddling with her phone was a
        <p></p>completely normal thing to do, of course, but she was staring at the screen with a bit
        <p></p>more enthusiasm than usual.
        <p></p>And while it would have been an invasion of her privacy to peek at the screen, and
        <p></p>Amane had no intention of doing so, he couldn't help but say something, since it was
        <p></p>so unusual for Mahiru to be absorbed in her phone like that, when she usually only
        <p></p>used it to contact someone or look something up.
        <p></p>"What have you been looking at all this time?" Amane ventured, figuring that just
        <p></p>asking wouldn't be rude.
        <p></p>For some reason, Mahiru jumped at his question. Then she turned to look in Amane's
        <p></p>direction with a nervous frown. Amane was puzzled. He wasn't sure what might make
        <p></p>her act that way.
        <p></p>Then Mahiru turned away from him. She only did that when she was feeling guilty
        <p></p>about something.
        <p></p>"…You're hiding something," Amane insisted.
        <p></p>"H-hiding…? Well, promise you won't get mad?"
        <p></p>"Are you doing something that would make me mad?"
        <p></p>Amane had been told that his resting facial expression looked a bit sullen, but he very
        <p></p>rarely got angry, and he had never before gotten truly upset with Mahiru. He didn't
        <p></p>think she'd give him a reason to lose his temper—at worst, he could imagine getting a
        <p></p>little annoyed.
        <p></p>"…Depending on how you're feeling, you might get upset."
        <p></p>"Hmm. Well, why don't you tell me, and we'll see?"
        <p></p>"…Well, your mother has been… sending me old photos of you."
        <p></p>"Oh, I'm sure she had plenty to share…"
        <p></p>He had a lot of questions for his mother about why she thought it was okay to send
        <p></p>Mahiru photos of him out of the blue like that.
        <p></p>"W-well, there's a reason, you see. Your mother and I were talking, and we just
        <p></p>happened to get on the subject of Children's Day, and… and I said 'I bet Amane was
        <p></p>really cute when he was little… ' So you see…"
        <p></p>"Wait, let me take a look at them. She didn't send you anything really outrageous,
        <p></p>right?"
        <p></p>When it came to old photos, there were sure to be some Amane had forgotten about.
        <p></p>But he could definitely remember a few that captured embarrassing moments he
        <p></p>would rather nobody see. His mother really ought to have let him inspect the pictures
        <p></p>before sending any to Mahiru.
        <p></p>Mahiru refused to answer his question. She wouldn't even look him in the eye. From
        <p></p>her reaction, Amane could guess that the photos were something he wouldn't like. He
        <p></p>glowered at her but wasn't about to try to rip the smartphone out of her hands, so he
        <p></p>decided to press her until she capitulated and confessed.
        <p></p>"Mahiru… would you rather cooperate and show me the photos, or am I gonna have
        <p></p>to bug you till you do?"
        <p></p>With a serious look on his face, Amane sat up on one knee and put a hand on the back
        <p></p>of the sofa behind Mahiru's head. He leaned in close to her, leaving her with little room
        <p></p>to escape.
        <p></p>Mahiru's face would go pale when she saw he had cornered her… or so he thought, but
        <p></p>instead she flushed red and squeezed her favorite cushion to her chest. She looked
        <p></p>even more nervous than before but still wasn't talking.
        <p></p>Is it that bad…?
        <p></p>Amane had a sinking feeling. He continued staring intently into Mahiru's eyes, but he
        <p></p>didn't get the reaction he was hoping for. Far from it, she tried to push the cushion into
        <p></p>his face.
        <p></p>Amane grabbed the cushion and tossed it aside. He didn't understand why she was
        <p></p>making such a big fuss. Mahiru must not have been holding the cushion too tightly,
        <p></p>because he was easily able to pull it out of her hand and send it rolling across the floor.
        <p></p>Mahiru still hadn't budged from her spot on the sofa.
        <p></p>"Come on; it's time to fess up," Amane whispered as he closed in to pinch her cheek.
        <p></p>Without warning, Mahiru flopped down on the sofa. It happened so quickly that
        <p></p>Amane couldn't react, and on her way down, Mahiru collided with the arm he'd been
        <p></p>using to support himself, so he also lost his balance and tumbled down onto the sofa.
        <p></p>Fortunately, he managed to catch himself before he crushed Mahiru, but he ended up
        <p></p>much closer to her than he expected.
        <p></p>Both of them froze at this sudden proximity.
        <p></p>Their bodies weren't too close, but their faces were so close that their breath
        <p></p>intertwined, and if he leaned in just a little, their noses would bump. Amane was close
        <p></p>enough to see that the long eyelashes that rimmed Mahiru's wide, caramel-colored
        <p></p>eyes were quivering slightly. At this distance, Mahiru's characteristic sweet scent filled
        <p></p>his nostrils, and he didn't know what he should do.
        <p></p>Both of them were frozen stiff, but Mahiru was the first to move.
        <p></p>Her light-pink lips trembled, and she squeezed her eyes shut tightly. Her face was
        <p></p>flushed, and she was taking shallow, timid breaths. She appeared nervous, as if she
        <p></p>was preparing for some kind of impact, but her lips looked soft and sweet. She seemed
        <p></p>simultaneously innocent and alluring. Mahiru practically embodied such contradictions.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't look away.
        <p></p>The sight of her aroused both his desire to protect her and the urge to make her his,
        <p></p>and in spite of his better judgment, Amane reached out his hand—
        <p></p>—and pinched Mahiru on the cheek.
        <p></p>"Wha—?"
        <p></p>"…That's a funny face," he muttered with a wry chuckle.
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes flew open, and her expression changed in an instant. Instead of the
        <p></p>bashfulness from before, now it was more like equal parts shame and anger. She glared
        <p></p>at him through tear-filled eyes. "Is that what you're going to say after pinning a girl
        <p></p>down and touching her face?"
        <p></p>Amane smiled again. "Okay, okay, that was my bad. I wasn't expecting a struggle."
        <p></p>"Oh, well excuse me for putting up a fight!" she replied. "It only happened because you
        <p></p>pushed me down!"
        <p></p>"That was because you were hiding the photos my mom sent you behind my back."
        <p></p>"Ack!… Ughhh."
        <p></p>When it became clear that Mahiru wasn't going to say anything else, Amane moved off
        <p></p>of her, still smiling. He slipped a hand between the sofa and Mahiru's back and helped
        <p></p>her sit up. Mahiru moved her lips like she was mumbling something to herself and
        <p></p>made an odd expression.
        <p></p>"So…," Amane said. "Are you going to let me examine my own photographs?"
        <p></p>"…Knock yourself out," she said with resignation. She still sounded annoyed, and her
        <p></p>face was as red as ever, but she showed Amane the image list from the chat between
        <p></p>his mother and her.
        <p></p>If he was to point out how badly she was blushing, she would probably rush right out
        <p></p>of his apartment, so Amane resisted the urge to say anything else as he looked away
        <p></p>so Mahiru couldn't see his face.
        <p></p>…That was a surprise.
        <p></p>Amane was trying to stay calm, but even now his heart was pounding out a rhythm
        <p></p>with explosive force.
        <p></p>He wasn't sure what he might have done to Mahiru if he hadn't stopped himself and
        <p></p>pinched her instead. She had certainly shown no signs of stopping him.
        <p></p>Man, I was almost a real jerk just then…
        <p></p>Shame weighed heavy in his gut. Yes, it had been an accident, and maybe they were
        <p></p>both at least a little bit to blame. But that certainly didn't make it okay to touch Mahiru
        <p></p>so intimately, in a manner usually reserved for lovers. That would not have been
        <p></p>acceptable.
        <p></p>If he had gone ahead and kissed her, he was sure Mahiru would have burst into tears
        <p></p>or something along those lines. It wouldn't have been right to do something like that.
        <p></p>He wasn't her boyfriend or anything. And if he had done it anyway, she would have
        <p></p>definitely cut him out of her life for good.
        <p></p>Amane didn't want to be the kind of selfish person who only thought about what he
        <p></p>wanted.
        <p></p>"…Amane, you said you wanted to check the photos, but are you even going to look at
        <p></p>them?" Mahiru asked. She sounded even more sullen than before, and when Amane
        <p></p>looked in her direction, he saw that the redness in her face had finally started to abate
        <p></p>somewhat, and she had her cheeks puffed out a bit.
        <p></p>"Sorry, I was busy thinking."
        <p></p>"Dummy."
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't often insult him, and she had used a word that was kind of cute, but
        <p></p>Amane could tell from her tone that she was running out of patience, so he quickly
        <p></p>looked down at the smartphone.
        <p></p>In the photo roll were pictures of Amane from preschool and elementary school. At a
        <p></p>glance, he didn't see anything especially painful, so that was a relief, but there were
        <p></p>images of him beaming with an innocent smile he couldn't even imagine emulating
        <p></p>now, so he still felt awfully embarrassed.
        <p></p>Amane's face was turning red for a different reason at this moment, and to distract
        <p></p>himself from the shame welling up inside, he glanced over at Mahiru. She was no
        <p></p>longer wearing a sullen expression—instead, she was staring dreamily out into space
        <p></p>with her hand over her mouth, looking dazed.
        <p></p>Sensing that he wasn't supposed to see her like that, Amane quickly lowered his eyes
        <p></p>back to the phone.
        <p></p>His heart was pounding again, and he tried to focus his eyes and his mind on anything
        <p></p>else.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 37: None but You 
        <p></p>…Come to think of it, Amane, are you doing anything for Mother's Day?" Mahiru asked
        <p></p>quietly, as if she had just remembered the holiday. They were watching television
        <p></p>together, and she'd noticed a listing for a program labeled as a Mother's Day special.
        <p></p>Amane had tried to casually change the channel, figuring that Mahiru wouldn't like
        <p></p>being reminded of her parents, but she didn't seem particularly bothered.
        <p></p>He nodded, feeling a little relieved that she wasn't upset. "Well, I guess I'll send a small
        <p></p>present and a bouquet to the house."
        <p></p>It was a little bit of a hassle, but she was his one and only mother, after all, and he
        <p></p>figured as her son he ought to show his appreciation for everything she did for him.
        <p></p>But since he was out of the house now, it wasn't like he could go say it in person.
        <p></p>"Well, since I'm far away, that's about all I can do. If we still lived together or close by,
        <p></p>I would try to do a little more, but…"
        <p></p>"Like help with the housework?"
        <p></p>"Honestly, if I try to help, I just end up making more work for her."
        <p></p>Thanks to Mahiru, Amane had learned how to do basic housework, or at least enough
        <p></p>to get along okay on his own. But he didn't think he would be able to do everything to
        <p></p>his parents' standards, so they would just end up redoing everything in the end.
        <p></p>"I guess you would."
        <p></p>"I don't know how I feel about you agreeing with that…"
        <p></p>"…But you have learned enough to keep up with the everyday chores. I mean, it's far
        <p></p>from perfect, but you can get by now."
        <p></p>"That's a harsh appraisal. That said, you're not wrong."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh. You've still got a ways to go, Amane."
        <p></p>"Yes, yes, I'm no match for the marvelous Miss Mahiru."
        <p></p>"I'll say."
        <p></p>Amane had a feeling that even if he spent his whole life working on it, he would never
        <p></p>get as good at housework as Mahiru was now.
        <p></p>Mahiru laughed, a little surprised by Amane's words, and slapped his upper arm, but
        <p></p>there wasn't any malice behind it, so he didn't complain.
        <p></p>"I don't know how your parents could make you live alone when you couldn't even
        <p></p>take care of yourself, Amane."
        <p></p>She probably hadn't meant to say that out loud—but she'd obviously been thinking it.
        <p></p>When they'd first met, Amane had been such a mess that even Itsuki had been worried
        <p></p>about him. So it was no surprise Mahiru would doubt him now. She knew exactly how
        <p></p>bad it could get.
        <p></p>Amane pretended not to notice the shock of pain that went through his chest and
        <p></p>shrugged. "Actually, I don't think they ever wanted to let me out of their sight? I was a
        <p></p>real loser with absolutely no life skills, after all."
        <p></p>"So it was your decision to move out on your own?"
        <p></p>"Yeah. Some stuff happened, and I didn't want to stay in my hometown anymore."
        <p></p>If he made it sound too serious, Mahiru was likely to worry, so he tried to gloss over it,
        <p></p>attempting to keep his cool while he did.
        <p></p>Mahiru froze. Immediately, shades of remorse began flickering through her caramelcolored eyes. Amane hadn't meant to upset her, but Mahiru, who was particularly
        <p></p>sensitive to other people's pain, had gotten a glimpse of the baggage he was carrying.
        <p></p>Sometimes her insight could be troubling.
        <p></p>Amane regretting mentioning it in the first place. He reached out and patted Mahiru
        <p></p>on the head as she grimaced at him.
        <p></p>"Ah, you really don't have to worry about it," he said. "Actually, it puts me in a tough
        <p></p>spot if you're too worried about me. Really, it's not that big of a deal. There were just
        <p></p>some guys in my hometown who I would rather not see again, so I left."
        <p></p>In reality, it hadn't been that serious. Just that something he had earnestly believed in
        <p></p>had crumbled from its very foundation; that's all. He hadn't been physically injured or
        <p></p>anything like that, and now that he had cut off all contact with those guys, he was living
        <p></p>a normal life, and the dull ache of old wounds had faded into the background.
        <p></p>Despite what he said, Mahiru's melancholy expression didn't go away. Amane was
        <p></p>stumped. "I'm really fine, you know?" he insisted. "If it was still painful, I wouldn't be
        <p></p>talking about going home to visit. As far as I'm concerned, it's in the past."
        <p></p>"…Liar."
        <p></p>"Liar? Listen here—"
        <p></p>"If you really were over it, you wouldn't be making that face."
        <p></p>Mahiru trembled slightly as she extended a hand toward Amane's cheek. Her eyes
        <p></p>were downcast, so he couldn't even see a reflection of his expression, but going off
        <p></p>what she said, it probably wasn't anything good.
        <p></p>"…If you don't want to say, that's fine. But it's painful for me to see you looking so hurt."
        <p></p>"Don't say that. It's not that big of a deal; it's not even an interesting story, okay?"
        <p></p>Amane insisted. "Are you still worried about it, even so?" he asked quietly, and Mahiru
        <p></p>nodded slightly.
        <p></p>Amane scratched his cheek and wondered what to do. He let out a soft sigh.
        <p></p>"Hmm… I wonder where I should begin. Well, I guess it makes sense to start with why
        <p></p>I wanted to leave my hometown, huh?"
        <p></p>"…Yes."
        <p></p>"It's because I wanted to get some distance from my friends… or I guess I should say
        <p></p>from the people who I thought were my friends."
        <p></p>It didn't sound like a very good reason for moving. Anyone else would probably think
        <p></p>he was worrying too much over something small.
        <p></p>And yet that time of his life was etched indelibly into Amane's memory.
        <p></p>"How should I put this…?" he began. "Well, I was blessed with a good home environment."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked a bit curious about this abrupt change in topic, but she must have
        <p></p>understood that this was necessary to understand the full story because she listened
        <p></p>quietly.
        <p></p>"I had relatives—my parents and grandparents—who loved me, and we were well-off.
        <p></p>Financially, I mean. They let me study and do whatever I wanted. I was very lucky, and
        <p></p>I know that."
        <p></p>His parents had been especially doting on him, since he was their only son, and they
        <p></p>had raised him in a way that respected Amane's individuality.
        <p></p>"But at that time, I wasn't really aware of how incredibly blessed I was, and I had never
        <p></p>learned to be suspicious of people. I was surrounded by good people and was raised
        <p></p>with love, so to be honest, I was a really naive child."
        <p></p>Now Amane was sulky, but before the incident took place, he had been so honest and
        <p></p>cheerful it was impossible to imagine, looking at him now. He had been a really
        <p></p>childish child.
        <p></p>"…I think that my naï vete made me especially easy to deceive and to use."
        <p></p>And so there had been many openings to take advantage of him.
        <p></p>"The new friends I made in the first half of middle school… I don't actually know if I
        <p></p>can honestly call them friends, but the guys who I started hanging out with… Well, to
        <p></p>tell the truth, they saw me as an easy mark, as a good source of money. When you come
        <p></p>from a well-off family, it's only human for people to want to get something out of you."
        <p></p>It sounded pathetic to say it, but back then, Amane had been honest to a fault and
        <p></p>incredibly gullible. In other words, he was easy to fool. He'd grown up believing in the
        <p></p>innate goodness of others, and nothing had ever challenged that redundant naï vete .
        <p></p>Nobody he knew would have ever tried to take advantage of him.
        <p></p>Mahiru's expression had grown stiff, so in order to try to relax her, Amane smiled and
        <p></p>said, "Of course, I wasn't a total fool, so I never directly gave them any money or
        <p></p>anything." But Mahiru's expression only got even more severe.
        <p></p>"And then, well, I discovered that they were saying all sorts of things behind my back.
        <p></p>They trashed my appearance. I heard them say I was gross and that they hated me and
        <p></p>had only ever intended to take me for all I was worth from the very beginning. I was
        <p></p>shocked and pretty depressed for a while."
        <p></p>People all have different preferences when it comes to who they get along with, and
        <p></p>Amane wouldn't have minded if they'd just said they didn't like him. But since they
        <p></p>thought they could get something out of him, they had all smiled to his face and abused
        <p></p>him in private, and that was something he couldn't bear.
        <p></p>He had told Mahiru the mild version of the story, but there had also been insults that
        <p></p>would be difficult to repeat, so he had really endured a lot. Now he would be able to
        <p></p>shrug off abuse like that, but at the time, he had been an earnest and sensitive boy, and
        <p></p>it had just been too much for him to bear.
        <p></p>"Of course, I knew that not everybody in the world was like those guys. I had a few
        <p></p>friends that I believe really liked me. Even so, once I started doubting people, fear took
        <p></p>over. I couldn't trust anyone."
        <p></p>He had shut himself up in his room for a while and cried.
        <p></p>He had eventually recovered, thanks to his parents' support, but as one might expect,
        <p></p>he was afraid to come into contact with those boys again, so he did every last possible
        <p></p>thing to avoid them for as long as he could—
        <p></p>"…And so I left my hometown. I left to get a fresh start in a place where no one knew
        <p></p>me. I left so I wouldn't be bothered by those guys anymore."
        <p></p>He hadn't known whether he could make it on his own, but he'd decided that his peace
        <p></p>of mind was worth the risk.
        <p></p>Thanks to everything that had happened, he could no longer easily trust people like
        <p></p>he once had and had grown into an introverted and skeptical young man who had just
        <p></p>finally managed to make two friends after taking ages to warm up to them. Amane had
        <p></p>to laugh at himself. For better or worse, he had become quite conservative, but at this
        <p></p>point, that attitude was deeply ingrained, and there was no changing it now.
        <p></p>Amane had finished talking, and Mahiru was trembling. Her hands were balled into
        <p></p>fists, and the emotion flickering in her eyes was unmistakably anger. Amane was
        <p></p>surprised to see the mild-mannered Mahiru get so enraged, and then he was even
        <p></p>more baffled when he realized that she was angry on his behalf, and that brought him
        <p></p>a little joy.
        <p></p>"…If I had been there, I would have punched those awful guys right in the face."
        <p></p>"Please, no; you would just hurt your own hand… And you don't have to get your hands
        <p></p>dirty for my sake, even in your imagination."
        <p></p>Those jerks weren't worth Mahiru getting her hands dirty—not even close. And
        <p></p>anyway, Amane had already cut them out of his life. It would be nothing but a waste
        <p></p>for Mahiru to even bother with them.
        <p></p>Mahiru relaxed a bit. She'd been squeezing her hands so hard they had started turning
        <p></p>white. Some of the anger faded from her face, replaced by an even deeper look of
        <p></p>sorrow.
        <p></p>When it came to Amane, Mahiru could be so compassionate it almost hurt. But this
        <p></p>incident was in the past, and Amane was embarrassed to have upset her over it.
        <p></p>"Really, it wasn't as agonizing as your situation, so you don't have to be so sad."
        <p></p>"Amane, it's not something that can be compared. I don't even want to try."
        <p></p>She cut him off flatly, and Amane frowned when he realized that had been rude, but
        <p></p>she looked at him and put on a calm expression.
        <p></p>"Let me say this—it's not that there's no value in sharing our experiences, but your
        <p></p>grief is your own, and it's something that only you can carry, and it can't be compared
        <p></p>to my grief. Nothing is better or worse. In the truest sense, I can't understand your
        <p></p>pain, Amane, nor can you understand mine."
        <p></p>"…Ah."
        <p></p>"What I can do is accept your sadness and support you… just like you've done for me.
        <p></p>I want to be there for you, and I want you to rely on me." Mahiru whispered this as she
        <p></p>placed the palms of her hands against both of Amane's cheeks.
        <p></p>He gradually felt a heat rising from the depths of his chest and behind his eyes. "…But
        <p></p>I already rely on you all the time," he said.
        <p></p>"Emotionally, I mean."
        <p></p>"I always rely on you."
        <p></p>"…Well, do it more."
        <p></p>"Don't spoil me, please."
        <p></p>"I'm going to. So, so much."
        <p></p>"I'm really not worth it."
        <p></p>"Why are you worried about that now? I've always known you were a hopeless case,
        <p></p>Amane."
        <p></p>He felt himself grimace when she casually delivered this harsh and yet undeniable
        <p></p>truth. But even though she sounded exasperated, Mahiru looked at him with gentle,
        <p></p>loving eyes that communicated the opposite.
        <p></p>"…But I also know you're a very good person, and you can endure a lot. Too much,
        <p></p>even," she continued. "You can at least let me spoil you a little."
        <p></p>Her sweet whispering voice, genuine and kind, threatened to obliterate what little
        <p></p>resistance Amane had left. He could imagine himself letting her spoil him forever, and
        <p></p>the thought struck a deep chord of fear within him, because he knew that if he let
        <p></p>himself grow too dependent on the girl he deeply loved, nothing would ever seem as
        <p></p>sweet.
        <p></p>For the sake of preserving what little dignity he had left, Amane slowly shook his head.
        <p></p>"Really, I'm fine," he insisted.
        <p></p>Mahiru batted her eyes and sighed dramatically. "…You're trying to act cool again," she
        <p></p>said wearily. "You big dummy."
        <p></p>Mahiru mocked him sweetly, then slipped her hands from Amane's cheeks around to
        <p></p>the back of his head. And then she pulled him toward her with all her strength.
        <p></p>Before he could react, Amane's face was pressed up against Mahiru's chest. He froze.
        <p></p>He could feel the softness of her skin and hear the beating of her heart, and when he
        <p></p>inhaled, his lungs were filled with her sweet scent—a mix of milk and some kind of
        <p></p>flower, with a little note of something bright, like green apple—and his mind was utter
        <p></p>chaos.
        <p></p>"Please, just let me spoil you," she said.
        <p></p>"…You're really forward" was the best answer his addled brain could muster.
        <p></p>But Mahiru's shoulders trembled with laughter. "Did you just realize that? Sometimes
        <p></p>girls can be very pushy, you know," she whispered impishly.
        <p></p>Fully aware of Amane's bewilderment, Mahiru gently wrapped her arms around his
        <p></p>back so he couldn't get away. Of course, she was still a slim young woman, so if Amane
        <p></p>wanted to shake free, he probably could have. However, the sweet scent and Mahiru's
        <p></p>warmth, plus her pleasant softness and the calming rhythm of her heartbeat, sapped
        <p></p>all of Amane's willpower to defy her.
        <p></p>"…Besides, I'm the type of person who always repays a debt," she whispered. Amane
        <p></p>had to fight to keep from losing himself in her warmth. "I relied on you before, Amane.
        <p></p>You spoiled me, too, remember? And now it's my turn, all right? Let me spoil you back.
        <p></p>It's the least I can do."
        <p></p>"…It's more than enough."
        <p></p>"Well then… Someday, when I'm feeling down again, you can be there for me, and that
        <p></p>will make us even." Her tone of voice was playful, and it was clear she had no intention
        <p></p>of giving up.
        <p></p>Amane surrendered at last and leaned into Mahiru. But this time, he put his arm
        <p></p>around her back and made sure to lean against her shoulder, instead of her chest. It
        <p></p>was the best he could do.
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled at Amane's choice, then tightly embraced him and accepted his full
        <p></p>weight.
        <p></p>"This isn't right…"
        <p></p>Several dozen minutes had passed, though it felt like much longer for Amane. When
        <p></p>he raised his head and pulled away from her, his voice was cold and had an edge. He
        <p></p>wasn't angry at Mahiru, though. He was ashamed of himself, for taking advantage of
        <p></p>her kindness.
        <p></p>But Mahiru just smiled and showed no sign of concern. "Well, I do hate to see you
        <p></p>feeling sad, so… next time I'll try to spoil you even sooner."
        <p></p>"…That's not exactly what I meant…"
        <p></p>Amane caught himself glancing down at her chest again. He quickly averted his eyes.
        <p></p>She was being so kind to him, and he didn't want to be vulgar. He'd managed to keep
        <p></p>himself in check this time, but next time, he thought, he might not be able to save
        <p></p>himself so easily.
        <p></p>Mahiru trusted Amane. She wouldn't have embraced him if she wasn't comfortable
        <p></p>with him. But he was still somewhat surprised that she was being so insistent.
        <p></p>And although her tenderness had eased the pain of his old wounds, that only left him
        <p></p>free to focus on the new aching in his heart.
        <p></p>"Why do you always turn away from me?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"I don't know what to do with myself when you spoil me like that. I mean, I am a guy,
        <p></p>after all."
        <p></p>"I know that…"
        <p></p>"It's not clear that you do. Like, seriously."
        <p></p>She should be more careful, he thought. What if he had taken advantage of her and
        <p></p>rubbed his face wherever he pleased? What would she have done then? He wanted her
        <p></p>to understand that there were some lines she shouldn't let even him cross.
        <p></p>He wasn't confident he would be able to control himself the next time he was faced
        <p></p>with the temptation of being given the go-ahead to bury his face in the chest of the girl
        <p></p>he loved. Amane sighed. Mahiru was too trusting and would probably forgive him for
        <p></p>almost anything.
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes narrowed. She looked absolutely hurt.
        <p></p>"…Amane, I don't understand you at all."
        <p></p>"What about me?"
        <p></p>"Everything, all of it. You dummy."
        <p></p>Mahiru stood up from the sofa in an angry huff. Even her insults sounded adorable.
        <p></p>Leaving Amane to ponder her anger, she turned away and headed for the kitchen.
        <p></p>He watched her leave in a daze. She looked so small and unsteady, but just a moment
        <p></p>ago, she'd been supporting him.
        <p></p>"Amane, you're such an airhead sometimes." She kept on rebuking him in a quiet, angry
        <p></p>voice that she apparently didn't think he could hear, so Amane just watched her go
        <p></p>with a shrug and a smile—
        <p></p>"Even though I wouldn't do that for anyone but you."
        <p></p>And then his ears picked up another quiet grumble.
        <p></p>His breath caught in his throat.
        <p></p>For a second, his brain refused to process her words. It was so shocking to him.
        <p></p>He forced himself to take a shallow breath.
        <p></p>And then the intense surge of emotion swirling in his chest practically forced Amane
        <p></p>to his feet. He found himself reaching out toward her.
        <p></p>"…Hey, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"What is… it?"
        <p></p>Before she could turn around, Amane had wrapped Mahiru up in his arms, embracing
        <p></p>her tightly as though he were shielding her from the world. Mahiru's slender frame
        <p></p>began to tremble, and her voice wavered, but she didn't push him away or seem upset.
        <p></p>He could tell she was shaking with surprise.
        <p></p>Amane wrapped his arms around her delicate body. Just a moment ago, she had been
        <p></p>supporting him. Now he put his chin on top of her head so she couldn't turn around.
        <p></p>"…You didn't mind hugging from the front, but now that it's from behind, you're
        <p></p>spooked," Amane teased.
        <p></p>"Anyone would be surprised by being hugged so suddenly!"
        <p></p>"You're the one who said I could lean on you. Though I held back because I knew this
        <p></p>would happen… It's bad for my heart."
        <p></p>Amane hadn't meant for this to happen. He was going to let Mahiru go off and pout, but
        <p></p>when he'd heard what she'd said, he felt a sudden surge of emotion, embarrassment,
        <p></p>and elation all at once, and reason left him—and his body had sought out Mahiru of
        <p></p>its own accord.
        <p></p>Gently, yet tightly, like he didn't want to let her slip away, he held on to Mahiru, who
        <p></p>felt like she might shatter if he squeezed too hard.
        <p></p>Mahiru tried to wriggle her way around to face him, but Amane whispered into her
        <p></p>ear, "Don't turn around."
        <p></p>She hung her head. Her face was bright red, and he heard her mutter, "…You dummy."
        <p></p>…I am a dummy; you're absolutely right.
        <p></p>He couldn't deny it. Here he was, taking advantage of her kindness in a vulnerable
        <p></p>moment… He was certainly a bad person.
        <p></p>But Mahiru hadn't pulled away from his touch, and he was grateful for that at least. He
        <p></p>enjoyed her warmth as he pressed his face into her hair, just as she had done to him
        <p></p>earlier, when she was trying to get him to accept her generosity. The difference
        <p></p>between then and now, Amane thought, was that he knew how she would respond.
        <p></p>"Now do you understand how I was feeling before?" he asked.
        <p></p>"I—I do, but—"
        <p></p>The shrillness in her voice told him she was upset. Her ears were red, and even though
        <p></p>he couldn't actually tell from this angle, Amane had no doubt that her face had also
        <p></p>turned the same intense color.
        <p></p>Even Amane understood he had done something bad. He'd only done this because he
        <p></p>had been sure she wouldn't turn him down.
        <p></p>"…Um, so look. You really don't need to worry so much about me," he said. "It's not like
        <p></p>I'm dying from some terrible condition or something. And besides, I can be pretty
        <p></p>shameless, so if you spoil me too much, I'll end up taking advantage of your kindness."
        <p></p>Mahiru listened quietly to Amane's words, then let out a sigh. "…If you find it satisfying,
        <p></p>if it helps heal you, then I'm not going to refuse a hug."
        <p></p>She reached up with one hand and gently touched him on the arm. She didn't brush
        <p></p>him away or smack him; she simply placed her hand gently on his arm, as if to draw
        <p></p>him closer. Amane warned himself not to get too carried away, but he still pressed his
        <p></p>face into Mahiru's hair again.
        <p></p>"I'm a crafty guy, you know. I knew you would accept the burden, so I started relying
        <p></p>on you."
        <p></p>"What are you talking about? I've always known you're trouble."
        <p></p>Amane knew his recent actions had stemmed from his own cowardice, but he wasn't
        <p></p>quite sure what she meant by trouble.
        <p></p>"…I feel like there's something you want to say to me…"
        <p></p>"Yes, if you have any self-awareness at all, then it's time to shape up and fly right. My
        <p></p>heart really can't take any more of this."
        <p></p>"I really don't have a clue what you're talking about," Amane protested.
        <p></p>"Mm-hmm," Mahiru hummed, then slapped Amane on the arm. It didn't hurt, and he
        <p></p>laughed quietly at her playful attack.
        <p></p>"I'm sorry for being so much trouble."
        <p></p>"…Well, if you're going to be trouble anyway, you might as well go all the way."
        <p></p>"But… What you were saying earlier…"
        <p></p>"That was that, and this is this."
        <p></p>"Oh…?"
        <p></p>He wasn't sure what Mahiru meant, but she certainly seemed to have something in
        <p></p>mind, so far be it from Amane to argue.
        <p></p>If Mahiru thought he seemed troublesome, then he probably was. But he didn't know
        <p></p>how to respond when she told him to up the ante.
        <p></p>"I can be crafty, too, you know," Mahiru said. "So I suppose I really don't have much
        <p></p>room to complain."
        <p></p>"In what way, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Hmm, I wonder?"
        <p></p>He felt her body tremble slightly with laughter.
        <p></p>"If you haven't realized yet that I also have a few tricks up my sleeve, you still have a
        <p></p>long way to go, Amane."
        <p></p>Even though Amane couldn't see her face, it was clear she was laughing gleefully.
        <p></p>Gracefully, she slipped out of his arms and whirled around to face him.
        <p></p>Her expression when she did was vibrant, and mischievous, and tender, and sweet—
        <p></p>a lovely and beautiful smile that would enchant anyone who saw it. Amane was
        <p></p>speechless.
        <p></p>When she saw Amane like that, Mahiru seemed satisfied, and she turned and headed
        <p></p>for the kitchen in her usual high spirits.
        <p></p>Amane watched her leave the room and then collapsed onto the sofa.
        <p></p>…You're a big dummy, too, you know.
        <p></p>What was she trying to do, flashing him a look like that? He didn't think he could string
        <p></p>together the words to ask her. All he could do was sit there, grumbling quietly.
        <p></p>But the pain in the depths of his chest was gone.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 38: Parental Concern and a Passing Pain 
        <p></p>…Mom, you can't just send Mahiru photos like that."
        <p></p>On the last day of Golden Week, Amane phoned his mother.
        <p></p>He was ostensibly calling to ask whether she would be at home on Mother's Day, but
        <p></p>before he could do that, he felt the need to stress his objection to her going behind his
        <p></p>back to send Mahiru photos of him. Nothing disastrous had slipped through the cracks
        <p></p>just yet, but this was his mother he was dealing with, and he knew if Mahiru asked,
        <p></p>she would absolutely send something mortifying.
        <p></p>So Amane rushed through the typical greetings and right into sullenly hurling
        <p></p>accusations.
        <p></p>"Uh-oh, you caught me," his mother replied in an indifferent tone.
        <p></p>She definitely was not remorseful.
        <p></p>"Mahiru was acting suspicious, so I questioned her, and then I saw the photos."
        <p></p>"Mahiru really needs to work on her poker face, huh?"
        <p></p>"Say you're sorry for sending them."
        <p></p>Thanks to Shihoko, Mahiru's image folder was full of all kinds of strange pictures, and
        <p></p>he was worried what else might make its way to her. For some reason, Mahiru seemed
        <p></p>to enjoy the photos, and rather than forcing her to stop looking at them, he had
        <p></p>decided it would be faster to go right to the root of the problem.
        <p></p>But his mother didn't seem the least bit ashamed. "What's so wrong about sending
        <p></p>photos of my adorable son to my adorable future daughter-in-law?"
        <p></p>"I don't even know where to start correcting everything wrong with that sentence…
        <p></p>Anyway, don't send stuff I haven't okayed."
        <p></p>"So if I get your permission, it's fine, right? The photos made Mahiru very happy, you
        <p></p>know."
        <p></p>"At least give me a chance to choose which ones you can send. I'd die if I found out
        <p></p>you'd sent anything embarrassing."
        <p></p>"Don't worry, I won't send any pictures of you in the bath."
        <p></p>"If you do, I'm boycotting Mother's Day." Amane scowled at his smartphone as he
        <p></p>delivered his ultimatum. His mother wasn't on hand to feel his wrath directly, so that
        <p></p>would have to do.
        <p></p>She obviously did not appreciate how upset he was, because she laughed gaily at his
        <p></p>demand. Before Amane could raise his eyebrows and go off on her again, she added,
        <p></p>"One way or another, you always show your appreciation for me every year, don't you?"
        <p></p>When Amane heard that, he held back his complaints.
        <p></p>"…I mean, yeah, you're my mom."
        <p></p>Of course, she could be irritating and obstinate, and sometimes he got completely fed
        <p></p>up with her, but his mother had carried him in her belly, given birth to him, lovingly
        <p></p>raised him to be healthy—and she did it all with plenty of love, so naturally he was
        <p></p>grateful to her.
        <p></p>Thanks to his parents, Amane had grown up okay and had rebounded whenever he'd
        <p></p>gotten hurt. He had turned out a little sulky, though.
        <p></p>But since it was embarrassing for a young man of his age to express gratitude directly
        <p></p>to his mother's face, he faltered a little.
        <p></p>His mother laughed cheerfully, as if she could see straight through her son. "It makes
        <p></p>a mother happy to see that she's raised a good child. I'm looking forward to this year's
        <p></p>flowers."
        <p></p>"…Yeah."
        <p></p>"Also, make sure you invite sweet Mahiru here for the summer, okay? I'm looking
        <p></p>forward to it."
        <p></p>His mother was obviously excited for his homecoming.
        <p></p>"Got it," Amane replied curtly, and he was treated to another laugh. "Well, Mahiru wants
        <p></p>to come anyway," he continued. "It seems like she's looking forward to it as well."
        <p></p>"It sounds like you are, too, Amane."
        <p></p>"Oh, be quiet."
        <p></p>He was excited about the prospect of spending the summer with Mahiru, but he didn't
        <p></p>appreciate being teased about it by his own mother.
        <p></p>Suddenly, Amane was in a bad mood, but Shihoko didn't seem to notice. On the other
        <p></p>end of the line, he could hear the peals of her cheerful laughter.
        <p></p>"Heh-heh. That's great. It sounds like you're okay with the idea of returning home."
        <p></p>"…I guess so."
        <p></p>She was probably thinking of the summer after his first year away, when he had
        <p></p>resisted going home during the break.
        <p></p>Now Amane was more positive about going home than he had once been. It wasn't
        <p></p>that he had forgotten the past. Even though he had experienced certain hardships, he
        <p></p>could see now that it had probably been for the best. Things were much better than
        <p></p>they would have been if he had stayed so trusting and good-natured, thus inevitably
        <p></p>exploited for all he was worth. More importantly, if he hadn't escaped those guys, he
        <p></p>never would have met Mahiru.
        <p></p>"If I let what happened derail my life any more than it already has, Mahiru would kill
        <p></p>me. So yeah, it pretty much doesn't bother me anymore."
        <p></p>"You told Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Yeah."
        <p></p>"That's wonderful. That's one more person who really understands you."
        <p></p>His mother sounded very happy, and Amane felt his chest grow just a little bit warm.
        <p></p>"…Sure."
        <p></p>"So that must mean those photos of you from middle school I had held back on sending
        <p></p>are fair game. I've got one from when you hit your growth spurt. You looked so smug
        <p></p>because you'd gotten taller than me. And that's just the beginning!"
        <p></p>"Hey, listen, I'm not kidding. Cut it out, all right? You've got some awful stuff in reserve."
        <p></p>All the warm feelings he'd had toward his mother evaporated.
        <p></p>"But you were so cuuute!"
        <p></p>"Dammit. This time, when I come home, I'm taking those out of the album."
        <p></p>"I've got that album hidden," Shihoko countered. "So they'll be fine."
        <p></p>"I'm definitely going to find it," he insisted.
        <p></p>He had to dispose of the photos before Mahiru saw them. He could just imagine Mahiru
        <p></p>grinning as she told him what she thought of them after his mother smuggled them
        <p></p>into her hands behind his back.
        <p></p>He could hear Shihoko laughing at him on the other end of the line, and with a curt
        <p></p>good-bye, he hung up on her, sighing angrily.
        <p></p>"…What are you doing?" a quiet voice asked. He turned to see Mahiru, peeking
        <p></p>inquisitively at him from the living room door. It looked like she had heard him talking
        <p></p>and tried not to make any noise as she entered the apartment.
        <p></p>Amane averted his eyes. "I was talking to my mom, telling her how I've decided to
        <p></p>completely destroy her photo albums. Scorched earth."
        <p></p>"Wh-what do you mean?! That'd be awful!" she exclaimed. She sat down next to him
        <p></p>in an angry huff and jabbed him in the shoulder.
        <p></p>Amane grimaced. "What are you even hoping to see, Mahiru…?"
        <p></p>"Photos of you, from long ago, of course…"
        <p></p>"No way."
        <p></p>"…You see? I have no choice but to get them from Shihoko, behind your back."
        <p></p>"Hey, listen—"
        <p></p>"I'm just joking. Well, half joking anyway."
        <p></p>"Geez… It's the other half that worries me, you know."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help but feel like if he dropped the matter, Mahiru would end up
        <p></p>plotting something with his mother behind his back. On the other hand, Mahiru was a
        <p></p>good person, and he trusted that, whatever happened, she wouldn't do anything too
        <p></p>outrageous.
        <p></p>Amane sighed dramatically, but Mahiru didn't seem bothered by it. Instead, she smiled
        <p></p>broadly, looking pleased. "…I don't think you're going to like this much, but I'm really
        <p></p>looking forward to summer vacation."
        <p></p>"You're kinda early," Amane replied. "Golden Week isn't even over yet."
        <p></p>"Well… I'm looking forward to seeing your mother and father again, and I can't wait to
        <p></p>check out your photo album, and I really want to see the place where you grew up with
        <p></p>my own eyes."
        <p></p>Amane felt his heart leap as she adorably rattled off her list, but she had added in one
        <p></p>item too many.
        <p></p>"Thanks… except for the album thing. The album is off-limits."
        <p></p>Mahiru gave him a peevish look when he shut her down, so he stroked her head to
        <p></p>distract her from the existence of the cursed photo album.
        <p></p>Mahiru apparently liked having her head stroked more than he had ever expected. She
        <p></p>still looked a tiny bit dissatisfied, but when he gently touched the top layer of her hair,
        <p></p>careful not to mess it up, she quickly settled down.
        <p></p>"…I'm looking forward to going home, too," Amane admitted.
        <p></p>"Really?" she asked.
        <p></p>"Why would I lie about that?"
        <p></p>"…I mean, with everything that happened…" Mahiru hesitated, probably recalling what
        <p></p>he had revealed to her yesterday.
        <p></p>"That thing with those guys doesn't really bother me anymore. Just the fact that you're
        <p></p>upset about something that happened to me really means a lot. How do I put this—? I
        <p></p>think I'm a pretty lucky guy to have someone who's willing to get genuinely angry on
        <p></p>my behalf."
        <p></p>He knew it was a small, simple thing, but just having someone who listened to him talk
        <p></p>about those old wounds—and be there to support him—had already gone a long way
        <p></p>toward helping him heal.
        <p></p>Besides, it was clear he couldn't carry on being depressed about it. Sooner or later, he
        <p></p>would exhaust Mahiru's patience with him, and he didn't want her to think he was
        <p></p>completely hopeless.
        <p></p>"It's only natural that I would be angry you were hurt, Amane. I mean, if someone was
        <p></p>to hurt me, you would be angry, right?"
        <p></p>"Of course I would."
        <p></p>"So it's the same thing," Mahiru asserted softly, letting her eyes drift closed. Amane
        <p></p>could tell how much she enjoyed it when he stroked her hair.
        <p></p>Amane felt a little embarrassed by how much she trusted him, but he continued gently
        <p></p>caressing her, and she smiled graciously and leaned against him.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 39: A Premonition of Trouble After the Holidays 
        <p></p>Golden Week, which had seemed both very long and painfully short, eventually came
        <p></p>to a close, and school began again.
        <p></p>…Finally, I can get some distance from Mahiru.
        <p></p>Mahiru had spent nearly the entire Golden Week at Amane's apartment. He'd said it
        <p></p>was okay, was grateful she had made their delicious meals, and was happy to spend
        <p></p>time with the girl he loved.
        <p></p>But ever since the day Amane had told Mahiru about his troubled past, his feelings for
        <p></p>her had only grown, and now he found it almost impossible to calm his turbulent
        <p></p>emotions.
        <p></p>Mahiru trusted Amane wholeheartedly. She spoiled him, certainly, but in a way she
        <p></p>also took advantage of him, testing the limits of his emotional fortitude. And knowing
        <p></p>he was the only one allowed to touch her sent his feelings into overdrive.
        <p></p>Really, he thought, I deserve some kind of award for self-control. If only I didn't have to
        <p></p>hold back, I bet I could ask her out. I might even get a good answer—
        <p></p>Mahiru had been so accepting of Amane, but he knew he didn't have the guts to tell
        <p></p>her how he felt. Just the thought of her rejection made him want to curl up and die. He
        <p></p>knew he was a coward, too afraid to make a move. But perhaps he was even more
        <p></p>afraid of what might happen if she didn't reject him, if by some chance she felt the
        <p></p>same way about him. He didn't think he was good enough to be her boyfriend.
        <p></p>…I've got a lot of work to do.
        <p></p>There wasn't anything he could do about his face, but he wanted to improve himself
        <p></p>wherever he could—physically and mentally. At least enough so no one would talk
        <p></p>behind their backs when he was with her—enough so Mahiru wouldn't be ashamed
        <p></p>of being with him.
        <p></p>And even if it turned out Mahiru didn't like him that way, it didn't hurt to try. He'd
        <p></p>never get anywhere if he didn't give it his best.
        <p></p>As he made up his mind to ask Yuuta, the lean, athletic track-and-field star, for some
        <p></p>training recommendations, Amane passed through the school gates and reached the
        <p></p>shoe lockers, where he caught sight of a familiar face.
        <p></p>"Mornin'…" Itsuki was groggily changing into his indoor slippers. He gave a puzzled
        <p></p>frown when he saw Amane. "…What's with that face?"
        <p></p>"That's my line," Amane said. "And anyway, what face?"
        <p></p>"Well, umm… How do I put this? You look like you've made a big decision. You finally
        <p></p>decide to tell her how you feel?"
        <p></p>Amane gave Itsuki an incredulous look. "Hmph. Yeah, right!" But his friend hadn't been
        <p></p>that far off the mark.
        <p></p>Itsuki stared at him with genuine curiosity. "Huh, well then, what is it? I thought there
        <p></p>would have been some kind of progress by now."
        <p></p>"P-progress? All right, look—"
        <p></p>"I was sure you'd finally grown a pair and decided to approach her like a man for a
        <p></p>change."
        <p></p>"Damn, no need to be an ass! Anyway… I was just thinking about how I have a lot of
        <p></p>work to do if I'm ever gonna get her to like me back."
        <p></p>"Hmm. In other words, over the break, after we went to karaoke… something did
        <p></p>happen! You're really going for it, eh?!" Itsuki chuckled.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't think of a clever comeback.
        <p></p>Itsuki slapped his friend on the back as he laughed. "Well, I know you hate me prying,
        <p></p>so I'll let you off the hook… But if there's anything I can help you with, I will, okay?"
        <p></p>"Itsuki…"
        <p></p>"And we can think about double dates, okay?"
        <p></p>"Ah, so that's what you're really after," Amane joked. He knew Itsuki was only trying to
        <p></p>lighten the mood.
        <p></p>Itsuki cackled and smacked Amane's back again. "Yeah, that's the dream, huh…?"
        <p></p>Humor was Itsuki's way of cheering him up.
        <p></p>Amane smiled at his friend, feeling just a little bit more optimistic. "Whatever you say,
        <p></p>man."
        <p></p>When Amane and Itsuki reached their classroom, there was some kind of clamor going
        <p></p>on. The commotion wasn't directed at the two of them, but the lively atmosphere was
        <p></p>so different from normal that Amane couldn't hide his bewilderment.
        <p></p>After a long break, it was normal for the classroom to be bustling with stories of
        <p></p>vacation, but today it was filled with a different kind of noise—the bustle of people
        <p></p>passing rumors. Amane strained his ears to listen in as he unloaded his bags at his
        <p></p>seat—and it seemed they were all discussing Mahiru.
        <p></p>"I heard that Shiina went on a date the other day with a cool-looking guy!"
        <p></p>What he overheard made Amane's cheek twitch violently.
        <p></p>They'd gone to crowded places, so there had always been a possibility that someone
        <p></p>would see them. But Amane had never imagined it would literally become the talk of
        <p></p>the classroom. He didn't mind the part about looking cool, but the rest of it immediately
        <p></p>set him on edge.
        <p></p>Itsuki had obviously overheard the same thing and was sitting there doing a very bad
        <p></p>job of not smiling. Amane would have liked to give him a good punch in the arm.
        <p></p>As they whispered about the rumors, all the girls kept glancing over at Mahiru.
        <p></p>"I heard they were strolling around arm in arm, and she was wearing a smile no one's
        <p></p>ever seen at school before… It must have been the guy everyone was talking about at
        <p></p>the start of the year."
        <p></p>"She says she's not dating anyone, but there's no doubt now…"
        <p></p>Mahiru, who had come to school early, as always, was preparing for first period. She
        <p></p>either didn't realize the rumors were about her, or more likely, she did realize and was
        <p></p>trying to ignore them.
        <p></p>She had to be used to the attention, thanks to her beauty and grace, but that day there
        <p></p>were more than the usual number of eyes peering in her direction, filled with
        <p></p>questions. And aside from the curious stares of the girls, she was getting looks of dead
        <p></p>despair from the boys.
        <p></p>If it bothered Mahiru, she certainly didn't show it. She stubbornly maintained her
        <p></p>usual angelic demeanor.
        <p></p>Eventually, a few of the girls in the class couldn't contain their curiosity any longer and
        <p></p>gingerly approached her.
        <p></p>"Hey, hey, Shiina?" one of the girls asked timidly.
        <p></p>Mahiru slowly batted her eyes. "Yes, did you need something?" She was acting like she
        <p></p>had no idea what the girls wanted.
        <p></p>"Well, the other day, I think I saw you walking through the shopping mall with a guy."
        <p></p>"Yes, I did walk through the mall," Mahiru confirmed.
        <p></p>A wave of murmuring went through the class. Obviously, everyone had been wondering
        <p></p>if the rumors were true. Amane, at the center of the scandal, felt sick to his stomach.
        <p></p>"Um, so that guy… What kind of relationship…?"
        <p></p>"What kind of relationship do we have?" Mahiru interrupted. "Well, if I had to say, I
        <p></p>think calling us friends would describe it best."
        <p></p>Amane was glad Mahiru had answered honestly, but his stomach still felt like it was
        <p></p>tied in knots. His classmates continued to mutter among themselves. He wished they
        <p></p>would all just mind their own business, but there was little he could do about it. Several
        <p></p>of the other boys in class seemed very relieved by Mahiru's answer, undoubtedly for
        <p></p>different reasons than Amane.
        <p></p>"So it wasn't a date or anything?"
        <p></p>"A date…?" Mahiru thought for a moment. "Well, when I consider the definition of a
        <p></p>date, I think it counts."
        <p></p>It was not the answer he had been expecting. In the strictest sense, a date was when
        <p></p>two or more people picked a place and time to meet up, so she wasn't exactly wrong…
        <p></p>But it was pretty obvious that was not what the girls had meant.
        <p></p>The small crowd shrieked as their excitement peaked.
        <p></p>From Amane's perspective, it seemed like since time immemorial, girls loved getting
        <p></p>excited about other people's love affairs. Normally he didn't concern himself with that
        <p></p>kind of chatter, figuring it was just what girls did. But this time, he couldn't ignore their
        <p></p>gossip—because he was at the center of it.
        <p></p>"S-so what are you saying…?"
        <p></p>The same girl who had asked the previous questions inquired again. Her voice
        <p></p>trembled with a mix of curiosity and hope.
        <p></p>Mahiru glanced at Amane for a split second. That look, gentle but filled with hints of
        <p></p>passion, left him momentarily breathless. By the time he got ahold of himself, Mahiru
        <p></p>had already turned away.
        <p></p>Now Mahiru wore a gentle smile, full of warmth and affection, and clasped her hands
        <p></p>in front of her breast, as if she were tightly holding on to something very precious. Her
        <p></p>answer sent the class into chaos, and it shook Amane to his core.
        <p></p>"We're not dating, but to me… he is the most important person on earth."
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 40: The Angel’s Thoughts 
        <p></p>"We're not dating, but to me… he is the most important person on earth."
        <p></p>Mahiru had made that statement publicly, in front of their classmates. For the rest of
        <p></p>the day, Amane couldn't think about anything else or pay attention in class. He just
        <p></p>didn't know exactly what she'd meant by "important." Did she mean that they were
        <p></p>good friends, or affectionately close, or maybe—in a romantic sense?
        <p></p>The more he thought about it, the more anxiety and unease he felt, but the faintest
        <p></p>hope swirled in his chest. All day, he was overwhelmed by emotions he could not put
        <p></p>into words.
        <p></p>His friend Itsuki smiled at him, but didn't make any jokes or say anything about it.
        <p></p>Amane had little hope of figuring out what Mahiru was thinking on his own. He spent
        <p></p>the whole day irritated, wishing he could just ask her directly what she'd meant. But
        <p></p>he never got the chance at school.
        <p></p>When the two of them got back to Amane's apartment, he finally, timidly, asked
        <p></p>Mahiru.
        <p></p>She looked at him with a puzzled expression. "I wasn't lying, you know," she said
        <p></p>without hesitation. It sounded like she had no idea why he was asking.
        <p></p>Mahiru put on her apron to prepare dinner. She also put on a little smile, perhaps
        <p></p>aware of Amane's discomfort. "I'm fairly sociable, but my circle of friends is small. The
        <p></p>only people I can definitely say I'm close with are you, Chitose, and Akazawa. Of course,
        <p></p>all of you are important to me, but among the three of you, you're the one I'm closest
        <p></p>with and the one I feel most at ease with when we're together."
        <p></p>"Oh, um…"
        <p></p>Amane knew that what Mahiru was saying was true, but being told this face-to-face
        <p></p>felt very strange for some reason.
        <p></p>"We've spent the past half year or so together, and it has been a very meaningful time
        <p></p>for me. I've never been the type to get close to others, and you're the most comfortable,
        <p></p>most likable person I know," she said calmly and candidly.
        <p></p>Amane suppressed a groan as he looked into Mahiru's gentle eyes. She gazed back at
        <p></p>him.
        <p></p>"For me, the world is a small place," she continued. "I could count the people I like on
        <p></p>one hand, as if I'm living in a miniature garden… In my little world, you are the most
        <p></p>precious person to me. You're the one who told me that I'm okay just the way I am."
        <p></p>"Mahiru…"
        <p></p>"So I want you to be a little more confident in that regard, Amane."
        <p></p>Mahiru's cheeks reddened, coloring her shy expression, clearly showing that she was
        <p></p>stating her true feelings, but Mahiru didn't seem to notice.
        <p></p>The sincerity painted on her face caused conflicting emotions to well up inside
        <p></p>Amane—embarrassment and indescribable joy threatened to make his chest burst.
        <p></p>"After all, you already know that I trust you above anyone else. Did you think that there
        <p></p>was someone else that I liked?"
        <p></p>"That's not it, but… when you put it that way, you must have known how I would take
        <p></p>it, right?"
        <p></p>"That's exactly right," Mahiru answered with an unwavering smile.
        <p></p>Amane stared at Mahiru. "So when you dodged the question that way, you knew it
        <p></p>would open us up to insistent prying and suspicions of romance?"
        <p></p>Mahiru's smile broadened. She was oddly nonchalant. "That's also right."
        <p></p>"In that case, wouldn't it have been easier to manage the rumors by letting out a few
        <p></p>snippets of information at a slow trickle? If people are going to speculate, I think it
        <p></p>would be better to at least have some control over the direction the rumors take."
        <p></p>"…Indeed."
        <p></p>Amane knew that Mahiru had her own ways of thinking about these things, but to him,
        <p></p>it had been extraordinarily nerve-racking to hear her talk about him in public, even
        <p></p>indirectly.
        <p></p>In the end, there had been a big uproar after her statement, but Mahiru herself had
        <p></p>just calmly put on her angelic smile. The boys in love with Mahiru were probably
        <p></p>stressing out about it right now.
        <p></p>"Anyway, you should be more careful. If you don't say anything to me beforehand, I
        <p></p>might get the wrong idea, too."
        <p></p>"Get the wrong idea?"
        <p></p>"…Usually, if someone said something like that about me, I'd think what everyone else
        <p></p>is thinking."
        <p></p>Amane figured that Mahiru must like him in some way. Otherwise, she wouldn't be so
        <p></p>relaxed around him, or look at him with such trust in her eyes. But he couldn't figure
        <p></p>out the exact nature of her affection.
        <p></p>Was it the same kind of sentiment that Amane felt toward Mahiru, or was it something
        <p></p>more passionate?
        <p></p>The feelings he held were not something that he could easily put into words.
        <p></p>He didn't feel burning-hot passion, and it wasn't intense, heartrending yearning,
        <p></p>either. It was more like a quiet, gentle candle giving off a steady heat. Mahiru was the
        <p></p>first person for whom his heart had felt such affection and desire to treasure.
        <p></p>However, those weren't the kind of feelings that most friends of the opposite sex could
        <p></p>just openly talk about. Also, Amane didn't know if Mahiru felt the same way. For this
        <p></p>reason, he reminded himself to speak clearly, so as not to be misunderstood.
        <p></p>"I mean, if for example I were to announce that you were someone important to me,
        <p></p>with that kind of timing, you'd start getting ideas too, right?"
        <p></p>"But I don't think you would ever make such a declaration in the first place, Amane."
        <p></p>"Well, that's true, but—"
        <p></p>"Or are you saying that's what you're going to do?"
        <p></p>"I know that if I did, I'd wind up feeling like I decided to sit down on a bed of thorns."
        <p></p>I know for sure that people's thorny gazes would skewer me—no, they'd eviscerate me. I
        <p></p>would die by a thousand stares.
        <p></p>Amane waved his hand in front of his face. He had no intention of resigning himself to
        <p></p>such a fate without any sort of preparation.
        <p></p>Mahiru let a little giggle slip out.
        <p></p>"I know you're not the risk-taking type."
        <p></p>"…Somehow, I feel like that annoys you."
        <p></p>"You're imagining things."
        <p></p>Amane was pretty sure he was not imagining the look of exasperation on Mahiru's
        <p></p>face, but it seemed she didn't feel like explaining anything to him.
        <p></p>Mahiru let out a deep sigh, as if to vent her frustrations, and headed for the kitchen.
        <p></p>"…Um?"
        <p></p>"What is it?"
        <p></p>"If I did make some kind of public declaration, I think it would have a big effect on your
        <p></p>life, too… Are you prepared for that?"
        <p></p>"What a silly question. I would never suggest something if I wasn't ready to deal with
        <p></p>the consequences."
        <p></p>Amane was at a loss for words because she really said it without a second thought.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't so much as look his way and started setting out her cooking utensils
        <p></p>with a flourish of her apron hem.
        <p></p>"I understand that my social standing is different from yours, and that we receive very
        <p></p>different kinds of attention. I also understand that you won't say anything. And I don't
        <p></p>want to make you uncomfortable."
        <p></p>"…That's—"
        <p></p>"It's a real pain to be popular, you know. People are always watching how you act in
        <p></p>public and meddling in your affairs."
        <p></p>Mahiru grumbled to herself, and it was plain to see she was fed up with the attention.
        <p></p>Then she turned around to look at Amane.
        <p></p>"But here, it's just the two of us; there's no one to butt in. For now, I'm satisfied with
        <p></p>that."
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled coyly, and Amane couldn't do anything but stare at her beautiful smile,
        <p></p>unable to say anything more.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 41: The Angel’s Risky Proposal 
        <p></p>A new day had dawned since Mahiru's shocking statement, but the excitement over
        <p></p>the angel's new relationship hadn't settled down at all in class.
        <p></p>Her words had attracted considerable curiosity, since up to now, she hadn't shown any
        <p></p>interest in boys and had treated members of both sexes the same.
        <p></p>However, no matter what she was asked, Mahiru didn't answer with any additional
        <p></p>information. Her closest friend, Chitose, also insisted that she didn't know anything,
        <p></p>so whoever Mahiru had alluded to remained unknown.
        <p></p>As the boy in question, Amane was relieved by this, but at the same time, he was
        <p></p>terrified, wondering when he would be exposed.
        <p></p>"Well, I think if someone got a reeeally good look at your face, they'd figure it out. But
        <p></p>from a distance, just looking at your silhouette, I doubt anyone would recognize you,"
        <p></p>Itsuki said, laughing at Amane's concern as he looked over the merchandise for sale.
        <p></p>Amane had brought Itsuki and Yuuta along with him to the sports equipment store.
        <p></p>He was there to buy some exercise gear, after deciding that he should start training
        <p></p>and exercising to better complement Mahiru, and so that she might fall for him. The
        <p></p>impact of her statement had sparked the idea.
        <p></p>Club activities were suspended for the time being due to upcoming exams, so the track
        <p></p>and field club ace had some free time and accompanied Amane to help him pick out
        <p></p>running shoes.
        <p></p>"I mean, after all, you usually have a plain hairstyle and act all indifferent, so you come
        <p></p>off as cold, and your expression doesn't really change," Itsuki said. "But when you're
        <p></p>with her, you make all sorts of faces, and you actually look up from the ground, so you
        <p></p>seem sweet and gentle. I don't think anyone would connect that guy with the Amane
        <p></p>we see at school."
        <p></p>"You're pretty easy to read, Fujimiya; it's surprising," Yuuta added.
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>Amane was aware that he acted more gently toward Mahiru than other people, but it
        <p></p>was still embarrassing to hear someone point it out like that.
        <p></p>It was all the more humiliating to know that even Yuuta, who he had just started
        <p></p>hanging out with, could see it.
        <p></p>Amane frowned, trying to shake off the embarrassment. Itsuki looked at him with a
        <p></p>foolish grin.
        <p></p>"Looks like my prediction was right, that you would change when you found a girl you
        <p></p>liked."
        <p></p>"…Shut up."
        <p></p>"Oooh, you are sooo cute when you're trying not to look embarrassed, Amane!"
        <p></p>"Don't be a creep, Itsuki."
        <p></p>"It is a little creepy, Itsuki."
        <p></p>"Why are you on his side, Yuuta? You're supposed to stick with me."
        <p></p>"Well, it's… you know."
        <p></p>"I'm gonna cry, guys."
        <p></p>Itsuki did not seem like he was going to cry at all. After grinning and poking at Amane
        <p></p>for a while, he shrugged. "Well, I guess she really does have all sorts of troubles of her
        <p></p>own, huh? Including yesterday's performance."
        <p></p>"…Performance? She told me she did it to control the rumors as best she could without
        <p></p>telling any lies, since she was under suspicion anyway."
        <p></p>"Ah, is that how she explained it? Well, that's all true, but I think it was also an attempt
        <p></p>to repel other guys without inviting hostility from other girls. When you're popular,
        <p></p>you're always the object of jealousy, more or less. By hinting that she's got a special
        <p></p>someone, and that she hasn't got eyes for anyone else, she's saying that even if she
        <p></p>hangs around Yuuta and us once in a while, she's not interested."
        <p></p>"I see."
        <p></p>"Plus, you know, to keep it all in check."
        <p></p>"What do you mean?"
        <p></p>"…Ah, it's nothing. Forget it. Setting all that aside, I can see in your eyes that she's
        <p></p>important to you, and I think she probably feels the same way. You can win her over if
        <p></p>you push, or even better, push her down, heh? It's important for a guy to take a little
        <p></p>initiative, you know!"
        <p></p>The words "push her down" made Amane recall the situation that happened over
        <p></p>Golden Week.
        <p></p>I didn't mean to…
        <p></p>By accident, he had lost his balance and fallen on top of her. It wasn't anything
        <p></p>intentional. There was no way he would have done it on purpose, being fully aware
        <p></p>that Mahiru would hate him if he did something as outrageous as that.
        <p></p>However, if Mahiru made the same expression next time, looking like she was waiting
        <p></p>for him to make some sort of move—he wasn't sure what he'd do then.
        <p></p>"…Hey, did something happen that I don't know about? Did you get lucky or
        <p></p>something?"
        <p></p>Itsuki made a grabbing motion with his hands, very interested now that Amane's
        <p></p>cheeks were gradually flushing with remembered shame.
        <p></p>"Just shut up for once!" Amane shouted.
        <p></p>"Itsuki, you're the worst!" Yuuta added.
        <p></p>"Whose side are you on, anyway?! I thought you were hoping for progress, Yuuta!"
        <p></p>"I don't want to be on your side when you're messing around like that. Though I do
        <p></p>think that Fujimiya is being too passive."
        <p></p>"As far as I can tell, you're both against me."
        <p></p>Amane had complex feelings about getting these evaluations from Yuuta and Itsuki.
        <p></p>On the other hand, he knew he wasn't particularly assertive, so he didn't feel like he
        <p></p>could make much of a rebuttal.
        <p></p>"Now, now, we just wanted to give you a little nudge," Yuuta insisted. "I don't know
        <p></p>Mahiru that well, so I'm just speculating, but I doubt she has feelings for anyone other
        <p></p>than you, Fujimiya. It seems like you're the only one she really trusts. After all, she
        <p></p>seems incredibly wary of most people. I'm telling you, the way that girl looks at you,
        <p></p>and only you, is different."
        <p></p>"…I know that she trusts me, and that she likes me as a person, but even so…"
        <p></p>"Why are you so negative? Have some confidence. You're a good guy, and you seem like
        <p></p>the kind of person who can put in some serious effort, so long as you have a goal. I
        <p></p>mean, look, if you really don't have any confidence, then start working out and get in
        <p></p>shape. Physical fitness is linked to emotional well-being, you know. If your body gets
        <p></p>fitter, your attitude should improve, and if your attitude improves, everything around
        <p></p>you will look brighter. By getting physically stronger, you can make yourself more
        <p></p>confident."
        <p></p>"You sound awfully self-assured."
        <p></p>"I read it in a book."
        <p></p>Yuuta seemed amused at reciting something he saw in a book once and passing it off
        <p></p>as if speaking from his own experience. He laughed playfully and clapped Amane on
        <p></p>the shoulder. "Well, you're tall, Fujimiya, so you'd look good if you filled out a little,
        <p></p>looked a little more balanced, you know? It would be a waste not to cultivate the good
        <p></p>features you were born with."
        <p></p>"…I'll try my best."
        <p></p>"You've got Yuuta to help you with the physical part, and me for the emotional part,"
        <p></p>Itsuki said. "The dream team!"
        <p></p>"I'm a little apprehensive about your advice…"
        <p></p>"How rude!"
        <p></p>"Just kidding… I trust you, somewhat."
        <p></p>"This guy just can't be honest with his feelings."
        <p></p>Itsuki ribbed Amane with his elbow. Amane deliberately ignored his very existence
        <p></p>and shifted his gaze back to Yuuta, who was smiling beside him.
        <p></p>Amane had already tried on and chosen some shoes, as well as the other things he
        <p></p>needed. Figuring they would be in the way if they lingered too long in the store, he
        <p></p>held up the merchandise in his hands to suggest that they hurry to the cashier.
        <p></p>"Kadowaki, should we go pay?"
        <p></p>"I guess you could. I thought I might get some new running wear, too."
        <p></p>"Isn't it a little cruel to ignore me, guys?"
        <p></p>Itsuki knew what they were up to, and shouted after them in a slightly disheartened
        <p></p>voice as they headed for the registers. Amane and Yuuta looked at each other and
        <p></p>laughed a little.
        <p></p>"…So what that means is, I'm going to do a little more exercise, so that will probably
        <p></p>increase the amount of time I'm out of the house."
        <p></p>After getting home and devouring the entire dinner that Mahiru had made, Amane
        <p></p>told her that he was going to be around the house less often.
        <p></p>Although his training would be something he did by himself, he figured that it would
        <p></p>inconvenience her if he didn't say anything, since they spent a lot of time together and
        <p></p>since she was in charge of fixing dinner.
        <p></p>Mahiru, who was relaxing comfortably on the sofa after dinner as usual, widened her
        <p></p>caramel-colored eyes in slight surprise at Amane's words.
        <p></p>"I'll adjust the menu to account for exercise, but… this is quite sudden. Exercising is
        <p></p>good, but what prompted this?"
        <p></p>"…I guess I just wanted to improve myself a little more, as a guy," Amane deflected.
        <p></p>Naturally, there was no way he could tell her openly that it was because he wanted her
        <p></p>approval, or that he wanted to look as good as she did, or that he wanted her to find
        <p></p>him attractive.
        <p></p>Mahiru's laughing rang like a clear and beautiful bell. "My goodness, that's a line I
        <p></p>never thought I'd hear from the Amane who was living a slovenly life until half a year
        <p></p>ago."
        <p></p>"Come on, don't make fun of me… There's no harm in focusing more on my studies, my
        <p></p>fitness, or my appearance."
        <p></p>"Well, that's true, but…"
        <p></p>Amane let his eyes wander. Mahiru's gaze implied that she was surprised to hear
        <p></p>something like this coming from him, but she didn't seem like she was going to
        <p></p>question him any further.
        <p></p>Mahiru had an exasperated but somewhat charming smile, and she poked Amane's
        <p></p>cheek with her fingertip teasingly.
        <p></p>"…Just don't overdo it, all right? You're an overachiever, Amane. I know that once you
        <p></p>decide to do something, you follow through, so please ask someone for help if it looks
        <p></p>like you might get carried away."
        <p></p>"I'm not worried about that. I've got a trainer."
        <p></p>"Kadowaki?"
        <p></p>"He's not an actual instructor, but he can teach me all sorts of basic things."
        <p></p>"I guess that makes me your personal chef. I'll think carefully about nutritional
        <p></p>balance when I make your meals."
        <p></p>If Amane was going to start exercising and getting in shape, then naturally he would
        <p></p>need to change his diet, too. Since he was already skinny, he knew he needed to put on
        <p></p>some weight, which meant eating more in general. That in turn meant more work for
        <p></p>Mahiru.
        <p></p>Amane knew he depended on Mahiru for most of his meals, so he felt bad about asking
        <p></p>even more from her, but she accepted the challenge without so much as a sour look.
        <p></p>"Sorry for causing you all sorts of trouble."
        <p></p>"No, if you've made up your mind, I'll be glad to help and cheer you on, but… you
        <p></p>mustn't forget that first we have exams to get through, all right?"
        <p></p>"I haven't forgotten. I've been reviewing every day."
        <p></p>"That's great."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't summon the willpower to shake her off as she patted his head and
        <p></p>praised him in a soft voice that oozed sweetness.
        <p></p>But he also had mixed feelings about not putting up any resistance, so he shot her a
        <p></p>slightly reproachful look.
        <p></p>"…Don't make fun of me. I'm perfectly capable of balancing my studies with my
        <p></p>training."
        <p></p>Amane was earnest by nature and took his classes seriously. He was the type who
        <p></p>could mostly grasp the material just by sitting through the lesson. Since he also never
        <p></p>failed to review and prepare at home, he basically had no worries when it came to
        <p></p>academics.
        <p></p>He wouldn't be neglecting his studies just by diverting a little of that energy to
        <p></p>exercise. In fact, he intended to get more serious about his studies as well. He was
        <p></p>determined not to fall behind in either department, lest he fail to keep up with Mahiru.
        <p></p>"You'll tire yourself out doing that. Shall I pamper you once for good luck?"
        <p></p>"Look here—"
        <p></p>"Well, should you ever request it, I'll pamper you any time, so—" Mahiru patted her
        <p></p>chest reassuringly and smiled.
        <p></p>The memory of burying his face in the soft flesh there the other day made Amane press
        <p></p>his lips together.
        <p></p>Mahiru had only embraced him in an attempt to console him when he seemed down,
        <p></p>but it was the sort of gesture that had particular significance to a boy of his age. At the
        <p></p>time, he had been so caught up in his emotions that he had been more preoccupied
        <p></p>with the kindness she had shown him than the physical sensations of the embrace.
        <p></p>Next time, Amane knew he would take in and savor the feeling of her body. Precisely
        <p></p>because he was aware of how shameless that would be, he wanted to refrain.
        <p></p>"…It's frightening how you seem willing to do anything I ask," he muttered.
        <p></p>"I mean, if it's something I'm able to do, I'll do what I can. Of course, I expect to be
        <p></p>repaid, though."
        <p></p>"I think I would feel even worse if you did all sorts of things for me without any
        <p></p>expectation of repayment."
        <p></p>"But when it comes to acts of selfless love and altruism, in most cases, a sense of
        <p></p>emotional satisfaction is pretty much the only compensation, right?"
        <p></p>"Incidentally, how do you want me to thank you?"
        <p></p>"…I'd like you to listen to a request of mine."
        <p></p>This was Mahiru, so Amane wasn't expecting her to ask for money or anything, but he
        <p></p>snickered unintentionally at the sweet way she asked for such vague restitution.
        <p></p>"Sure, as long as it's something I'm able to do. Any kind of fair exchange."
        <p></p>"My request is pretty selfish."
        <p></p>"Somehow I doubt that."
        <p></p>"It really is… You can only say that because you don't know the true extent of my
        <p></p>selfishness."
        <p></p>"All right, let's hear it, then. What's your request?" Amane figured that if she was
        <p></p>making such a big deal about it, it must be something major. He was curious to know
        <p></p>what a big request from Mahiru might be.
        <p></p>Mahiru's face stiffened slightly.
        <p></p>When Amane stared directly into her pretty caramel-colored eyes, wondering what on
        <p></p>earth she was about to say, she started to let her gaze wander.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't make out whether Mahiru's wish was truly something so significant
        <p></p>that she was hesitant to say it out loud, or if she was just putting on an act.
        <p></p>He stared intently at her as her cheeks gradually reddened.
        <p></p>"Well…"
        <p></p>"Yes?"
        <p></p>"Umm, it's…"
        <p></p>"It's…?"
        <p></p>"…A-Amane, I want you to pat my head, too."
        <p></p>Without meaning to, Amane smiled stiffly at Mahiru, who had started to say something
        <p></p>else, and helplessly made that desperate plea in her panic to avoid voicing her original
        <p></p>request.
        <p></p>"Is that what you're going with? There was something else you were about to say,
        <p></p>wasn't there?"
        <p></p>"It's fine."
        <p></p>He was curious to know what she had been about to say, but thought it would put her
        <p></p>in a bad mood if he pressed anymore, so he left it there and extended a hand.
        <p></p>He did pat her head occasionally, but it was rare for Mahiru herself to ask for it. He
        <p></p>would do this sort of thing anytime she asked without expecting anything in return,
        <p></p>and in fact, he very much enjoyed it, so long as Mahiru didn't hate it. But he did find it
        <p></p>adorable that she had humbly asked for it out loud.
        <p></p>The tension visibly left Mahiru's face as Amane stroked her head just as she had
        <p></p>requested.
        <p></p>"I don't know what part of this is supposed to be selfish, though."
        <p></p>"It is selfish. Because I want you to touch me more."
        <p></p>"Touch you?"
        <p></p>Amane's movements stiffened. Before he noticed her moving, Mahiru was looking up
        <p></p>at him with her usual soft face and glistening eyes.
        <p></p>"I like it when you touch me, Amane. I don't usually enjoy making physical contact with
        <p></p>people, but I think your hands feel nice."
        <p></p>"Is that… so?"
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed oblivious to the implications of what she'd just said. She was wearing
        <p></p>her usual gentle expression as she nudged closer to him, pleadingly.
        <p></p>As the distance between them narrowed, Amane could smell her sweet scent more
        <p></p>clearly, and his heartbeat inevitably quickened.
        <p></p>…I think this girl might be trying to kill me.
        <p></p>Any normal guy would count himself lucky to hear the girl he liked say that she wanted
        <p></p>him to touch her; he'd probably go ahead and do it, knowing what he was getting into.
        <p></p>Amane was a healthy young man, and the invitation was very tempting, but he also
        <p></p>knew that Mahiru was so affectionate with him because of how deeply she trusted
        <p></p>him.
        <p></p>"You don't touch me often, Amane, but when you do, you do it in a way that's gentle
        <p></p>and thoughtful, don't you? It's really calming, and it feels nice. I think you emit a
        <p></p>soothing aura or something."
        <p></p>Mahiru was probably teasing Amane, at least a little.
        <p></p>"…It's not all that relaxing for me, you know. You're a girl, Mahiru, so it's not like I can
        <p></p>touch you thoughtlessly."
        <p></p>"I don't mind."
        <p></p>"I do. Let me try telling you to touch me; I bet you'll feel uncomfortable."
        <p></p>He cautioned against it a little too strongly—deep down, he was still feeling insecure
        <p></p>about the fact that she didn't seem to think of him as a real man.
        <p></p>In response, he got a placid smile and the question, "…Will you touch me?"
        <p></p>It felt like she was carelessly trying to provoke him. Against his better judgment, he
        <p></p>pinched Mahiru's squishy cheeks. In a sense, he did touch her as asked, but the
        <p></p>dissatisfaction on Mahiru's face was evident.
        <p></p>"Come on, I won't mention it outside this apartment, and I won't ask the same of
        <p></p>anyone but you, Amane…"
        <p></p>"Absolutely not, don't be ridiculous."
        <p></p>Amane didn't mean it that way, but his answer came out almost in a growl, filled with
        <p></p>emotion. He was flustered, hearing words that she would only say to him.
        <p></p>Amane was frantically trying to get ahold of himself and all the unspeakable thoughts
        <p></p>that were filling his mind. He cupped Mahiru's hands in his. That was as much
        <p></p>touching as he could allow himself.
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked, fluttering her long eyelashes, and gave Amane a gentle smile that
        <p></p>looked just a little embarrassed. He could clearly see relief and happiness in her
        <p></p>expression, which made him feel embarrassed, too.
        <p></p>"…You feel warm. Speaking of, sometimes you get really warm."
        <p></p>"…I'll let go this instant."
        <p></p>"No, don't. As I expected, your hands are warm, and big, and rugged… very different
        <p></p>from mine."
        <p></p>"You're small, and dainty, and delicate, so I feel anxious touching you."
        <p></p>"I won't break that easily. Besides, when you touch me, you're always gentle. I can tell
        <p></p>right away that you would absolutely never hurt me."
        <p></p>"…I'd never be rough with any girl."
        <p></p>Amane was absolutely sure that he would never knowingly hurt the girl he wanted to
        <p></p>cherish forever. To him, she was someone very delicate who he wanted to protect from
        <p></p>harm.
        <p></p>Even though he knew she wasn't fragile, he carefully stroked the back of Mahiru's hand
        <p></p>as if he was touching a fragile piece of porcelain, and she narrowed her caramelcolored eyes as if it tickled.
        <p></p>"…That's exactly why I trust you and why I'm asking you to touch me." Mahiru smiled.
        <p></p>She was overwhelmingly lovely, and, suppressing the urge to embrace her right then
        <p></p>and there and make her his, Amane mirrored her smile.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 42: The Angel in the Dream, Feelings of Shame 
        <p></p>"…I love you."
        <p></p>A voice full of anticipation spoke these few, simple words.
        <p></p>Her voice was quiet as it left her soft, pink lips, and she approached him seductively.
        <p></p>Amane was propping himself up on the bed, and she lowered her hips onto his legs,
        <p></p>pinning him in place.
        <p></p>Strangely, he didn't feel any weight at all.
        <p></p>But the soft touch of her skin and her fragrant smell filled his senses.
        <p></p>Mahiru leaned coquettishly up against him and wrapped her arms around his back,
        <p></p>closing the gap between them as she cast her eyes down shyly. Amane looked down
        <p></p>and saw a fresh expanse of skin that normally never saw the light of day, peeking from
        <p></p>the neckline of her white dress.
        <p></p>He tried to avert his gaze from the deep valley between her breasts, but Mahiru moved
        <p></p>her hands from his back up to his neck and pulled his face closer, as if to tell him not
        <p></p>to look away.
        <p></p>A sigh escaped her lips.
        <p></p>"…Touch me more?" she whispered.
        <p></p>Amane wrapped his arms around her delicate back and slowly brought his lips
        <p></p>closer—
        <p></p>"—Ah?"
        <p></p>He sat up straight.
        <p></p>Amane was alone in his bedroom. The morning sun shone into the room through a gap
        <p></p>in the closed curtains.
        <p></p>When he looked at the clock on his side table, he saw that it was just past five.
        <p></p>With the approach of summer, the sun was rising earlier—it was early enough to get
        <p></p>a start on the day, although Amane certainly hadn't intended to wake up at this hour.
        <p></p>He pressed the palm of his hand against his face as he remembered what he'd been
        <p></p>dreaming about and was immediately overcome with shame.
        <p></p>This is the worst…
        <p></p>The dream had taken him by surprise.
        <p></p>Previously, when Mahiru had appeared in his dreams, she had behaved as usual—
        <p></p>never acting with such blatant desire. When she'd told him the day before that she
        <p></p>wanted him to touch her more, that must have provided the inspiration for his fantasy,
        <p></p>but even so, he felt ashamed. His mind had imagined Mahiru acting in ways she never
        <p></p>would. Even though it had only been a dream, he still felt guilty about having those
        <p></p>kinds of feelings toward her.
        <p></p>It was very frustrating—he wanted to cherish Mahiru and treat her respectfully, but
        <p></p>his subconscious mind apparently had other ideas. He had the fleeting temptation to
        <p></p>slam his head into the wall.
        <p></p>Amane decided that some exercise would be just the thing to clear his head. Pushing
        <p></p>away his subconscious desires, he made to leave his room, but paused on the way out.
        <p></p>"…Kill me now."
        <p></p>Before he could start the day, he was going to need a nice long shower to wash away
        <p></p>any lingering frustrations.
        <p></p>"Hey, Amane, what's with the dead expression?"
        <p></p>After getting up, Amane had gone for an early morning run to shake off his shame,
        <p></p>exhausting himself both physically and mentally. Chitose must have noticed, and
        <p></p>approached him during a break at school.
        <p></p>Amane looked at Itsuki, who was sitting beside him, to ask whether he looked that
        <p></p>lifeless, and Itsuki nodded.
        <p></p>"Ah, well… I went for a little run this morning," Amane explained.
        <p></p>"That'll wipe you out, no doubt." Chitose nodded. "A couch potato is sure to get groggy
        <p></p>when they finally start working out." Chitose cackled and grinned lightheartedly as
        <p></p>she slapped him on the back.
        <p></p>Amane was relieved that she didn't press him any further.
        <p></p>Telling Chitose something meant that Mahiru would know eventually anyway, so
        <p></p>Amane did his best to avoid telling her anything important. Honestly, he didn't want
        <p></p>to let anyone know about his dream.
        <p></p>"If you're not feeling well, you ought to go right home after school's over and rest. It's
        <p></p>best not to overdo it," Mahiru added, standing beside Chitose like her chaperone.
        <p></p>They were at school, so Mahiru was in her "angel mode," but her concern was genuine.
        <p></p>Amane had a feeling she was going to spoil him when they got home.
        <p></p>However, Amane knew that he wouldn't be able to accept her kindness—his lingering
        <p></p>guilt over the dream wouldn't even allow him to look Mahiru in the eye.
        <p></p>Without meeting her gaze, Amane responded flatly, "Thank you for your concern. I'm
        <p></p>fine, so there's no need to worry." He did his best not to allow any emotion to creep
        <p></p>into his words. From the corner of his eye, he could see Mahiru's expression stiffen
        <p></p>slightly.
        <p></p>Amane was trying not to let the awkwardness he felt every time he looked at Mahiru
        <p></p>show on his face, but from her perspective, it probably seemed like he had suddenly
        <p></p>gotten angry at her.
        <p></p>He couldn't possibly explain the reason for his icy demeanor, so there was nothing to
        <p></p>do but keep his mouth shut and evade the issue.
        <p></p>Everyone knew that Amane was a gloomy introvert, downright unsociable really, so
        <p></p>nothing about this behavior should have aroused anyone's suspicions.
        <p></p>"…Are you feeling unwell, Amane?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"No, I'm not sick, I'm just tired," he replied. "Really, I'm trying my best to not fall asleep.
        <p></p>We've got tests coming up, so I can't very well sleep through class now."
        <p></p>"Geez! So serious." Chitose giggled.
        <p></p>"You should try to be more serious, too," he chided. "Our school's exams are hard, so
        <p></p>stop playing around and try studying for a change."
        <p></p>"Speaking of exams, I think it would be more fun, and more effective, if we did our
        <p></p>studying all together, don't you?" Chitose asked.
        <p></p>"Oh? Then perhaps Shiina ought to tutor you."
        <p></p>"I guess that would work, but…"
        <p></p>Chitose was staring hard at Amane, but he refused to make eye contact with her. He
        <p></p>pulled the materials for the next class out of his desk and directed his attention toward
        <p></p>arranging them.
        <p></p>If he participated any longer in the conversation, he would inevitably have to talk to
        <p></p>Mahiru. He sighed softly and leafed through a textbook as if the rest of the discussion
        <p></p>was no concern of his.
        <p></p>Amane left school promptly after classes ended, did the evening's shopping, and
        <p></p>returned home.
        <p></p>As usual, Mahiru was already in his apartment, preparing food, but she was obviously
        <p></p>feeling dejected.
        <p></p>She seemed to be able to sense that something was different about his mood and kept
        <p></p>glancing over at him and frowning. Often at home, they would act a little more familiar,
        <p></p>but that evening, she carefully maintained a sense of distance that was not all that
        <p></p>different from how she behaved at school.
        <p></p>Amane still felt terribly awkward, and he tried to push thoughts of Mahiru out of his
        <p></p>mind as best he could. It was easy to understand how she might interpret that as him
        <p></p>ignoring her.
        <p></p>"Are you mad at me…?" Mahiru asked nervously, after they had finished eating dinner
        <p></p>without even looking at each other once.
        <p></p>Realizing his error, Amane looked up at her.
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes flickered with anxiety.
        <p></p>"I'm not mad," he replied.
        <p></p>"People only answer that way when they're mad. You've been acting strange all day,
        <p></p>and you're being terse with me… Did I do something to upset you without realizing
        <p></p>it…?"
        <p></p>Even though Amane had clearly been the one avoiding her, Mahiru sounded apologetic,
        <p></p>which made him realize that he had only been thinking about his own personal
        <p></p>discomfort.
        <p></p>Flustered, Amane took Mahiru's hands in his and peered into her eyes, which were
        <p></p>more tearful than usual.
        <p></p>"N-no, that's not it. You didn't do anything, Mahiru. I'm sorry for hurting your feelings."
        <p></p>"So then, why… why are you acting so cold?"
        <p></p>"W-well, um, there are a number of reasons, I guess you could say…"
        <p></p>Amane found himself faltering when it came time to offer any.
        <p></p>He obviously knew he couldn't be too honest—a girl like Mahiru would definitely be
        <p></p>put off by something like that. He didn't want to put her in an awkward position or
        <p></p>make her uncomfortable around him later.
        <p></p>"I've been wondering if maybe you'd gotten tired of me or something…"
        <p></p>"Absolutely not!" Amane insisted. "I-I've just got some personal stuff going on…
        <p></p>There's just a lot on my mind."
        <p></p>"…And you're not going to tell me about it?"
        <p></p>Mahiru frowned dejectedly and looked at the floor. Amane could only groan.
        <p></p>How can I possibly explain?
        <p></p>He hated lying to her, so he decided the best course of action was to only tell her the
        <p></p>mildest version of the truth. Though he wasn't sure exactly how to round off the rough
        <p></p>edges or sound vague in this particular case.
        <p></p>If he messed up, she wouldn't understand, and she might even be repulsed instead.
        <p></p>"It—it's no big deal, really, okay?"
        <p></p>"…Even though it's something bad enough to make you ignore me?"
        <p></p>"No, the thing is, I mean, how do I put this? I'm doing it to exercise self-control, or, like,
        <p></p>to settle my mind down."
        <p></p>"You don't feel calm when I'm around?"
        <p></p>"That's not what I mean, it's just, it's d-difficult."
        <p></p>"So it's hard to spend time with me?"
        <p></p>"That's not what I said! Geez, how can I say this…?"
        <p></p>If she was a boy, it would have been easy. Amane wasn't sure he could put it in a way
        <p></p>that a girl would understand, no matter what he said to her. Yet he had to tell her
        <p></p>something, or she would misunderstand again.
        <p></p>Mahiru obviously wanted to know why he was avoiding her if she hadn't done
        <p></p>anything wrong, but all Amane could manage to tell her was that it was hard to explain.
        <p></p>For the sake of his likely nonexistent pride, he needed to put it as delicately as possible.
        <p></p>"…So you said that you want me to touch you more," he explained tentatively. "And
        <p></p>because of that, how do I say this, I… had a, uh, a dream."
        <p></p>"A… dream?"
        <p></p>"…A dream where you were pleading with me, very sweetly, for certain things…"
        <p></p>Somehow, that was the best answer Amane could come up with.
        <p></p>Mahiru made a face like she didn't understand what he was talking about. She blinked
        <p></p>her wide eyes dramatically.
        <p></p>"R-really, I hate that I dreamed something like that," Amane continued. "I try to avoid
        <p></p>seeing you that way, and I would never be pushy about touching you. But this time I
        <p></p>just… it's because yesterday, you… you were saying such cute things. And then, about
        <p></p>me avoiding you awkwardly… it wasn't because I was mad at you or anything, it was
        <p></p>because I was disgusted with myself…"
        <p></p>"…How exactly was I pleading with you, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Are you trying to embarrass me?!" he balked. Mahiru hadn't recoiled from him, which
        <p></p>was good, but her curiosity seemed somehow even more dangerous, and he could feel
        <p></p>his face twitching.
        <p></p>Dreams supposedly reflected desires, so if he told her what he had dreamed, she
        <p></p>would then know he thought of her and looked at her in that way, even if it was not on
        <p></p>purpose.
        <p></p>"Embarrass you…? No, I was just thinking I must have been really aggressive, if it was
        <p></p>enough to make you feel uncomfortable. So I wanted to know, for reference."
        <p></p>"You don't need to know. What sort of reference would that be useful for anyway?"
        <p></p>"…Like for when I'm trying to make your heart race."
        <p></p>"Would you please stop trying to give me a heart attack?"
        <p></p>Amane didn't understand why Mahiru seemed to enjoy tormenting him. She had
        <p></p>already found plenty of questionable ways to surprise him, so he didn't want to give
        <p></p>her any more ideas.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked relieved, like she'd completely forgotten about any concern or anxiety
        <p></p>that had been previously troubling her. Her cheeks had reddened faintly, probably
        <p></p>because Amane had let the word "cute" slip out of his mouth.
        <p></p>"It's a relief to hear that I'm not being shunned—I'm glad we cleared that up."
        <p></p>For some reason, Mahiru's mouth curled upward in a good-humored smile. She stared
        <p></p>contently at Amane, who had his own lips tightly drawn in shame and embarrassment.
        <p></p>"Amane, you're kind of… well, among the boys I know, you're the most innocent."
        <p></p>"Oh, be quiet, I could say the same about you."
        <p></p>"I'm sure you would have been more surprised if you'd learned that I was used to being
        <p></p>in the company of males quite often… Really, though, I've never spent much time
        <p></p>around boys before. You're the only one I'm this close with, Amane."
        <p></p>"…A-and I hardly ever associate with girls, so…"
        <p></p>Amane was aware that he sounded pathetic, but he couldn't bring himself to lie.
        <p></p>Anyway, if he had tried to pass himself off as someone who spent a lot of time with
        <p></p>girls, Mahiru probably would have laughed at him.
        <p></p>"Well, you seem pretty good at handling girls, all things considered," she remarked.
        <p></p>"You must be joking," Amane scoffed. "I can't handle anything. I'm just… I always try to
        <p></p>do what's right, and be decent, like my parents always said. And if I do anything bad, I
        <p></p>try to balance it out by doing something to make you happy, that's all. I'm happy when
        <p></p>you're happy… surely there's nothing wrong with that?"
        <p></p>"Nothing at all." Mahiru nodded. "You're sly that way, Amane."
        <p></p>"What's that supposed to mean?"
        <p></p>"Everything about you is sly."
        <p></p>"Are you trying to put me down…?"
        <p></p>"No, it's the opposite. I'm trying my best to encourage you, to get you to have more
        <p></p>self-confidence."
        <p></p>"…I don't understand what you're getting at, though."
        <p></p>"That's fine, you don't have to understand right now."
        <p></p>This wasn't the first time they'd had this exchange, and Amane still didn't know what
        <p></p>about him was supposed to be devious.
        <p></p>But Amane didn't think he needed to try too hard to find the answer.
        <p></p>Mahiru had been so concerned and dejected by Amane's behavior. Now, though, she
        <p></p>was smiling cheerfully without the least bit of worry.
        <p></p>"Anyway, I got to hear something good today," she said.
        <p></p>"Something good?"
        <p></p>"You said that I'm the first person of the opposite sex you've ever been this close with."
        <p></p>Amane responded to Mahiru's outrageous statement with a sudden coughing fit.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked up at him curiously. It didn't seem like she had intended to provoke a
        <p></p>reaction from him. She had probably just said what was on her mind. That was what
        <p></p>made it so shocking for Amane.
        <p></p>"Th-that's misleading… Well, it's not misleading, but you make it sound weird! And it's
        <p></p>none of your business anyway!" he stammered.
        <p></p>"Why are you getting so flustered? It's kind of nice, isn't it? Since I'm having all these
        <p></p>firsts, too. It means that we've both fumbled our way closer together, right?"
        <p></p>"…Well, that's true, but…"
        <p></p>Thinking about how things had been up to this point, her observation did seem
        <p></p>reasonable, but it felt overwhelmingly embarrassing to hear her say it so purely,
        <p></p>without any other intentions. The more he tried not to overthink it, the more it
        <p></p>weighed on him.
        <p></p>"…Amane?"
        <p></p>"It's nothing, so don't look at me, please."
        <p></p>He didn't want her to see the shame that was practically oozing off of him again, and
        <p></p>he turned his back to her without rising from the sofa.
        <p></p>He didn't want to be seen, and he didn't want to look at her, either.
        <p></p>"Why are you speaking so stiffly?"
        <p></p>"Don't worry about it."
        <p></p>"…All right, I won't look."
        <p></p>Instead, Mahiru turned and sat with her back to his, so that she was able to lean
        <p></p>against him. He turned his head to look at her and got a jab in the ribs.
        <p></p>He couldn't see her face, but he was certain she was grinning mischievously.
        <p></p>"If we sit like this, I'm 'not looking,' right?"
        <p></p>"…I guess not."
        <p></p>"Well, you'll just have to deal with it, since I had to deal with you avoiding me all day."
        <p></p>When she put it that way, Amane could tell that there was no way he was going to pull
        <p></p>himself out of the hole he'd dug, and he wasn't even going to bother trying.
        <p></p>Feeling a strange sort of tranquility, though the warmth gradually spreading through
        <p></p>his back was making his chest throb, Amane let his chin rest on his knees.
        <p></p>"…Please don't tell people about your first time or whatever anymore," he mumbled. "I
        <p></p>really don't know how to endure it."
        <p></p>He felt Mahiru shiver, as if she had only just then remembered the issue. Then,
        <p></p>apparently, she turned around, because he felt her grab the back of his shirt.
        <p></p>"Th-that's not what I meant to say at all, okay?! Well, it is, but I didn't say it with that
        <p></p>in mind!"
        <p></p>"I—I understand, so just don't say any more."
        <p></p>Knowing that Mahiru had never been so close to anyone made it even more
        <p></p>embarrassing when she talked about things like that.
        <p></p>It didn't take much thought to realize that the two of them had experienced a lot of
        <p></p>firsts together.
        <p></p>At least in Amane's case, Mahiru was the first girl he had held hands with, except for
        <p></p>his mother when he was a young child. Mahiru was also the only one he had ever
        <p></p>embraced. It was very likely the same for her.
        <p></p>To get to be part of these new experiences with the girl he liked, to be the first step for
        <p></p>her, was delightful, embarrassing, and an honor.
        <p></p>Amane found himself wishing that he could be her first and last love as well.
        <p></p>He smiled quietly to himself as Mahiru put her forehead against his back and rubbed
        <p></p>against him out of embarrassment. How nice it would be to stay by her side in the
        <p></p>future, he thought.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 43: Studying with the Angel 
        <p></p>Things between Amane and Mahiru seemed to be back to normal the following day,
        <p></p>and Chitose and Itsuki appeared relieved—apparently, they had been quite concerned.
        <p></p>Amane's behavior had only changed slightly, but it must have been enough for them
        <p></p>to notice.
        <p></p>The events of the previous day weighed heavily on Amane's mind, but he wasn't acting
        <p></p>as awkwardly with Mahiru anymore. There were still some things that were bothering
        <p></p>him, but as long as they were in school, he couldn't say a word about them.
        <p></p>Mahiru was giving everyone her usual angelic smile. She was currently surrounded by
        <p></p>female classmates pestering her to teach them how to study.
        <p></p>Midterms were starting next week, and the girls must have wanted Mahiru, the top
        <p></p>genius in the grade, to be their tutor. There was a touch of bewilderment mixed into
        <p></p>Mahiru's gentle smile.
        <p></p>"I don't mind helping you all prepare for the tests, but I might not have enough room
        <p></p>to host everyone…"
        <p></p>Thinking this wasn't going to be good, Amane pricked up his ears to listen in. It seemed
        <p></p>that the girls who wanted to study with Mahiru hoped they could do it at her place.
        <p></p>They were probably curious to see what her apartment was like.
        <p></p>That would be a problem, since Mahiru is such a private person.
        <p></p>Although they weren't strangers, they weren't exactly friends, either, not like Chitose
        <p></p>was. It would be very difficult for Mahiru to let them into her home.
        <p></p>From Amane's perspective, too, he didn't want them coming around where he lived if
        <p></p>it could be avoided, just in case they caught wind of anything. He could just imagine
        <p></p>the girls prying into every detail, while he endured resentment from the boys.
        <p></p>"Ah, no fair, no fair! I want help, too!"
        <p></p>"Me toooo!"
        <p></p>Then, other girls who had overheard the conversation put their hands up as well, and
        <p></p>Mahiru was understandably wearing a troubled expression. Clearly there was no way
        <p></p>so many people could fit in her apartment.
        <p></p>To make matters worse, the boys were looking over enviously.
        <p></p>"…Um, we could study together for an hour or two in the classroom after school today,"
        <p></p>Mahiru suggested, as a compromise. Their classroom had plenty of space. Despite that,
        <p></p>there didn't seem to be an end to the chorus of voices asking to join. Club activities
        <p></p>were paused during exams, so it was probably much easier for people to gather than
        <p></p>usual.
        <p></p>As he listened to the loud shouts of his classmates from across the room, Amane
        <p></p>couldn't help but feel bad for Mahiru.
        <p></p>With a strangely cheerful grin, Itsuki prodded Amane. "You're not going to take part?"
        <p></p>"Would there be any point?" he replied. "I already know everything that's going to be
        <p></p>on the tests, and even if I didn't, with so many people, there won't be much time for
        <p></p>everyone's questions anyway. Trust me, I'm better off studying on my own."
        <p></p>"Well, I certainly must commend your discipline, Amane, but I think we'd better join
        <p></p>this study session anyway. It's a matter of motivation."
        <p></p>"I've always liked studying, so my motivation has always been—"
        <p></p>"Not yours, hers."
        <p></p>Amane looked over at Mahiru, making plans for a study session with more than half
        <p></p>the class. It was obvious that she was going to have a hard time with so many people.
        <p></p>She would probably feel better with a friend in the room. Finally, it began to dawn on
        <p></p>Amane that he ought to attend, whether or not he felt the need to.
        <p></p>"…Even though there's not really anything for her to teach me?" he asked.
        <p></p>"It'll be fine," Itsuki insisted. "Look, you can tutor me. See, Chitose is going to join in,
        <p></p>so I was gonna be stuck waiting for her anyway. There's no harm in studying a little
        <p></p>while I'm there, eh?"
        <p></p>"Teaching other people is not my strong point…"
        <p></p>"Well, sure, the way you talk is can be a bit unfriendly, and you're not exactly the type
        <p></p>to patiently explain things… but you wouldn't just let me fail, right?"
        <p></p>Amane faltered in the face of Itsuki's confident voice and gaze.
        <p></p>"I'm countin' on you, pal!" Itsuki cackled and clapped Amane on the shoulder.
        <p></p>Amane gave up on turning him down and just nodded.
        <p></p>Usually, after class ended, a handful of students might hang around for a while. But
        <p></p>that day, there was a bustle of activity that was truly rare to see.
        <p></p>The desks, which had been neatly arranged during cleaning time, were now pushed
        <p></p>together to form several clusters, and students assembled themselves with their
        <p></p>groups of friends. Even the boys from class joined, which meant there were six times
        <p></p>as many people as there should have been.
        <p></p>Amane sat facing Itsuki in the seat farthest away from Mahiru.
        <p></p>"…I can't be very much help like this, can I?" he whispered.
        <p></p>"I'm ready to learn, teacher!" Itsuki replied.
        <p></p>"…Wouldn't we be better off at home?"
        <p></p>"I'm just here to study while I wait for Chi. Besides, she's going to be late getting home,
        <p></p>and you wouldn't want to leave her on her own, right?"
        <p></p>Amane narrowed his eyes at Itsuki, who was giving him a pointed look, but Itsuki just
        <p></p>laughed.
        <p></p>Mahiru usually tried to get home before dark if she could, but because of the study
        <p></p>session, she was sure to be late. Mahiru was a very cautious person and even carried
        <p></p>a personal safety alarm around with her, but Itsuki was right, it probably wouldn't be
        <p></p>good to let her go back alone in the dark.
        <p></p>On the other hand, Amane couldn't possibly walk her home with all their classmates
        <p></p>watching, so he would have to keep his distance and stealthily watch over her as they
        <p></p>walked.
        <p></p>"You don't seem to see this for the opportunity it is, Amane…"
        <p></p>"What, you want me to turn into some sort of predator now? That's not me, and
        <p></p>personally, I have a problem with the idea of taking advantage of someone's
        <p></p>carelessness to make a move."
        <p></p>"That attitude of yours must be how you've gained her trust. Well, you guys will be
        <p></p>heading back to the same place, so I guess there's no point trying anything on the way
        <p></p>anyhow. It's not like you won't have plenty of chances to make your move."
        <p></p>"It's not like I would anyway! If I made her hate me, or made her cry, I'd die."
        <p></p>Mahiru left him plenty of openings, since she let him inside her defenses. Even so,
        <p></p>Amane had never considered seizing one of those chances to try anything. Rather, he
        <p></p>had always warned her about letting her guard down.
        <p></p>If he tried anything with Mahiru when she was being careless because of her trust in
        <p></p>him, their happy relationship could very well disappear. Amane didn't want to lose her
        <p></p>trust, or his dignity.
        <p></p>Itsuki knew what his friend was like. He shrugged in a slightly exasperated manner,
        <p></p>but Amane paid him no attention and opened his textbook to the material that would
        <p></p>be covered on the exams.
        <p></p>"Look, I'm all good here, so why don't you tell me where we should start? I don't have
        <p></p>trouble with anything, which means it's up to you to point out the sections you don't
        <p></p>understand if you want to get anything done." Amane drummed his fingers on the
        <p></p>pages and pressed his friend for an answer.
        <p></p>"Dodging the issue, huh?" Itsuki grinned and opened his own book.
        <p></p>Itsuki wasn't stupid or anything—in fact, he was quite capable. He had a good
        <p></p>understanding of his own abilities and was the type who could produce good results
        <p></p>with minimal effort. He just found studying a bore and goofed off a lot to annoy his
        <p></p>parents. Fundamentally, he had an earnest disposition.
        <p></p>Amane had heard that in middle school, Itsuki had been an honors student, but when
        <p></p>he'd started hanging out with Chitose, it apparently caused some trouble at home and
        <p></p>kicked off his rebellious phase.
        <p></p>"I seriously do not understand English sentences," Itsuki complained.
        <p></p>"Maybe you should start by memorizing the vocabulary… For now, you can begin with
        <p></p>the words and sentences that are sure to show up on the test. You slept through the
        <p></p>class when the teacher went over the exam material, but he did tell us what to expect."
        <p></p>Itsuki rarely skipped class, but he often fell asleep. Amane poked him in the forehead
        <p></p>and continued.
        <p></p>"For the time being, I'll make another copy of my notes for you. There's a limit to how
        <p></p>much you can cram for the long reading comprehension section. Basically, at this
        <p></p>point, it's probably impossible to learn it all. Don't worry about doing it perfectly, but
        <p></p>just try not to miss the vocabulary and multiple-choice questions. As long as you know
        <p></p>at least a little bit, on most multiple-choice questions you can narrow it down to two
        <p></p>answers, so we should work on getting you to where you can reliably pick the correct
        <p></p>one out of the two. Let's place the most emphasis on scoring attainable points. You're
        <p></p>just barely passing English, right?"
        <p></p>"Whew, you're a lifesaver, man! I'll thank you later by giving you a push in the right
        <p></p>direction."
        <p></p>"I do not need you to do that. It's none of your concern."
        <p></p>Amane wanted to progress slowly in his relationship with Mahiru, in his own way, so
        <p></p>if Itsuki pushed him too hard, he was liable to resist out of spite.
        <p></p>Itsuki met his friend's refusal with a frustrated look, but Amane wasn't inclined to
        <p></p>change his opinion.
        <p></p>Before he could worry about progressing in their relationship, Amane wanted to
        <p></p>improve himself enough that he would feel confident about being with Mahiru. To do
        <p></p>that, he needed to prioritize his studies.
        <p></p>Itsuki seemed like he was about to say something else, but Amane ignored him, and
        <p></p>once he had counted the number of pages in the notebook he was going to copy, he
        <p></p>slammed it shut. "Good grief," Amane said as he picked up his mechanical pencil.
        <p></p>Itsuki assumed a studying posture, and with quiet relief, Amane glanced over in
        <p></p>Mahiru's direction.
        <p></p>Just like always, she was smiling as she kindly explained the material to her
        <p></p>classmates. As he watched her circulate busily through the room, smiling at everyone
        <p></p>equally, Amane thought to himself that being the campus angel must be a tough role
        <p></p>to play.
        <p></p>"Why can't I get the answer here?"
        <p></p>"Use the formula."
        <p></p>"I'm using it, but I'm not getting the answer!"
        <p></p>Chitose's group was studying together while chatting happily, and their cluster of
        <p></p>desks was especially lively. However, a different group of boys seemed to be in trouble.
        <p></p>Even Mahiru wasn't able to follow up with every single person, and depending on each
        <p></p>individual's ability to comprehend the material, it could take time to teach them. On
        <p></p>top of that, Mahiru kept getting called over by the rowdiest students, so even though
        <p></p>she was trying to help those classmates who weren't incessantly demanding her
        <p></p>attention, she couldn't avoid getting pulled this way and that.
        <p></p>Amane hesitated for a moment over what to do, then stood up from his seat.
        <p></p>He walked over to the classmates who were frowning in frustration and looked over
        <p></p>their shoulders to check the part in the text and the equation that was tripping them
        <p></p>up. Then he slowly pointed to the relevant section in the textbook.
        <p></p>His classmates looked up at him, seemingly surprised by his sudden appearance, but
        <p></p>Amane turned a blind eye to their stares and walked them through the problem.
        <p></p>In this group's case, they were simply using the wrong formula to solve the question,
        <p></p>so it was easy to sort things out once Amane pointed out the issue that was giving
        <p></p>them trouble.
        <p></p>Amane felt relieved that they had accepted his help despite his abrupt intrusion. He
        <p></p>made eye contact with the boy sitting across from him, who was blinking repeatedly.
        <p></p>"I'm not Shiina, but it looks like she has her hands full. Sorry for butting in."
        <p></p>"…No, I'm grateful for the help," the boy said. "But I didn't expect you to come over and
        <p></p>say something, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>"Well, you looked like you were having trouble," Amane responded.
        <p></p>He found it almost darkly comical just how cold and unfriendly everyone always
        <p></p>assumed he was, but he knew it was true that he could be unsociable and downright
        <p></p>gloomy, so he couldn't deny it.
        <p></p>Amane was turning to leave with an awkward smile when the classmate across from
        <p></p>him asked, "So what about this one?" and showed Amane another problem he couldn't
        <p></p>work out.
        <p></p>Since he was there already, Amane demonstrated how to solve that question, too.
        <p></p>The other boys all looked at each other, then for some reason, over at Itsuki.
        <p></p>"Hey, Itsuki! Can we borrow Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"Well, he's mine, but I guess there's no helping it." Itsuki grinned.
        <p></p>"Since when did I become yours?"
        <p></p>Amane feigned offense at Itsuki's comment. He noticed that his friend was cheerfully
        <p></p>pushing their two desks over to the boys in the study group. Amane was shocked at
        <p></p>how quickly Itsuki joined them.
        <p></p>He didn't really mind, but he wished Itsuki had asked his permission first.
        <p></p>Amane sighed and sat back down in his own seat, which had been integrated into the
        <p></p>new group. As he did, he kicked Itsuki lightly below the desks.
        <p></p>"Just so you know, I'm not that good at teaching," he stated.
        <p></p>"Well, thanks even so," one of the boys said. "Miss Angel looks busy over there."
        <p></p>"We all joined in at the last minute," another added, "so Shiina can't make it around to
        <p></p>everyone on her own."
        <p></p>They were staring longingly at the group that Mahiru was tutoring, but it wasn't
        <p></p>exactly envy in their eyes. They simply looked disappointed.
        <p></p>"We decided to come because it sounded fun, figuring we'd be lucky to receive any
        <p></p>help, so getting help from Fujimiya is fine with us."
        <p></p>"Well, ideally the angel, 'cause she's cute and I'd be happier, but…"
        <p></p>"Well, don't expect me to be cute," Amane said, smiling wryly. "So show me the part
        <p></p>you don't understand…?"
        <p></p>Amane prided himself on not having an ounce of cuteness to him. As a fellow guy,
        <p></p>though, he understood what the others were trying to say. Who wouldn't prefer to be
        <p></p>tutored by a friendly and intelligent girl like Mahiru, rather than an unsociable guy
        <p></p>like him? Anybody would have been happier with her.
        <p></p>Amane shrugged, then asked them where they needed help and explained the material
        <p></p>to them.
        <p></p>Fortunately, Amane was able to explain all the problems, and since the other students
        <p></p>had asked for his help, they tackled the material earnestly and came to understand it
        <p></p>fairly quickly.
        <p></p>Even Itsuki joined in with the other four students, asking questions and solving
        <p></p>example problems. It was hard enough for Amane to handle four additional people, so
        <p></p>things must have been even more difficult for Mahiru.
        <p></p>With that thought, Amane looked over in her direction and saw her answering
        <p></p>questions for the neighboring group.
        <p></p>However, none of the questions were related to the exam material.
        <p></p>"…Do I have a type?"
        <p></p>Mahiru pondered the question curiously as the girls who had asked looked at her with
        <p></p>keen interest.
        <p></p>The girls seemed to have changed tactics on Mahiru, who had been stubbornly
        <p></p>refusing to reveal anything about the boy she had mentioned. Now they were trying
        <p></p>to gather information indirectly on what kind of person he might be. Mahiru had never
        <p></p>stated outright whether the mystery boy was her boyfriend or someone she liked, but
        <p></p>even so, as one might expect, they all seemed to assume that she was interested in
        <p></p>him.
        <p></p>The girls hadn't asked their question very loudly, but the surrounding groups still
        <p></p>overheard it, and all the students in the classroom strained their ears for the answer,
        <p></p>even as they continued working on their own practice problems.
        <p></p>"Let me think…," Mahiru said. "In terms of absolute requirements, I suppose he would
        <p></p>have to be a kind and honest person. I don't like dishonest people at all."
        <p></p>"And what about appearance?"
        <p></p>"I think what's inside is more important, so I'm not too particular about looks," Mahiru
        <p></p>replied. "…But someone who keeps themselves tidy would be good."
        <p></p>The answer that she gave, with a tender smile and look in her eye, was more about the
        <p></p>kind of person she preferred than the kind of boy she liked, giving the impression that
        <p></p>she was evading the question.
        <p></p>The girls who had asked the question must have also felt that she was being vague,
        <p></p>and they stared at Mahiru with a hint of disappointment on their faces. Mahiru smiled
        <p></p>back at them as always, but this time, it was tinged with bitterness.
        <p></p>"When I think about what else might be important, I guess… someone whose values
        <p></p>match mine?"
        <p></p>"Values? Not hobbies and stuff?"
        <p></p>"Yes, values." Mahiru nodded. "I doubt they will ever match up perfectly, so I'm not
        <p></p>expecting that, but I think it's important that we respect each other's values, even if
        <p></p>they don't align. Someone who would never force their point of view, or try to change
        <p></p>their partner… Yes, someone who appreciates their partner's ideas would be good. It
        <p></p>would probably be best if it was someone who saw things the same way, but I like
        <p></p>people who stand by their partner and accept their beliefs, even if they can't."
        <p></p>Mahiru brought her speech to a finish with a gentle smile, and her gaze darted over to
        <p></p>Amane for just a second.
        <p></p>He reflexively averted his eyes, and Mahiru returned her focus to the group of girls
        <p></p>with no change in her expression.
        <p></p>Amane knew that the people around him would start to notice if he stared at Mahiru
        <p></p>any longer, so he lowered his gaze to the notebook in his hands. But then he heard a
        <p></p>quiet chuckle from beside him, from someone who had been watching his behavior.
        <p></p>"And that's that, ladies and gentlemen."
        <p></p>Itsuki had observed while everyone else had abruptly stopped working. The boys
        <p></p>Itsuki and Amane were studying with seemed to realize what was going on, and they
        <p></p>quickly went back to their own notebooks in an attempt to feign ignorance.
        <p></p>Amane was turning pages and applying sticky notes as if nothing had happened, as he
        <p></p>mulled over the idea of matching values.
        <p></p>Mahiru was the type of person who could never date anyone casually, and if she was
        <p></p>with someone for a long time, she would probably be thinking about settling down
        <p></p>with them. That meant it was important that whoever she chose didn't make things
        <p></p>difficult for her.
        <p></p>"The angel has a really mature way of thinking about things, huh?" one of the other
        <p></p>boys commented.
        <p></p>"Well, I think Shiina's got a point," Amane mumbled. When everyone turned to look at
        <p></p>him, he gave a strained smile. "It would be hard to spend time with somebody if their
        <p></p>values didn't align with yours, and everyone wants to have someone by their side who
        <p></p>accepts them, right? Even if you tried to get along with someone who held different
        <p></p>values, eventually it would put too much stress on the relationship, and you'd break
        <p></p>up. I think that logically, taking that into account from the start is better."
        <p></p>Things would be even worse if your partner was the kind of person who couldn't tolerate
        <p></p>differing opinions. The resulting stress would obviously hurt the relationship. So when it
        <p></p>comes to dating someone with incompatible beliefs, it'd be best not to even bother.
        <p></p>"You've got a strict way of thinking about it… I can't even imagine what your type is,
        <p></p>Fujimiya."
        <p></p>Amane shrugged. "Well, like everyone else, I'd prefer someone kind."
        <p></p>"That's such a vague answer! There's no other criteria?"
        <p></p>"I don't know what to say," he replied. "…Assuming that I get along with her, I think I'd
        <p></p>like a girl who's gentle and sensible."
        <p></p>"By that standard, you would like most girls."
        <p></p>"Oh, shut up. Do you have some sort of problem with that?"
        <p></p>"It's not that I have a problem, but it just feels like a very common opinion."
        <p></p>"…All right, how about I say that whatever girl I fall for will be my preferred type?
        <p></p>Whoever I like is my type at that moment."
        <p></p>Amane was afraid that if he gave too many specifics, he would end up revealing who
        <p></p>he liked, so he kept his answers as vague as possible to arousing any suspicion. From
        <p></p>behind him, he heard someone let out a small giggle.
        <p></p>"What an unexpectedly sweet thing for you to say."
        <p></p>His body stiffened at the sound of a familiar voice.
        <p></p>Amane wanted to ask her why she was over here and what exactly she had heard, but
        <p></p>Mahiru coming over to his group wasn't particularly strange, nor was it weird that she
        <p></p>would overhear what he said once she got close, so he swallowed his protests.
        <p></p>Keeping a stony expression so as not to betray his feelings, Amane didn't even look in
        <p></p>Mahiru's direction as he responded, "Sorry."
        <p></p>Amane knew that it didn't give a very good impression to be so blunt with the class
        <p></p>angel, but since he already had a reputation for being unsociable, nobody acted
        <p></p>especially surprised.
        <p></p>"Shiina…"
        <p></p>"I'm sorry for showing up so late. I haven't been able to come over here much, but…
        <p></p>are there any parts that you're having trouble understanding?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had finally finished up on the other side of the room and made her way over
        <p></p>to check on Amane's group. She sounded quite apologetic. Amane didn't know
        <p></p>whether she was standing next to him on purpose or not, but it wasn't good for his
        <p></p>heart.
        <p></p>After the boys all looked at each other, one of them spoke up, looking sheepish.
        <p></p>"Uh, actually, we got Fujimiya to tutor us. We should be the ones apologizing, for
        <p></p>joining your study session so suddenly."
        <p></p>"Oh, no, it's all right. It's my fault, really, for agreeing to tutor so many people without
        <p></p>thinking about how much I can handle. I just couldn't keep up with everyone. But I'm
        <p></p>relieved to hear that you got help from Fujimiya." She gave him a friendly smile and
        <p></p>added, "Studying is one of Fujimiya's strong points."
        <p></p>Amane felt extremely uncomfortable, but he didn't show his discomfort. "I am honored
        <p></p>by the compliment," he replied stoically.
        <p></p>Immediately after he said it, he looked up apologetically at Mahiru, worried that his
        <p></p>comment might have sounded sarcastic, but Mahiru met his eyes with a smile and an
        <p></p>affectionate look, as if to say that she understood everything.
        <p></p>"Fujimiya is very helpful and good at teaching, you know," Mahiru insisted.
        <p></p>"I… uh… I wouldn't really say that…," Amane stammered.
        <p></p>"Oh, and what would you call this? Plus, it's easy to see the way you support Chitose
        <p></p>and Akazawa, too. You act cold, but you're always watching out for them, right? You
        <p></p>extend your hand as soon as you see someone's in trouble."
        <p></p>Amane scowled when she said that it was "easy to see" him doing that, with such a
        <p></p>gentle expression on her face.
        <p></p>Mahiru did sometimes compliment Amane, but he never expected her to say
        <p></p>something like that or praise him in a place like this. His eyes began to dart nervously
        <p></p>around the room.
        <p></p>"He's blushing, he's blushing!" Itsuki jeered.
        <p></p>"Shut up, Itsuki… It's totally normal to support your friends."
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled fondly at him. "I'm glad that it's become a normal thing for you."
        <p></p>Finally, Amane couldn't endure it any longer, and he turned away.
        <p></p>Under the desk, Itsuki kicked him lightly with the toe of his shoe, as if urging Amane
        <p></p>on toward something.
        <p></p>As the study session concluded, Amane rolled his shoulders gently to loosen up the
        <p></p>stiffness that had gradually accumulated there.
        <p></p>Mahiru was looking at him with her usual smile and a hint of deep affection—it was a
        <p></p>look only someone close to her would recognize. Itsuki had noticed and started
        <p></p>pestering Amane secretly under the desk again. The boys in their study group had also
        <p></p>gotten used to Amane's presence and chatted openly with him as well.
        <p></p>For better or worse, Amane was exhausted. It was a good thing to have made some
        <p></p>friendly acquaintances, but it was somewhat difficult to do anything at all with Mahiru
        <p></p>there.
        <p></p>The other boys were finished studying too and returned the copies of Amane's notes
        <p></p>with promises of candy and junk food to repay him for the help.
        <p></p>Some of their classmates had left partway through, either because they had other
        <p></p>things to do or because it was a more serious study session than they wanted, so
        <p></p>Amane was secretly admiring the ones who had stayed for their diligence.
        <p></p>"Sorry for making you wait. And after you helped me out, too."
        <p></p>Mahiru stayed to the very end, to clean and tidy the classroom and return the key to
        <p></p>the office. Other classmates had asked if she wanted to head home together, but as the
        <p></p>organizer, she had various tasks to finish up, so she'd given them each a firm refusal
        <p></p>and had been about to stay behind alone until Amane had stepped in. He told her that
        <p></p>they had all used the classroom together, and it would surely be dangerous to let
        <p></p>Mahiru head home on her own late at night, so he would stay with her.
        <p></p>He wished that Itsuki and Chitose had been there to stay behind as well, though. He
        <p></p>felt some minor frustration toward his friends, who had thoughtlessly ducked out
        <p></p>earlier, as he and Mahiru walked down the deserted hallways together.
        <p></p>Since club activities were temporarily on hold, and since the sun had already set, there
        <p></p>were probably only a few teachers, office staff, and students left in the building. It
        <p></p>wasn't good to be seen alone with Mahiru at school, but it was too late to change that.
        <p></p>"No, no, I'm the one who should be apologizing," Amane insisted. "I might have gotten
        <p></p>in your way instead."
        <p></p>"Not at all; you really helped me out," Mahiru replied. "There was no way I could go
        <p></p>around to everyone by myself. I never imagined so many people would show up… and
        <p></p>there were some people who joined at the last minute, so there were way more than I
        <p></p>expected."
        <p></p>"I feel like that's not a big surprise, for the angel."
        <p></p>"…Oh, come on."
        <p></p>She shot him a look as a reminder that she didn't want him to call her by that
        <p></p>nickname, which Amane let pass with feigned ignorance. It was his meager payback
        <p></p>for her publicly complimenting him.
        <p></p>"But it went well; everyone tackled the material seriously," she said.
        <p></p>"There was a lot of chitchat throughout the room, but everyone was more serious than
        <p></p>I expected. Even I was working hard to keep up."
        <p></p>"You always take your studies seriously, Fujimiya. You seem even more motivated for
        <p></p>this round of exams than you have before."
        <p></p>"…I guess. I've been thinking I should put some more effort into certain things."
        <p></p>Amane intended to do the best he could at studying and at exercise. At the moment,
        <p></p>there was hardly anyone around, and he had a good reason to be accompanying
        <p></p>Mahiru, so he stayed by her side. However, Amane wanted to become someone who
        <p></p>could be with her without needing a reason and not worry about people talking.
        <p></p>Mahiru, who he was sure had no idea of the deeper reasons behind Amane's efforts,
        <p></p>smiled at him and said, "How admirable." They had just arrived at the entry hall, and
        <p></p>she turned to look at their surroundings. "The sun's already gone down, hasn't it?"
        <p></p>"Sure has," Amane agreed.
        <p></p>He noticed her staring at him.
        <p></p>She wasn't wearing her usual angelic smile, but rather the more intimate and slightly
        <p></p>expectant one that she often showed him when they were alone together.
        <p></p>Amane hesitated, briefly unsure of what she wanted. Though from their previous
        <p></p>conversations, he managed to guess what she was thinking and put on a slight smile.
        <p></p>"…It's late, so I'll walk you home."
        <p></p>Evidently, he guessed correctly, because Mahiru's porcelain cheeks flushed slightly,
        <p></p>turning the color of roses, and her lips gently curled up.
        <p></p>"Thank you for being so thoughtful," she said. "It's very kind of you."
        <p></p>"Are you making fun of me? You basically just told me what to do…," he muttered
        <p></p>quietly.
        <p></p>"Heh-heh."
        <p></p>Apparently Mahiru had heard what he said, and she crinkled her eyes like she found
        <p></p>it funny. "You dummy," she teased, before changing her shoes and heading out the front
        <p></p>door. Since they were supposed to be walking together, Amane slowed down to match
        <p></p>Mahiru's pace and let out a deliberate sigh.
        <p></p>…I bet it's pretty obvious.
        <p></p>It was clear that he had stayed behind so late in order to wait for Mahiru so that she
        <p></p>wouldn't have to go home alone.
        <p></p>Only, it wasn't good for them to be alone together in public, so he had intended to walk
        <p></p>behind or ahead of her, not side by side. Except now that she had anticipated it and
        <p></p>manipulated him into escorting her, there was no way he could say no to her.
        <p></p>"…You're a girl, Miss Shiina, so you shouldn't go home too late, you know."
        <p></p>"How kind of you to say so. Usually, I get home safely, and today I have you with me,
        <p></p>Mr. Fujimiya, so I feel extra safe."
        <p></p>"…Indeed."
        <p></p>Illuminated by the dim, unreliable streetlights, Mahiru's smile looked brighter than
        <p></p>the bulbs themselves, and Amane averted his eyes to avoid being dazzled.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 44: Studying with Everyone 
        <p></p>"Good morning, Fujimiya!"
        <p></p>"Morning."
        <p></p>The boys who had been in Amane's study group the day before greeted him breezily
        <p></p>the following morning. Incidentally, Mahiru had been in high spirits the whole walk
        <p></p>home and the rest of the night after they got back to their apartments.
        <p></p>Amane returned his classmates' morning greetings with a slight wave and set his bag
        <p></p>down at his desk. Itsuki and Yuuta, who had both arrived before Amane, ambled over,
        <p></p>smiling. Itsuki seemed to have a touch of Chitose's wicked scheming about him, and
        <p></p>Amane didn't think it was his imagination.
        <p></p>Predictably, Itsuki's grin changed to a smug smirk. Amane almost clicked his tongue
        <p></p>in irritation.
        <p></p>"How'd yesterday go?" Itsuki asked.
        <p></p>"Nothing really to report. And definitely nothing to warrant that dumb grin."
        <p></p>"Oh right, you guys had that study session, didn't you?" Yuuta said. "I had something
        <p></p>else to do, so I couldn't make it. Did anything happen?"
        <p></p>Yuuta hadn't been there, so he didn't seem to know the reason behind Itsuki's smug
        <p></p>expression.
        <p></p>Amane didn't feel like going to the trouble of explaining, so he shrugged and made a
        <p></p>face at Itsuki that conveyed mostly annoyance and frustration. "No, not really. We just
        <p></p>had a normal, solid study session."
        <p></p>"Oh, come on…," Itsuki prodded. "Nothing to say about my brilliant setup?"
        <p></p>"It was none of your business anyway, that's for sure."
        <p></p>Amane had been planning to escort Mahiru home (really, since their destinations were
        <p></p>basically the same, it would be more accurate to say he was also going home)
        <p></p>regardless of whether Itsuki had left first or not. Amane probably wouldn't have felt
        <p></p>so awkward or been so worried about attracting attention, and it would have
        <p></p>obviously been more comfortable if Itsuki and Chitose had tagged along.
        <p></p>"I'm fine," Amane insisted. "I'm making steady progress at my own pace, and I don't
        <p></p>need any encouragement."
        <p></p>"I'm pushing you because I'm starting to get impatient, though…," Itsuki whined.
        <p></p>"Shut up. Or I won't let you copy my notes."
        <p></p>"Ah! This is where I must withdraw. I shall spare you this time."
        <p></p>"You're infuriating."
        <p></p>Itsuki was the one in trouble, now that exams were drawing near and there was no
        <p></p>more time left. Itsuki would probably do fine even without much studying, but he had
        <p></p>said himself that it would be impossible for him to pass any of his weak subjects
        <p></p>without at least some preparation.
        <p></p>When Amane took the copy of notes out of his file folder and handed them over, he
        <p></p>teased, "Victory is mine," but was doubtful whether Itsuki would study hard once he
        <p></p>got home.
        <p></p>Amane went to give copies of his notes to the boys who had greeted him earlier—they
        <p></p>had requested them the day before. As thanks, they gave him candy until his hands
        <p></p>were full.
        <p></p>"You're a very caring dude," Itsuki remarked as Amane returned to his desk carrying
        <p></p>heaps of snacks. Itsuki seemed like he was about to launch into a story about Mahiru's
        <p></p>praise for Amane the day before.
        <p></p>Amane could feel his face begin to twitch as he cut Itsuki off—"You didn't offer me
        <p></p>anything, so I just made your copy along with the others."
        <p></p>Yuuta had been watching with a smile as always, but suddenly he made a disappointed
        <p></p>face. "I should have participated yesterday. It sounds like it was pretty fun. I wanted to
        <p></p>study with everyone, too."
        <p></p>"Well, Itsuki had fun messing with me," Amane said, "but I didn't have any fun being
        <p></p>messed with."
        <p></p>"This again?"
        <p></p>"Now, now. Itsuki's teasing comes from a place of love," Yuuta jested. "Probably. I
        <p></p>think."
        <p></p>"Why must you all doubt me so?"
        <p></p>"He gets sullen sometimes when you tease him too much, and it makes me wonder
        <p></p>whether there's love behind the jokes or not. You've got to dial it back at times, you
        <p></p>know? Fujimiya will probably forgive you eventually, but you'd better figure out where
        <p></p>the line is before you cross it."
        <p></p>"Yeah, sure, no problem. I know exactly where the line is."
        <p></p>"This guy pisses me off," Amane muttered.
        <p></p>Itsuki had never teased Amane to the point of crossing any lines or making him truly
        <p></p>angry. Even if Amane pouted a little bit, he was never really offended, and Itsuki always
        <p></p>stopped when Amane clapped back in irritation, and he never complained when he
        <p></p>got a particularly pointed retort, either. He probably knew where the line was.
        <p></p>Itsuki's knack at dancing around that line was impressive and a singular point of
        <p></p>irritation in Amane's life.
        <p></p>"Well now, I suppose Itsuki has always been a little… irritating," Yuuta admitted.
        <p></p>"How can you be so casually cruel, Yuuta? Who knew you were such a harsh critic?"
        <p></p>"I've recently decided that I can stand to be a bit harsh with you sometimes."
        <p></p>"You monster! I protest!"
        <p></p>"Ah-ha-ha!"
        <p></p>Yuuta laughed it off as Itsuki faked a pose of indignation; it was obvious that he wasn't
        <p></p>actually upset. Amane felt satisfied to see Itsuki on the receiving end of the jokes for
        <p></p>once, on several levels.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't hate him, even at times like this, so he secretly had on a wry smile.
        <p></p>"So let's just set Itsuki aside for a moment…," Yuuta said.
        <p></p>"Don't leave me out!" he protested.
        <p></p>"We won't get anywhere with you jabbering on, Itsuki, so be quiet for a minute. Now,
        <p></p>Amane, I'd also like to study together, the three of us. Want to have a study session on
        <p></p>Saturday or Sunday?"
        <p></p>Itsuki obediently shut his mouth tight like a certain cartoon rabbit, and Yuuta turned
        <p></p>away from him to ask Amane again, "How about it?"
        <p></p>Amane didn't have anything in particular planned for the weekend, and he figured that
        <p></p>with Yuuta there, it would probably be a normal study session, so he was inclined to
        <p></p>agree, but then he hesitated.
        <p></p>Amane thought a study session sounded fine, but there was the question of where to
        <p></p>hold it.
        <p></p>"…So where would we do it?"
        <p></p>"Ah, my place is out," Itsuki responded. "My parents will be there, so I think it'll be
        <p></p>awkward, or there might be an unpleasant atmosphere." Itsuki's tone was casual, but
        <p></p>Amane could tell that his friend was upset about the poor relationship he had with his
        <p></p>parents.
        <p></p>"…My house would be fine, I guess, but my older sisters will probably get in our way a
        <p></p>little, so I don't think it's well-suited for studying," Yuuta said.
        <p></p>"You've got sisters?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, two of them. They're kind of loud, pushy people, so I think Fujimiya would
        <p></p>probably be uncomfortable."
        <p></p>Amane knew that Yuuta was probably not downplaying it or anything, that his sisters
        <p></p>really were those kinds of girls. If he had to guess, Amane got the feeling that they
        <p></p>were the type he couldn't handle, so he thought it best to avoid Yuuta's house if
        <p></p>possible.
        <p></p>That meant Amane's place would be the most convenient.
        <p></p>Itsuki had been to his apartment many times before, and Amane didn't have any
        <p></p>objections to the idea of Yuuta coming in. At the same time, Amane wasn't the only
        <p></p>person who spent time in that apartment.
        <p></p>Mahiru wasn't necessarily always in his apartment, but she was kind enough to come
        <p></p>over and cook, and they had been studying together a lot recently, so there was a high
        <p></p>probability that she would be there over the weekend.
        <p></p>Amane smiled vaguely, thinking that he'd better not bring guests over without getting
        <p></p>Mahiru's permission first.
        <p></p>"Do you think you could ask her about it?" Itsuki asked.
        <p></p>"Ah, sure, I can do that." Amane nodded. "We can't just barge in without warning."
        <p></p>"It is your little love nest, after all…"
        <p></p>"Seriously, shut your mouth."
        <p></p>Amane glared at Itsuki, wondering what he would do if they were overheard, but
        <p></p>Itsuki had kept his voice low enough, and none of their classmates seemed to be
        <p></p>looking their way.
        <p></p>Amane gave an exasperated sigh and cast his eyes downward, thinking of Mahiru, who
        <p></p>was not currently in the classroom.
        <p></p>"Hey, Mahiru? I'm going to have a study session at my place with Itsuki and Kadowaki
        <p></p>tomorrow morning. Is that all right?"
        <p></p>After dinner, as he was carrying the dishes over to the sink, Amane posed the question
        <p></p>to Mahiru, who was carrying the silverware.
        <p></p>Itsuki had said that Saturday was better for his schedule. Amane felt bad about asking
        <p></p>at the last minute.
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked dramatically once, then gave him an encouraging look.
        <p></p>"I don't mind. Should I make food for everyone?"
        <p></p>"Oh, I would feel bad asking you to do so much, but… but I'd be grateful if you could…
        <p></p>Is that all right?"
        <p></p>"It's just a matter of making a bit more. I don't mind," she answered casually.
        <p></p>Amane was certain that it would still take a lot of extra labor. She'd probably planned
        <p></p>on making lunch for herself anyway, but nevertheless, he wouldn't be able to thank
        <p></p>Mahiru enough for adjusting her plans to match up with his.
        <p></p>"Can I study with you, too?"
        <p></p>"If you want to, the guys said it was fine… Should we call Chitose, too? I don't know
        <p></p>whether she's free or not, or whether she's really going to study, but I feel a little
        <p></p>anxious about leaving her out."
        <p></p>Chitose wasn't very studious. It wasn't that she didn't know how to study, but Amane
        <p></p>certainly wouldn't call her an academic. Though she had participated in the previous
        <p></p>day's study session, apparently, she hadn't made much progress, and she had even
        <p></p>laughed about how she was going to fail the tests.
        <p></p>"You don't need to worry about that. I've already invited her."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"Well, she was saying that she'll get told off by her father if she doesn't get a good score,
        <p></p>for her anyway, on this round of tests, so just today, I made plans to study with her on
        <p></p>Saturday."
        <p></p>"Maybe joining us was Chitose's plan all along?"
        <p></p>Amane had a feeling that Itsuki had told Chitose about their study party, but he had no
        <p></p>definitive proof. He smiled wryly at the thought of his two meddling friends, convinced
        <p></p>that she had gotten her information through Itsuki.
        <p></p>Wishing they had just told him the plan from the start, he quickly rinsed the oily plates
        <p></p>in hot water and began washing the dishes. Mahiru giggled a little and started packing
        <p></p>the cooled leftovers away in Tupperware.
        <p></p>"Well, whether that was her original aim or not, it looks like it will be a very lively
        <p></p>study session, huh?" she remarked.
        <p></p>"Will that be all right for you? If it gets a bit loud?"
        <p></p>"I'll be fine," Mahiru insisted. "Besides, I've been studying every day, so I'm not that
        <p></p>anxious about the tests."
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't need to worry, because she worked hard every day, so Amane didn't
        <p></p>really think anything more of it.
        <p></p>Though he did wonder how the group was going to manage to study efficiently.
        <p></p>"Hey, Mahiru, after we're done, could I look at your notes?"
        <p></p>"Sure, I don't mind. But you take nice notes too, Amane. They're popular, I hear."
        <p></p>"My notes are, sure. I guess because they're fairly neat. But I'm curious about the notes
        <p></p>of the top-ranking student."
        <p></p>"Don't get your hopes up because they're not as good as you're expecting."
        <p></p>Mahiru giggled again and put the leftovers in the refrigerator.
        <p></p>They would become Amane's breakfast the next day, so as he did the washing up, in
        <p></p>his mind, he thanked Mahiru. He was able to eat her home cooking not only for dinner,
        <p></p>but even for breakfast, improving his daily life, knowing that he was eating healthily
        <p></p>every day.
        <p></p>"Amane, you're studying really hard for these exams, aren't you?"
        <p></p>"Well, I'd like to improve my confidence in a few areas, and I figure if I'm going to go
        <p></p>to the trouble of studying, I should really work hard at it. I'd like to score in the top
        <p></p>ten."
        <p></p>"Is that so…? All right, then how about I give you a little motivation, then?"
        <p></p>"Motivation?"
        <p></p>"If you do make it into the top ten, I'll do anything you ask."
        <p></p>"…Huh?"
        <p></p>Amane froze for a second and nearly dropped the plate he was holding into the sink.
        <p></p>He couldn't believe what he'd just heard.
        <p></p>Almost breaking one of Mahiru's favorite plates brought Amane back to his senses,
        <p></p>and he took a deep breath.
        <p></p>Then he glanced over beside him and saw Mahiru, wearing her usual placid smile,
        <p></p>snapping the lid onto one of the containers.
        <p></p>"I said before that I would do basically anything if you just asked, but I figure this time,
        <p></p>we can make it a real prize. I'll grant you any wish, even something you would never
        <p></p>normally ask, okay?"
        <p></p>"…Girls shouldn't say things like that."
        <p></p>"Oh, are you going to ask me to do something dangerous?"
        <p></p>Though she must have been entirely aware that Amane would never do any such thing,
        <p></p>Mahiru tilted her head teasingly as she asked, and Amane couldn't help but frown. She
        <p></p>seemed confident that there would be no great danger in anything that Amane might
        <p></p>request.
        <p></p>When Amane stared at Mahiru, she gave him a bemused smile and bounced over to
        <p></p>stand beside him. He couldn't tell whether it was his imagination, but a hopeful look
        <p></p>seemed to have flashed across her face.
        <p></p>"…Supposing I did ask for something dangerous, what would you do?"
        <p></p>"Well, that would depend on what it was, but I think… I would admire your chivalry
        <p></p>and probably grant your wish."
        <p></p>It sounded like Mahiru did mean to fulfill Amane's request. Of course, that was probably
        <p></p>because she was sure that he wouldn't force her to do anything unreasonable. Amane
        <p></p>felt somewhat conflicted.
        <p></p>He didn't want to force her to do anything she didn't want to, but hearing the girl he
        <p></p>liked tell him that she would do anything he wanted gave him all sorts of wild ideas—
        <p></p>none of which he could say out loud.
        <p></p>He took a quick look at Mahiru and saw her smiling as if to say she was ready for
        <p></p>anything. She looked so innocent. Amane felt skewered by his own wretchedness.
        <p></p>"…All right, I want you to let me lie in your lap, like you did before."
        <p></p>Amane just barely held it together. After some deliberation, he made up his mind and
        <p></p>asked for something that he knew Mahiru was likely to agree to, and that he would in
        <p></p>general never request.
        <p></p>He wanted to experience that pleasant feeling one more time. It didn't seem like an
        <p></p>outrageous request, and Amane figured he could keep ahold of himself.
        <p></p>The moment he said it, Amane felt miserably embarrassed at his own request. Mahiru
        <p></p>looked back at him, blinking repeatedly, and stared at Amane's face.
        <p></p>Then, with an adorable, bashful look, she answered, "Okay by me. I'll throw in an ear
        <p></p>cleaning for you, so prepare to be pampered."
        <p></p>She puffed out her chest, looking like she had no doubt Amane would make it into the
        <p></p>top ten.
        <p></p>"We're here!"
        <p></p>The Saturday before the tests, as planned, Itsuki, Chitose, and Yuuta showed up around
        <p></p>ten in the morning, called out a greeting in unison from the doorway, and shuffled over
        <p></p>the threshold.
        <p></p>Apparently, the three of them had grown up in the same neighborhood, and it had been
        <p></p>convenient for them to meet up before coming over. They met up first also because
        <p></p>Yuuta didn't know where Amane's apartment was, but the main reason was probably
        <p></p>because they were already good friends.
        <p></p>Amane welcomed them. "Great, come on in."
        <p></p>"Where's Mahiru?" Chitose asked.
        <p></p>"In the kitchen, getting lunch ready."
        <p></p>So that they didn't have to worry about their midday meal, Mahiru had come over to
        <p></p>Amane's apartment ahead of time to prepare it. She had made a trip to a supermarket
        <p></p>that opened early in the morning to buy the ingredients.
        <p></p>She was making roast beef and wanted to let it slowly cook so that by lunch, it would
        <p></p>be just the right tenderness and ready to eat.
        <p></p>"…You two are getting awfully comfortable…," Itsuki whispered.
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>"You guys are like a newlyweds, welcoming your colleagues over for a meal."
        <p></p>"One more word, and you won't get any lunch," Amane threatened.
        <p></p>"No way! I'm eating Mahiru's cooking!"
        <p></p>Warning Itsuki to keep his mischief to a minimum, Amane looked over at Yuuta, who
        <p></p>was staring at him, slightly astonished.
        <p></p>"What's up, Yuuta?"
        <p></p>"…It's just, Shiina seems so at home here in your apartment, Fujimiya," he replied.
        <p></p>"…It'd almost be weirder if she wasn't," Amane grumbled. "…Since she's always making
        <p></p>food for me."
        <p></p>Amane turned away abruptly and saw Itsuki grinning with his hands over his mouth.
        <p></p>It reminded him of the way his mother smiled, which made him angry, and he kicked
        <p></p>Itsuki lightly in the shin.
        <p></p>"Welcome, everyone…," Mahiru said as she emerged from the kitchen. "Oh, Akazawa,
        <p></p>what happened?"
        <p></p>Amane scoffed. "Don't worry about him."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked worried about Itsuki, who seemed to be wearing a mysterious smile. It
        <p></p>wasn't anything she needed to worry about, and Amane wished she would just ignore
        <p></p>it.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to conclude that Itsuki's expression was nothing to be concerned
        <p></p>about, so even though she still looked curious, she put on her usual smile and returned
        <p></p>to the kitchen with a flutter of her apron. "I've got a little more preparation to do in
        <p></p>there, so please go ahead into the living room."
        <p></p>Watching her leave, Itsuki mumbled, "She is absolutely brimming with just-married
        <p></p>wife energy." This time, Amane slapped him on the back.
        <p></p>They waited for Mahiru to finish her work in the kitchen, and after she was done, she
        <p></p>brought out tea. "Well, should we get to studying?" she asked, taking a seat next to
        <p></p>Amane. The other three had made sure to leave that spot open.
        <p></p>"Yeah!"
        <p></p>"All right, what parts don't you understand, Chitose? We covered English yesterday
        <p></p>and were planning to work on math today, right?"
        <p></p>"Everything," Chitose replied.
        <p></p>Mahiru balked. "E-everything…?"
        <p></p>"Chi is not very good at math," Itsuki commented. "She barely avoided failing last time."
        <p></p>Chitose wasn't completely hopeless, but that was her weakest subject, and she
        <p></p>announced after every test that only divine intervention had kept her from failing.
        <p></p>The word "everything" caused Mahiru's cheek to twitch slightly, but since math was
        <p></p>Chitose's weakness, there really was no helping it. They would be lucky if she managed
        <p></p>to understand the basics.
        <p></p>"She has a hard time with applied problems, so the best thing would be to show her
        <p></p>how to use the formulas with each exercise, I think," Itsuki said.
        <p></p>"Is she all right on the formulas?" Mahiru asked Itsuki.
        <p></p>"…You're okay there, right?" Itsuki asked Chitose.
        <p></p>"Probably." Chitose nodded.
        <p></p>Amane got the feeling that Chitose was not actually okay, and that Mahiru had her
        <p></p>work cut out for her. Chitose wasn't exactly dumb; she just couldn't solve the problems
        <p></p>because she didn't know how to use the formulas. So as long as she learned how, she
        <p></p>ought to be able to get a decent score, for her anyway.
        <p></p>"You almost seem motivated now, Itsuki," Amane observed.
        <p></p>"Ha-ha-ha!"
        <p></p>"Don't try to laugh it off; get to studying."
        <p></p>Why do you think we organized this study session? Amane thought to himself.
        <p></p>"Yuuutaaa, Amane's being mean!" Itsuki whined playfully.
        <p></p>"You'd better shape up soon, then."
        <p></p>With a bright smile, Yuuta refused to rescue Itsuki, who let his shoulders droop
        <p></p>dejectedly.
        <p></p>Yuuta himself had already studiously opened his textbook and notebook to get started.
        <p></p>Amane wished that Itsuki and Chitose would follow his example.
        <p></p>Yuuta didn't seem to have any particularly weak subjects. He was an outstanding
        <p></p>student who had above-average scores across the board.
        <p></p>Amane also wasn't worried about any subject in particular—all he had left was to
        <p></p>polish up his memorization and application skills.
        <p></p>He entrusted the task of tutoring Chitose to Mahiru and lowered his gaze to the world
        <p></p>history textbook that he had set out for himself.
        <p></p>Amane and the others continued studying after lunch, but eventually, around midafternoon, Chitose seemed to reach the limits of her concentration and leaned back in
        <p></p>her chair. "I'm exhausted! Hey, Amane, could we play a video game?"
        <p></p>"You're free to play if you want, but I can't make any promises about your grades…"
        <p></p>"Geez, you're so strict."
        <p></p>"It's because you never just play a little bit. If you think you can control yourself, then
        <p></p>I suppose you can go ahead," he replied while solving a workbook problem, signaling
        <p></p>that he was going to continue studying. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Chitose
        <p></p>puff out her cheeks a little.
        <p></p>Amane had predicted it was only a matter of time before Chitose got bored of studying,
        <p></p>an activity he knew she hated. That was why he had put four controllers and several
        <p></p>games beside the console in his TV stand.
        <p></p>A human's attention span can only last so long, so he figured it wouldn't be so bad for
        <p></p>his friends to play and take a breather.
        <p></p>On the other hand, Amane had no problem studying some more. Since they started, he
        <p></p>took a short break every hour, and in the first place, he didn't mind studying. He could
        <p></p>keep going for quite a long time if he wanted to.
        <p></p>"You're no fun, Amane!" Chitose huffed.
        <p></p>"This is supposed to be a study party, right? I guess it's fine if you really want to play.
        <p></p>I've got four controllers, so how about you take a short break?"
        <p></p>"Okay, I'll accept your offer, but… you shouldn't push yourself too hard, okay?"
        <p></p>"I've been taking breaks."
        <p></p>"What a dedicated student! You've always been so serious, Amane. All right, then, I'm
        <p></p>gonna game. Let's play, Itsuki."
        <p></p>"Yeah, sure. But we can't waste all of our time."
        <p></p>Amane was not surprised that Itsuki also seemed tired after the three or so hours of
        <p></p>studying and was keen to play a game.
        <p></p>"Wanna join, Yuuta?" he asked.
        <p></p>"Sure, why not? Is it all right, Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"Mmm." Amane nodded.
        <p></p>Even Yuuta, who was more serious about his studies than Itsuki or Chitose, was
        <p></p>showing interest in taking a short break. Amane confirmed that Yuuta was free to join
        <p></p>the others, then looked back down at his workbook.
        <p></p>Beside him, Mahiru was quietly working on solving a set of problems. She was as
        <p></p>focused as before and showed no signs of stopping.
        <p></p>"You're not going to play, Mahiru?" he asked her.
        <p></p>"I'm going to study a little more," Mahiru replied.
        <p></p>"I see."
        <p></p>Amane had vowed to start taking his studies seriously, which was the only reason he
        <p></p>wasn't stopping, but Mahiru had a natural affinity for studying, and he couldn't help
        <p></p>but admire her diligence.
        <p></p>She'd probably continue ranking first place on the exams since she never failed to put
        <p></p>in the effort—that dedication was just another reason why Mahiru was so incredible.
        <p></p>After watching the other three excitedly get up from the table and start taking up
        <p></p>positions in front of the television, Amane put them out of his mind and went back to
        <p></p>work. He could hear pencil lead scratching against paper, the sound of the eraser
        <p></p>rubbing out the marks, and, very clearly, the sound of Mahiru's breathing at his side.
        <p></p>While listening half-heartedly to the animated voices of his friends nearby, Amane
        <p></p>focused on remembering which questions the teachers tended to choose for exams.
        <p></p>Several of his teachers had been teaching him since his first year of high school, and
        <p></p>he knew that those teachers' tests were relatively easy. And from their personalities
        <p></p>and the way they conducted their classes, he could guess what sections of the material
        <p></p>they would pull from, especially since he remembered their style from the previous
        <p></p>year. Amane felt pretty certain that he could predict what they would put on their
        <p></p>tests.
        <p></p>He had even told Chitose about which sections of the textbook the test questions
        <p></p>would most likely cover. It was just a calculated guess, but he had never been wrong
        <p></p>before, so if she prioritized those areas when she studied, she would probably at least
        <p></p>avoid failing.
        <p></p>"Amane, here."
        <p></p>While he was solving problems in silence, Mahiru had stood up unnoticed, and now
        <p></p>she set a cup of coffee down in front of him.
        <p></p>He smiled at the beverage, which he guessed had one small sugar cube and a single
        <p></p>portion of milk stirred in.
        <p></p>"The usual is all right, yeah?"
        <p></p>"Mm. Thank you."
        <p></p>They had been spending time together for half a year, so they had gotten to know each
        <p></p>other's tastes.
        <p></p>Feeling grateful toward Mahiru, who had brought the coffee over right when he started
        <p></p>to get a craving, Amane wrapped his fingers around the mug handle, then realized that
        <p></p>she had also placed a small plate before him.
        <p></p>"What's this?"
        <p></p>"A financier. I baked them yesterday, thinking we would need some sugar to fuel our
        <p></p>brains."
        <p></p>On the little plate sat one bite-sized financier, baked to a perfect golden brown. A
        <p></p>toothpick stuck out of the top of the small cake, so that he could pick it up without
        <p></p>getting his fingers dirty. Mahiru had probably made them bite-size so that they could
        <p></p>be enjoyed in the spare moments between studying.
        <p></p>Mahiru had also dutifully set out cakes for Itsuki and the others still playing the video
        <p></p>game. Theirs were slightly larger and served on plates that sat together on a platter.
        <p></p>Mahiru had also prepared coffee for the three of them, but the milk and sugar were
        <p></p>self-serve, with sugar packets and little pots of cream laid out on the platter.
        <p></p>With a smile, she quietly approached the gamers and set the tray down on a table
        <p></p>nearby. "You should all have some, too."
        <p></p>"Wow! Thank you, Mahiru!"
        <p></p>"Oh, snacks! Perfect timing, too. Thank you, Shiina."
        <p></p>"It's nothing, really."
        <p></p>Mahiru returned to the table, gazing happily at the trio now enjoying their snack time,
        <p></p>and Amane felt his lips curling into a smile as well.
        <p></p>"…I sort of feel like I made you prepare a lot of stuff."
        <p></p>"No, I did it because I wanted to," Mahiru insisted. "And I did everything in between
        <p></p>studying, so it was a good way to take breaks."
        <p></p>"You're the type of person who always goes all out, seriously."
        <p></p>"…I just use my time on the people I want to use it on."
        <p></p>Amane felt a hot lump rising up in his throat when she mumbled these words in a
        <p></p>quiet voice.
        <p></p>He washed it down with a swig of coffee. Mahiru hadn't added any extra sugar, but it
        <p></p>somehow seemed particularly sweet.
        <p></p>The sweetness wasn't unpleasant, and he wasn't sure how he should respond to what
        <p></p>Mahiru had said, so Amane stared back down at his workbook, to fool himself into
        <p></p>thinking he had nothing to say.
        <p></p>In the end, the gaming tournament lasted well into the evening.
        <p></p>Amane eventually took a break from his studies and joined in, too, when he found that
        <p></p>he could no longer focus. Except it wasn't just the fatigue of hours of study that affected
        <p></p>Amane's concentration.
        <p></p>What did she mean, she uses her energy on the people she wants to use it on?
        <p></p>Amane had been replaying Mahiru's quiet murmuring over and over again in his head.
        <p></p>He had always known that Mahiru did things for the people she liked, but when she
        <p></p>put it that way, it sounded like she held some special affection for Amane.
        <p></p>Amane certainly thought that Mahiru liked him, but his understanding was that it
        <p></p>wasn't in a romantic way.
        <p></p>The way she'd said that made him wonder if she was doing everything because she
        <p></p>liked him, not as a friend… His mind was running wild with the idea.
        <p></p>I mean, I would understand if she was doing all this work because I'm such a failure of a
        <p></p>human being, and she felt like she just had to step in, but…
        <p></p>In fact, Amane was bad enough at housework that he couldn't rule out the possibility.
        <p></p>He could survive on his own, if he really tried, but he did rely on Mahiru a lot.
        <p></p>He couldn't decide whether Mahiru just wanted to look after him, or whether she was
        <p></p>being overly caring because she was into him. Given his feelings for her, Amane would
        <p></p>have liked to imagine that it was the latter, and he didn't think that it was completely
        <p></p>hopeless. However, he still had serious doubts about whether he was the kind of
        <p></p>person Mahiru could ever actually love.
        <p></p>"…Amane? You fell out of the ring."
        <p></p>"Huh…?"
        <p></p>Amane had gotten lost in thought in the middle of a game, and unknowingly let his
        <p></p>character go out of bounds. Since he didn't have any more lives left, he was knocked
        <p></p>out of the game.
        <p></p>A close match unfolded between Itsuki, Chitose, and Yuuta. Amane hadn't expected
        <p></p>Yuuta to be so good at video games.
        <p></p>Normally, Amane would never make such an obvious mistake. That was how
        <p></p>distracted he was by Mahiru's comment.
        <p></p>"Your concentration must really be shot from studying, Amane. You're spaced out."
        <p></p>"…Must be," Amane agreed. "Mahiru, you want in on the next game?"
        <p></p>"No, I've got to get dinner ready soon, so…"
        <p></p>Mahiru glanced at the clock, and when Amane followed her gaze, he saw that it was
        <p></p>just short of seven o'clock. It was probably a little bit late to start dinner preparations.
        <p></p>"Oh, she's right, it's already so late… I've got to get going. I can't stay over, after all,"
        <p></p>Chitose said.
        <p></p>"Yeah, I'm sure you would have liked to stay at Shiina's place, Chi, but we didn't bring
        <p></p>you a change of clothes or anything. Plus, you didn't ask, and I doubt you would fit into
        <p></p>any of her clothes, after all…"
        <p></p>"Tell me, my darling Itsuki, just what do you mean by that?"
        <p></p>"I'm talking about your heights, of course, yes."
        <p></p>Mahiru giggled as she watched the couple cheerfully bicker, as they always did. "Come
        <p></p>over and stay next time."
        <p></p>"You sure?"
        <p></p>"I'm sure. As long as you tell me ahead of time."
        <p></p>"Well then, I'll stay over at Amane's at the same time," Itsuki added.
        <p></p>Amane frowned. "I have a feeling you're just angling for a meal…"
        <p></p>"You got me. Her cooking is just too delicious!" Itsuki laughed, with no ill intent.
        <p></p>With a sigh, Amane told him, "You know you've got to ask Mahiru, right?"
        <p></p>Mahiru would be the one who had to make all the extra food, so Amane couldn't very
        <p></p>well volunteer her.
        <p></p>If she didn't agree, then the boys could eat out or get convenience store food, which
        <p></p>would feel more like a party anyway, so it wouldn't be the worst thing.
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded her approval with a smile, and Amane had a feeling Chitose and Itsuki
        <p></p>would be staying over soon.
        <p></p>"Will Kadowaki be coming next time, too?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"Oh, could I?"
        <p></p>"Well…," Amane began.
        <p></p>"If you come, let's have a 'kick Amane's butt into gear' party!" Itsuki interrupted.
        <p></p>"Hey, where do you get off planning weird parties?"
        <p></p>"Come on, how 'bout it?"
        <p></p>Amane's cheek twitched as Itsuki put on a broad grin. Yuuta was taken aback for a
        <p></p>moment but then smiled with relief.
        <p></p>"Hey, Mahiru?… What did you mean when you said that you use your energy on the
        <p></p>people you want to use it on?"
        <p></p>While they were standing in the entryway after seeing everybody else off, Amane
        <p></p>falteringly asked her the question that had been weighing on his mind all evening.
        <p></p>He had been wavering over whether to ask her about it, but he had been grumbling
        <p></p>about not knowing what to do as Itsuki left, and Itsuki had given him a little kick and
        <p></p>said, "Don't worry about it, man, just ask."
        <p></p>Amane hadn't been expecting a literal "kick in the butt," so he'd smacked Itsuki in
        <p></p>retaliation. Itsuki hadn't seemed particularly likely to learn his lesson, so it had felt
        <p></p>like a futile gesture.
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked at Amane. Slowly, the corners of her mouth curled into a smile. "…What
        <p></p>do you think I meant?"
        <p></p>"Like, that you can't let this useless guy out of your sight for a minute?"
        <p></p>Amane was too self-conscious to say anything rash, as he didn't want to come off as
        <p></p>arrogant.
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, well, that's true. I'm afraid to take my eye off you. If I wasn't here, you'd
        <p></p>really be in trouble."
        <p></p>"I can't argue with that."
        <p></p>Mahiru truly did take extremely good care of him. If she wasn't around, Amane would
        <p></p>never be able to maintain his current lifestyle.
        <p></p>"…It's fine, you know? I like taking care of you, Amane."
        <p></p>"I'd let myself go to pieces… without you, I'd fall apart and wither away…"
        <p></p>"Heh-heh."
        <p></p>The frightening thing about Mahiru was that Amane knew that if she left, his whole
        <p></p>life would become an emotional wreck.
        <p></p>In several senses, he had become something like her prisoner. It would be impossible
        <p></p>for him to leave her—and he didn't want to. Needless to say, the main reason was
        <p></p>because he was in love with her.
        <p></p>If he were to confess his feelings and be rejected, he was sure he would feel like death,
        <p></p>emotionally and physically. Amane laughed at himself but didn't tell her that was why
        <p></p>he hadn't been able to move forward.
        <p></p>Mahiru stepped toward him, inexplicably. She didn't press up against him, but she was
        <p></p>close enough that they were just lightly touching. She drew close to Amane until she
        <p></p>was right in front of him and looked up—then with her index finger, she traced the
        <p></p>outline of his lips.
        <p></p>"…I'm going to spoil you as much as I like, so just relax and enjoy it, okay?"
        <p></p>Mahiru narrowed her eyes impishly at Amane. He realized he'd forgotten how to
        <p></p>breathe.
        <p></p>Mahiru was wearing a smile he had never seen before. It was sweet, yet provocative…
        <p></p>even enchanting. It could even be called devilish and was enough to bewitch anyone.
        <p></p>Amane could feel it tugging at his emotions.
        <p></p>He could also feel his heart pounding and the blood rushing through his veins.
        <p></p>Amane had seen many of Mahiru's smiles, from her beautiful angelic one, to a subtle,
        <p></p>vanishing smirk, to a cherubic grin, but she had never given him such a flirtatious look
        <p></p>before.
        <p></p>She gazed with satisfaction at Amane, still frozen in place, then reverted to her usual
        <p></p>smile as she headed for the kitchen. "Well, I'm going to go make dinner."
        <p></p>Amane watched her go, cheeks burning.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 45: Before the Test, a Moment 
        <p></p>The Sunday before the start of exams, Amane was studying quietly in his own room.
        <p></p>He wanted to get high marks, but there was also another reason he was studying—he
        <p></p>was trying to drive thoughts of Mahiru out of his head.
        <p></p>"…I'm going to spoil you as much as I like, so just relax and enjoy it, okay?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had whispered those unbelievable words with a devilish smile, and now
        <p></p>thoughts of her threatened to fill his head, leaving room for nothing else.
        <p></p>Amane didn't know whether Mahiru's recent suggestive behavior toward him was
        <p></p>intentional, but it was certainly effective. He appreciated it, but at the same time, it
        <p></p>made him nervous.
        <p></p>Until he was sure of Mahiru's intentions, he couldn't really make a move.
        <p></p>All sorts of questions troubled him, so to drive them all away, he'd been studying
        <p></p>furiously since early morning. His efforts were at least somewhat successful, because
        <p></p>he'd gotten so caught up in the work that by the time he realized, it was past two in
        <p></p>the afternoon.
        <p></p>The fact that he had worked straight through without eating lunch was proof of how
        <p></p>focused he had been, but now that he had noticed the time and checked the clock, his
        <p></p>stomach immediately growled with hunger.
        <p></p>"…I guess I should at least eat lunch."
        <p></p>Amane stretched out to relieve some of the stiffness that had built up after sitting in
        <p></p>one place for so long. Then he stood up and left his room.
        <p></p>Mahiru had said she would be home alone studying for exams that day, and she hadn't
        <p></p>come over to Amane's. That meant Amane would have to fix lunch on his own.
        <p></p>Thinking about how he'd been spoiled with good food since meeting Mahiru, he
        <p></p>headed for the kitchen and opened the refrigerator.
        <p></p>He put a frozen portion of rice that had been set aside for quick use into the
        <p></p>microwave, and while it was thawing, he took a bowl and scooped out several types of
        <p></p>the preserved vegetables that Mahiru had prepared ahead of time, guaranteeing some
        <p></p>color and nutrients for his meal.
        <p></p>All of this is Mahiru's doing.
        <p></p>If it had been just Amane, he wouldn't have prepared any vegetables. His lunch
        <p></p>would've come from the convenience store.
        <p></p>Now he had a fair amount of food in the house, and he also knew how to make some
        <p></p>things himself. They weren't on the same level as Mahiru's cooking, which was always
        <p></p>delicious, lovely to look at, and nutritious to boot. Still, he had learned to make some
        <p></p>edible dishes.
        <p></p>Using what he'd learned from Mahiru, Amane made a simple fried rice for lunch with
        <p></p>just eggs and bacon. But the meal turned out to be plenty colorful thanks to the side
        <p></p>dishes Mahiru had prepared.
        <p></p>With the addition of instant Chinese-style soup, it was a perfectly satisfactory menu
        <p></p>for an easy lunch.
        <p></p>He loaded it all on a tray and carried it over to the dining table.
        <p></p>"Let's eat."
        <p></p>He smiled softly as he looked down at a weekend lunch that he previously would have
        <p></p>had trouble imagining. Then he pressed his hands together in thanks and picked up
        <p></p>his spoon.
        <p></p>The fried rice that he brought to his mouth had a somewhat strong flavor, different
        <p></p>from Mahiru's, but it wasn't bad. It turned out to be well seasoned for something
        <p></p>prepared by a high school boy.
        <p></p>It's really different, huh?
        <p></p>Amane's eating habits had completely changed, and so had various other things about
        <p></p>him. In all sorts of ways, he had become completely spoiled.
        <p></p>He wondered if he was becoming a better person in his daily life. After experiencing
        <p></p>life with Mahiru, Amane didn't want to return to his previous existence—now that he
        <p></p>knew life could be this good, he didn't want to go back. He had become really spoiled,
        <p></p>in the sense that he felt he would never be satisfied if Mahiru left.
        <p></p>He wasn't only pampered in all practical aspects of life; he was spoiled emotionally as
        <p></p>well.
        <p></p>Amane remembered something he had heard before from his father, Shuuto.
        <p></p>Apparently, the Fujimiya men were the earnestly devoted type. The type who falls in
        <p></p>love with only one person and then treasures them.
        <p></p>Amane did not have to think about whether he too had inherited those tendencies.
        <p></p>Ever since he had become aware that he was in love with Mahiru, he paid even less
        <p></p>attention to other girls. The most important thing was that he wanted to treasure
        <p></p>Mahiru and make her happy.
        <p></p>…I won't settle for anyone but Mahiru.
        <p></p>Whether he was the one to bring her joy or not, as long as Mahiru was happy, he
        <p></p>decided he would back off right away if she fell for someone else and chose that person
        <p></p>instead. He told himself that seeing Mahiru smiling joyfully was enough.
        <p></p>However, he also had contradictory feelings. He really wanted to be the one to make
        <p></p>her happy, and he definitely didn't want to give her away. He didn't want to be apart
        <p></p>from Mahiru, and he liked being the only one who really knew her.
        <p></p>Some people would probably call what he was feeling an obsession—his heart was
        <p></p>full of emotions that he could not explain to anyone else, like the feeling that he just
        <p></p>couldn't live without Mahiru.
        <p></p>She wasn't just a pretty face; she had a pure heart as well. Amane had frankly been
        <p></p>manipulated by the deep, strong feeling of love that was in his heart.
        <p></p>"…I wouldn't have so much trouble if I was more assertive."
        <p></p>Amane laughed a little. The words that he had muttered out loud naturally had a selfdeprecating ring to them.
        <p></p>For the first time in his sixteen years of life, he was in love with someone, and he
        <p></p>wanted to be the one by her side, but he had no idea how to make that happen.
        <p></p>Anyone else would probably have laughed, if they knew that he had made it to sixteen
        <p></p>without experiencing his first love.
        <p></p>He was aware that he had a craven and cautious nature, and that he didn't know the
        <p></p>first thing about approaching girls. He believed that these qualities had helped earn
        <p></p>Mahiru's trust, and that they weren't things that he could change easily. But he had
        <p></p>always wished that he could be more assertive.
        <p></p>That was exactly why he was working so hard at his studies and making an effort to
        <p></p>exercise. He was trying to gain some self-confidence.
        <p></p>With a quiet, bitter smile, Amane scarfed down the rest of the fried rice.
        <p></p>Amane took a short break after eating to limber up his stiff muscles with some more
        <p></p>stretching, and while he was at it, he decided to do some light exercise to relax. He
        <p></p>changed into running clothes in his room.
        <p></p>He had been sitting at his desk for a while, so he figured a bit of physical activity would
        <p></p>be a good change of pace.
        <p></p>Still, he didn't have that much stamina. He would need to reserve some energy for
        <p></p>studying more later. He was sure that he would sleep like a log that night.
        <p></p>Reminding himself to be careful not to overdo it, Amane stepped through the door, and
        <p></p>happened to meet Mahiru just as she was walking out of her own apartment.
        <p></p>"Ah, Amane… Going to exercise?"
        <p></p>She could clearly tell by his outfit. She gave him a charming smile, and he nodded in
        <p></p>response. Mahiru was dressed like she was going out, so Amane figured he must have
        <p></p>caught her just as she was leaving.
        <p></p>For a second, he remembered what had happened the day before and almost groaned
        <p></p>out loud, but he had calmed down a little since then, so he didn't get flustered from
        <p></p>just seeing her.
        <p></p>"Yeah, I need a break," he replied. "You too? Looks like you're going shopping."
        <p></p>"Yes. Speaking of which, I remember being low on eggs. I thought I'd make rolled
        <p></p>omelets for dinner tonight. We've got exams tomorrow, and if I leave some for
        <p></p>breakfast, they might help you do your best…"
        <p></p>"Seriously? Suddenly I feel a surge of energy!"
        <p></p>"I'm doing it for my sake, too, you know." Mahiru put a hand over her mouth and
        <p></p>giggled a little.
        <p></p>Amane answered, frowning slightly, "I can't help myself; you make the best omelets."
        <p></p>This brought the conversation to a pause, but both knew that Amane wasn't actually
        <p></p>upset. Through the gaps in Mahiru's fingers, he could see her smile widen.
        <p></p>"Ah, that's right, I used the last egg and also some bacon earlier. And I ate one of the
        <p></p>frozen portions of rice."
        <p></p>"Oh, you made your own lunch?" Mahiru remarked. "Impressive."
        <p></p>"…I feel like you're making fun of me. I believe I do cook occasionally even when you're
        <p></p>over."
        <p></p>Naturally, Amane felt bad about leaving all the cooking to Mahiru, so he usually tried
        <p></p>to help her with simple tasks, and on days when Mahiru seemed to be tired or feeling
        <p></p>down, he would take over and make the meals.
        <p></p>There were limits to what he could make, so sometimes the menu deviated
        <p></p>considerably from what they had planned on. Disregarding the presentation and
        <p></p>accepting that the flavor would be inferior to Mahiru's food, Amane was capable of
        <p></p>cooking a passable meal.
        <p></p>So there was no reason for her to praise him like that just because he had made lunch.
        <p></p>"I know that, but you hardly ever do it when you're home alone, right? You tend to
        <p></p>choose instant meals when you're by yourself, because cooking is a pain and you're
        <p></p>fine with something easy."
        <p></p>"Uh—"
        <p></p>"Guessing from the ingredients and from your repertoire, I bet you made fried rice or
        <p></p>something like that. It sounds like you did a good job, so that's great."
        <p></p>Amane was at a loss for words. She saw right through him. He thought he could feel
        <p></p>his blood begin to boil.
        <p></p>Mahiru broke the tension when she laughed out loud and extended a hand toward
        <p></p>Amane. She gently combed her fingers through his hair, fluffing it up as she hit him
        <p></p>with a charming smile.
        <p></p>Amane pursed his lips tightly. He didn't hate the feeling; rather, it made him happy. He
        <p></p>really had become spoiled.
        <p></p>"…Knock it off already, geez."
        <p></p>"Aw, too bad. I wanted to do it more."
        <p></p>As she said that, Mahiru readily pulled away and smiled gently.
        <p></p>It occurred to Amane that his serious expression was only making things worse, and
        <p></p>he turned away from her.
        <p></p>"…Are eggs the only thing you're buying?"
        <p></p>He changed the subject so that Mahiru couldn't pet him anymore.
        <p></p>"Let's see, there are other ingredients I need for dinner, like the eggs… and milk, but
        <p></p>that should do it, I think. I was planning to make a quick trip, so I figured I'd just go to
        <p></p>the closest grocery store."
        <p></p>"Got it. I can pick all that up on my way back home."
        <p></p>Amane wouldn't have said anything if Mahiru had other errands or shopping to do
        <p></p>besides for groceries, things he couldn't do in her stead. But if she didn't have anything
        <p></p>else to go out for, there was no reason for her to spend the extra time and effort.
        <p></p>Amane was going outside anyway, so it would be better to have her stay home and do
        <p></p>something else she wanted to do. She spent time every night making him dinner, so he
        <p></p>figured he should at least do this much.
        <p></p>"Huh? But then you'll have to carry it all."
        <p></p>"It's fine, I'll go shopping on my way back. And it's not like the grocery store is that far."
        <p></p>"Wh-what about money?"
        <p></p>"I've got my cash card with me. And I've already checked the balance. I can get a receipt
        <p></p>from the supermarket, so there won't be any problem with splitting the bill or
        <p></p>anything."
        <p></p>Amane cocked his head as to ask if there was anything else, and this time, Mahiru
        <p></p>fumbled over her words.
        <p></p>"…Sorry to make you do this."
        <p></p>"I told you, it's fine; I'm going out anyway."
        <p></p>Amane ruffled Mahiru's hair in retaliation, and she looked at him with narrowed eyes
        <p></p>as if he was tickling her. Something in her expression looked genuinely happy, and
        <p></p>Amane was quietly relieved that he hadn't committed some grave mistake.
        <p></p>"…All right, I'll leave it to you. I'll be waiting at home."
        <p></p>"Whose home?"
        <p></p>"I wonder?"
        <p></p>Mahiru tilted her head slightly to the side, looking bashful. Then without missing a
        <p></p>beat, she opened the door to Amane's apartment, using the spare key that she had
        <p></p>been holding already, and slipped in smoothly through the crack.
        <p></p>Having made her answer obvious, Mahiru peeked back out through the door and
        <p></p>smiled at Amane.
        <p></p>"See you when you get back, Amane."
        <p></p>"…I'm going now," he replied, feeling amused by Mahiru, who no longer seemed to care
        <p></p>whose apartment was whose.
        <p></p>Mahiru's smile grew wider as she waved good-bye to Amane.
        <p></p>After warming up with some light stretching, Amane went for an easy jog that lasted
        <p></p>a little less than an hour, and then made a trip to the supermarket as part of his
        <p></p>cooldown before returning home.
        <p></p>Since he was jogging, he was able to relax and exercise without overthinking, and his
        <p></p>mind quieted a little bit. For now, things seemed to have settled down without him
        <p></p>having to respond to all of Mahiru's provocations, so he returned home feeling
        <p></p>relieved. With the quiet shuffling of her house slippers, Mahiru came to greet him at
        <p></p>the door.
        <p></p>"Welcome home. I went ahead and filled the bath with hot water. Want to get in?"
        <p></p>She casually took the shopping bags out of his hands, and he found himself gaping at
        <p></p>her.
        <p></p>Itsuki and Yuuta had both said that she acted exactly like a newlywed wife, and she
        <p></p>really did. Mahiru herself probably didn't intend it that way, but her movements were
        <p></p>brisk and efficient, and somebody who didn't know better might have made that
        <p></p>assumption. Amane felt strangely embarrassed by the thought.
        <p></p>"…Amane?"
        <p></p>"Ah, it's nothing. Thank you, I will go take a bath."
        <p></p>He smiled vaguely in response to the strange look from Mahiru, rinsed his hands at
        <p></p>the sink, then headed for his room to get ready for the bath.
        <p></p>He pulled out his usual loungewear, and then went into the bathroom, where, as
        <p></p>Mahiru had said, the bathtub was full of piping hot water and set to the perfect
        <p></p>temperature.
        <p></p>After saying a silent thanks to Mahiru for being so prepared and generally being there
        <p></p>for him, he showered off the sweat from his run.
        <p></p>Amane was self-indulgent and lazy at heart, but that didn't mean he was okay with
        <p></p>being dirty. He was someone who enjoyed a good bath.
        <p></p>When he submerged himself in the bathtub after properly washing the filth off his
        <p></p>body and hair, it felt like all the fatigue in his mind and body melted away. He realized
        <p></p>that he was pretty worn out as the exhaustion seemed to dissolve in the hot water.
        <p></p>As he soaked in the bathwater that was just the right temperature, Amane leaned back
        <p></p>against the side of the tub and exhaled.
        <p></p>Then he looked down at his body through the clear water—he hadn't added bath salts
        <p></p>or anything to it—and his exhale turned into a sigh.
        <p></p>"…Still got a lot of work to do, huh?"
        <p></p>It hadn't been very long since he'd started really exercising, so it was to be expected.
        <p></p>Amane had very little muscle on his body because he had never trained and ate
        <p></p>properly. He was extremely thin, a far cry from his image of masculinity. The words
        <p></p>bean sprout came immediately to mind.
        <p></p>Amane wanted to get a little stronger and improve his looks while he was at it. Some
        <p></p>of his classmates had seen him in his "mystery man" form before, so he couldn't
        <p></p>heedlessly assume that look without attracting suspicion, but he knew that he could
        <p></p>be more diligent with his skin care and grooming.
        <p></p>He admired Mahiru, who was never negligent in her daily self-care. He was sure that
        <p></p>she must put in a lot of work that he wasn't even aware of.
        <p></p>As he thought about all these things, Amane felt a considerable drowsiness creep over
        <p></p>him, probably from the comfortable warmth of the water and his own fatigue. He let
        <p></p>out another deep sigh as he began dozing off in the tub.
        <p></p>Eventually, Mahiru, concerned that he was taking too long in the bath, ended up
        <p></p>waking him in a panic when she opened the bathroom door to check on him.
        <p></p>"Um, you know… it's dangerous to stay in too long, okay?"
        <p></p>"I'm really sorry for being so careless."
        <p></p>All Amane could do was apologize earnestly. He wasn't sure whether Mahiru's flushed
        <p></p>cheeks were due to anger or embarrassment from glimpsing his top half in the bath—
        <p></p>he imagined it was at least partially from worry.
        <p></p>He had heard that people had drowned in as little as thirty centimeters of water, so
        <p></p>Mahiru's anger seemed justified. Amane imagined that she was all the more anxious
        <p></p>because she herself couldn't swim.
        <p></p>He tried to come up with some excuse, but his mind was in a fog.
        <p></p>He hadn't been completely asleep; really it was more like his consciousness was
        <p></p>dipping a toe into the ocean of slumber. He was confident that he would have woken
        <p></p>up without a problem if he had lost his balance and bumped into the side of the tub.
        <p></p>"…Why are you pushing yourself so hard?"
        <p></p>Amane felt instantly remorseful when he heard the suspicion in Mahiru's words. He
        <p></p>could tell that he'd messed up when he heard the anxiety in her voice, which made it
        <p></p>clear that he'd given her cause for stress.
        <p></p>"I won't deny the value of hard work," Mahiru continued, "but if you can't handle it all,
        <p></p>shouldn't you ease up a little?"
        <p></p>"You're right, of course. I'll be more careful next time."
        <p></p>"But why are you doing all this, Amane?" she asked again.
        <p></p>"…I guess… because I want to become someone I can be proud of."
        <p></p>Even though she sounded a little angry, Mahiru looked mostly sad. Amane smiled
        <p></p>meekly and stroked her head to try to wipe away the anxious look in her eyes, while
        <p></p>vowing not to make such a mistake again.
        <p></p>"I've been thinking I wanna be more confident in myself, is all. And I wanted to start
        <p></p>with things like my studies and exercise. I didn't mean to worry you; this was really all
        <p></p>my fault. Next time, I'll keep in mind how much I can handle."
        <p></p>"…Are you in that big of a hurry?"
        <p></p>"I guess there's probably no rush, but I want to work harder… To make myself into
        <p></p>someone I can be confident in. After all, I'm working hard for my own sake," Amane
        <p></p>told her with a smile as he rubbed her head.
        <p></p>Mahiru stared hard into Amane's eyes, then sighed. "…I understand your determination.
        <p></p>That said, I'm serious: If you don't take better care of yourself, I'm going to get really
        <p></p>worried, okay?"
        <p></p>"I said I was sorry."
        <p></p>"But I think you really shine when you try so hard, and I don't want to get in the way
        <p></p>of your progress. I've been watching you but trying not to get in your way."
        <p></p>"If anything, you're the one keeping me going," he insisted. "Taking care of meals is
        <p></p>really a huge help. I can't manage that as well as you can, after all."
        <p></p>"You're the one putting in all the effort, so it would be more accurate to say that it's all
        <p></p>I can do to help… Do your best, but don't push yourself too hard, okay?"
        <p></p>"I'll try not to make you worry again."
        <p></p>No doubt, he would be careful not to fall asleep in the bath again. He had no desire to
        <p></p>learn what drowning felt like.
        <p></p>Amane also didn't want to make Mahiru fret and cry, so he decided to take better care
        <p></p>of his physical health and not overexert himself.
        <p></p>Mahiru still looked a little skeptical, so he continued to try to reassure her by gently
        <p></p>stroking her hair.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 46: After the Test, a Moment 
        <p></p>Two days passed, and the tests were over. Amane felt liberated.
        <p></p>He surprisingly spent less time sitting at his desk during exams than when regular
        <p></p>classes were in session, and he found that test prep was easier than his usual studies.
        <p></p>Though this time around, there had been additional pressure, because he was more
        <p></p>invested in the outcome.
        <p></p>Typically, Amane put in a reasonable amount of effort and always got a decent score.
        <p></p>However, this time, he'd spent extra time studying and really focused on acing his
        <p></p>exams. He'd been a bit nervous going into the tests, but now that they were over, he
        <p></p>felt satisfied with his performance.
        <p></p>He had gotten together with Mahiru to compare their answers from the previous day's
        <p></p>tests, and although he hadn't gotten a perfect score, it seemed like he had gotten a very
        <p></p>good one. They would probably go over today's questions in detail once they got home,
        <p></p>and Amane was confident that he had answered better this time around.
        <p></p>Amane leaned back against his chair and let his body relax as he took a break. Chitose
        <p></p>staggered over, looking like she had been drained of all vitality.
        <p></p>"Amaneee, how'd it go?"
        <p></p>Her expression lacked its usual luster. Amane knew that Chitose was not a big fan of
        <p></p>studying. She was a quick learner but not the kind of person to put in the work, and in
        <p></p>this case, she didn't prepare enough.
        <p></p>"There wasn't anything specific that gave me trouble, so I think I did well," he
        <p></p>answered.
        <p></p>"Wow, you were really serious about it this time. You gonna ask me how I did?"
        <p></p>"Let me guess, you did terribly but somehow avoided failing?"
        <p></p>"You got it."
        <p></p>"After all that tutoring, it'd be a shame if you still failed."
        <p></p>Compared to Itsuki and Chitose, and even Yuuta, Mahiru and Amane were far enough
        <p></p>ahead in their studies that they had time to help Chitose so she could pass the tests.
        <p></p>Chitose's cheekiness and her attitude toward school often got in the way of her
        <p></p>studies, but fundamentally, she had a good head on her shoulders and wasn't bad at
        <p></p>understanding the material—so as long as it was taught well, she would grasp it
        <p></p>quickly.
        <p></p>As for whether she would retain the information after the tests, that depended on
        <p></p>whether she ever bothered to review it.
        <p></p>"It's fine, it's fine! I did better than ever before!" she said triumphantly.
        <p></p>"Glad to hear it. Not that the bar was all that high, but… as long as you're happy, I'm
        <p></p>happy. Just remember to work hard at the end of the semester, too."
        <p></p>"Whaa—? We just finished these tests; don't talk about the next ones… that's
        <p></p>depressing… Right now, I want to celebrate our freedom! Right, Itsuki?"
        <p></p>"That's right! We shouldn't spend the present dwelling on the past or thinking about
        <p></p>some far-off future."
        <p></p>Itsuki, slumped listlessly in his chair behind Amane, groaned and agreed with what
        <p></p>Chitose had said. Itsuki had obviously studied more seriously than Chitose, but the
        <p></p>English exam had practically done him in, and he had no energy left.
        <p></p>"I want to compare my test answers with someone, though," Amane said.
        <p></p>"No way! Don't make us think about the tests anymore!"
        <p></p>Itsuki and Chitose clung to each other, looking absolutely exhausted, commiserating
        <p></p>over their trials and tribulations.
        <p></p>"You seem lively enough to me," Amane grumbled, and shifted his gaze to the throng
        <p></p>of people in the classroom who had finished their exams.
        <p></p>They were gathering one after another around Mahiru, probably to compare answers
        <p></p>with her.
        <p></p>They wanted to see Mahiru's answers, since she had gotten nearly perfect scores on
        <p></p>previous tests. With a humble smile, Mahiru pulled out her various answer sheets.
        <p></p>Amane had no desire to join the fray, so he would compare answers with her at home.
        <p></p>"…Must be tough."
        <p></p>He didn't call Mahiru by name, but it must have been clear who he meant.
        <p></p>Itsuki and Chitose both looked over at Mahiru and grinned.
        <p></p>"Well, the angel is cute, and clever, and popular, so she's in great demand."
        <p></p>"You could get in there too and help her out?"
        <p></p>"I don't see any need for that," he scoffed.
        <p></p>"Yeah, guess you're right."
        <p></p>"Plus, you'll be there when she gets home"—Itsuki didn't say that part out loud, but
        <p></p>Amane knew the logical conclusion of that train of thought. He was grateful to his
        <p></p>friend for not voicing it, but Itsuki's grinning face, which basically said he knew all
        <p></p>about it, was more than enough to make Amane irritable.
        <p></p>Itsuki laughed again at Amane's scowl, and the lines in Amane's forehead grew deeper.
        <p></p>Then he heard another voice laughing with amusement, and he relaxed his grimace
        <p></p>just a little.
        <p></p>"Itsuki, if you tease him too much, Fujimiya will pout," Yuuta remarked.
        <p></p>"He's fine, he's fine, Amane won't get mad at me just for that."
        <p></p>"It looked like the vein in his temple was going to pop just now, though."
        <p></p>"Uh-oh, I think you're right."
        <p></p>Yuuta surprised Amane by stepping in to arbitrate. He shrugged and decided not to
        <p></p>smack Itsuki after all.
        <p></p>"Fujimiya, how were your grades? Must be good, looking at your face."
        <p></p>"Well, I think I did fairly well," Amane nodded. "How about you?"
        <p></p>"Thanks to your help, I feel like I scored more points than usual," Yuuta said. "Though
        <p></p>I won't know until I compare answers with someone later."
        <p></p>"I see; that's good to hear."
        <p></p>Amane had been worried about everyone's results, since their Saturday study session
        <p></p>had turned into a video game tournament halfway through, but based on the
        <p></p>impression he was getting from Yuuta, it had worked out okay.
        <p></p>Amane's expression softened a little as he thought back on that day and mused that it
        <p></p>might be nice to get together and study like that sometimes. Itsuki's face then showed
        <p></p>a clear look of discontent.
        <p></p>"Hey, you're letting Yuuta off awfully easy, aren't you, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Don't worry about him; reflect on your own bad habits."
        <p></p>"I believe that I am loved, even when you say such things."
        <p></p>"Don't get creepy. I—"
        <p></p>"That's right, there's only one person in this world who Amane loves."
        <p></p>Even though he muttered it under his breath, Itsuki had still crossed a line. Amane
        <p></p>grabbed his friend in a solid headlock.
        <p></p>Yuuta laughed and made no attempt to interfere, as though he knew that Itsuki
        <p></p>deserved it.
        <p></p>Chitose also seemed amused. "Itsuki, you're a real dummy." She smirked.
        <p></p>Itsuki, who was getting a knuckle forcibly ground into his forehead, had a foolish smile
        <p></p>on his face, as if it didn't hurt at all.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't putting any real strength behind the attack, so it shouldn't have hurt
        <p></p>that much, but he couldn't help but feel a little annoyed at how calm Itsuki was acting.
        <p></p>"Well, you're definitely devoted, Fujimiya. That's easy to see."
        <p></p>"Not you too, Kadowaki…"
        <p></p>"Hey, I didn't say what you're devoted to, just that you're devoted!" Yuuta beamed.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't think of anything to say, so he just turned away.
        <p></p>His behavior must have been amusing, because Itsuki, Chitose, and Yuuta all laughed
        <p></p>like something was hilarious. Amane stared in the opposite direction, biting his lip and
        <p></p>feeling extremely embarrassed.
        <p></p>Mahiru must have gotten free just at that moment. She locked eyes with him and
        <p></p>smiled.
        <p></p>Amane groaned, feeling even more embarrassed now that Mahiru had looked at him,
        <p></p>but she calmly walked over, wearing a smile on her face.
        <p></p>"Looks like you're having fun over here," she said. "What were you talking about?"
        <p></p>"Hmm? We were talking about how cute Amane is!"
        <p></p>"Watch it, Chitose—"
        <p></p>"That is what we were talking about, right?"
        <p></p>"Basically, they were all teasing me."
        <p></p>"Oh yeah, that too."
        <p></p>"See?! She admits it."
        <p></p>Amane shot Chitose a pointed look to tell her to cut it out, but Chitose seemed totally
        <p></p>indifferent. Instead, he glared at Itsuki, who was supposed to be in charge of
        <p></p>controlling her.
        <p></p>"Why are you glaring at me?"
        <p></p>"Maybe because you're the one who started all this in the first place?"
        <p></p>"So… what were you talking about, then?" Mahiru asked again.
        <p></p>"Oh, just the fact that Amane's a pure, innocent, devoted boy…," Chitose murmured.
        <p></p>Amane really wished she would shut up already.
        <p></p>"I don't know what all this nonsense about being 'pure' or whatever is." He scowled.
        <p></p>"What do you even mean, anyway? What's so pure about me?"
        <p></p>Itsuki put on a dramatic expression of exaggerated surprise. "Oh, don't tell me you
        <p></p>weren't aware…?"
        <p></p>Amane kicked his friend under the desk and glanced over at Mahiru. She was looking
        <p></p>upward slightly, with her usual smile on, as if she was pondering something.
        <p></p>"Actually, we were talking about how Fujimiya is rather stoic. I guess calling him
        <p></p>straightforward would be more accurate," Yuuta added.
        <p></p>"I see." Mahiru nodded. "Fujimiya is definitely the type to work hard once he sets his
        <p></p>mind to something. In that sense, he's a very straightforward person, isn't he? I think
        <p></p>that's a wonderful quality to have."
        <p></p>"It really is. I just wish that he would have some more confidence about it."
        <p></p>"That's very true," she agreed.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't stand being there a second longer listening to the two of them mock
        <p></p>him with their excessive praise.
        <p></p>He made eye contact with Mahiru, who gave him a gentle smile.
        <p></p>He felt embarrassed and immediately averted his eyes and saw that the rest of their
        <p></p>classmates were looking over enviously.
        <p></p>Their attention was not focused on him, but on Mahiru and Yuuta, who somehow
        <p></p>seemed to be hitting it off talking about Amane. That was a relief, but it brought up
        <p></p>some slightly complicated feelings.
        <p></p>Seeing the two most popular people chattering away and getting along with each other
        <p></p>would naturally attract attention. Amane felt a slight tinge of jealousy himself at the
        <p></p>fact that neither of the two seemed to be the least bit bothered by everyone looking at
        <p></p>them.
        <p></p>"What's wrong, Amane?" Chitose asked. "You're blushing…"
        <p></p>"I am not."
        <p></p>"You are too! And you're trying to hide it. Oh, Mahiru? After school, let's go have fun
        <p></p>somewhere, all five of us. We're all together already, and the tests are over, so let's
        <p></p>party!"
        <p></p>Completely ignoring Amane's uncooperative attitude, Chitose pivoted to Mahiru with
        <p></p>a suggestion. It was a casual invitation, without too much pressure, but with her usual
        <p></p>angelic smile still on her face, Mahiru answered, "Of course, if everyone wants to."
        <p></p>"The five of us" must have included Amane, too, but he probably didn't have the right
        <p></p>to veto the plan, and Chitose must have understood that he wasn't likely to reject it
        <p></p>anyway.
        <p></p>Chitose was wearing an expression that said, "I got you!"
        <p></p>Amane looked away again as he nodded his assent.

        <p></p>Chapter 47: A Reward from the Angel 
        <p></p>"Hey, Amane, don't you think you tried too hard this time?" Itsuki grumbled, sounding
        <p></p>somewhat astonished as he stared at the exam rankings that had been posted on the
        <p></p>bulletin board in the hallway.
        <p></p>Even after their group study session, Amane had continued working diligently,
        <p></p>preparing for the exams. He'd wanted to be proud of himself for a change. Also, the
        <p></p>studying had helped distract him from certain coquettish words that had been
        <p></p>whispered in his ear.
        <p></p>They were looking at the result of his efforts—and all the work he'd done to keep his
        <p></p>mind off her suggestive expressions and the words that she had uttered—which had
        <p></p>led him to rank sixth in their grade this time.
        <p></p>"Wow, it's hard to believe I made it that far."
        <p></p>"You really worked for it. Proud of yourself?"
        <p></p>"…Pretty proud, I guess. But there's no guarantee that I'll be able to do it again."
        <p></p>"What a stoic guy…"
        <p></p>He didn't want Mahiru to see him climb so high only to fall back down out of
        <p></p>negligence. There would be no point to it unless he could consistently place in the
        <p></p>upper ranks.
        <p></p>Considering that college entrance exams were also coming up, it would be absurd to
        <p></p>be satisfied with this one success and give up trying.
        <p></p>Hasty preparations would not be enough for the entrance exams since students from
        <p></p>other schools would also be vying for spots, so Amane vowed to keep studying hard
        <p></p>so that he would be ready for what was to come as well.
        <p></p>Incidentally, Mahiru had placed far ahead of anyone else, in the top spot again. This
        <p></p>was nothing if not expected, but Amane knew that it was because of how hard she
        <p></p>worked, and that she never took it for granted.
        <p></p>"It looks like you took sixth place this time, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>Mahiru, who had arrived to look at the bulletin board after Amane and Itsuki, smiled
        <p></p>beautifully as she noticed Amane's name.
        <p></p>She was in angel mode, and Amane smiled casually back at her, trying not to let any of
        <p></p>his inner turmoil show on his face.
        <p></p>He felt the prickle of people's eyes on him, but he was already getting used to talking
        <p></p>with Mahiru in public. The stares still made him uncomfortable, but he was able to
        <p></p>soldier through without too much distress.
        <p></p>"Looks that way." Amane nodded. "Good for me, I guess."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, he really worked hard, ya know," Itsuki interjected. "Studying during breaks
        <p></p>and everything."
        <p></p>"…Ah, well—"
        <p></p>"If you worked that hard, shouldn't you give yourself a reward?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"I… guess so."
        <p></p>Recalling the reward that Mahiru had promised him caused Amane to experience an
        <p></p>indescribable surge of emotion.
        <p></p>She had promised to let him lie in her lap and to clean his ears. He had done so much
        <p></p>to erase the thought from his mind that he had genuinely forgotten about it, but she'd
        <p></p>said she would do it if he made it into the top ten.
        <p></p>He could always decline, but… there was no way he could bring himself to reject such
        <p></p>an opportunity, if the girl he liked wanted to pamper him like that.
        <p></p>"…Speaking of which, congratulations on the top spot. Shouldn't you be the one
        <p></p>treating yourself?"
        <p></p>"I suppose so. But it's not good to pamper oneself too much."
        <p></p>"But you're already so strict with yourself that I think you could stand to be a little
        <p></p>indulgent. Well, that's not for me to say, though."
        <p></p>Now that they were on the subject, Amane realized that he would be receiving
        <p></p>something special from Mahiru, but he had nothing to give back, and he wondered
        <p></p>what he should do.
        <p></p>On the other hand, he had no idea what he could offer her, so he would have to ask
        <p></p>about it after they got home.
        <p></p>Looking at Mahiru wearing her angelic smile, Itsuki quietly whispered to Amane,
        <p></p>"How about you reward her?"
        <p></p>Amane didn't need to be told twice, and he made a mental note to ask her about it
        <p></p>when they got home.
        <p></p>"Huh? A reward for me?"
        <p></p>When Amane posed the question to Mahiru as she was preparing dinner at home with
        <p></p>her apron on, she turned around with a puzzled expression on her face.
        <p></p>Amane hadn't been able to settle down, remembering the devilish smile she'd put on
        <p></p>the other day and thinking about the reward that was probably waiting for him after
        <p></p>dinner. But Mahiru hadn't seemed to notice, and now her expression showed that his
        <p></p>question was entirely unexpected.
        <p></p>"There's not really anything specific that I want, but…"
        <p></p>"Or something you want me to do…?"
        <p></p>"You do for me? Hmm, let me think. I guess I'd like you to cut that cucumber thinly
        <p></p>with the slicer."
        <p></p>"That's not what I mean… Well, if there isn't anything, you don't have to force yourself
        <p></p>to answer, you know."
        <p></p>Amane had a feeling she wasn't taking his question seriously, but he didn't want to
        <p></p>push too hard, so he backed down easily.
        <p></p>If Mahiru really didn't need anything, that was fine, but if there was something she'd
        <p></p>like him to do, and it was within Amane's capabilities, he intended to grant her
        <p></p>request.
        <p></p>For the time being, she'd said she wanted him to feed the cucumber into the slicer, so
        <p></p>he washed his hands and cut it thinly, but this was just helping her out rather than a
        <p></p>reward.
        <p></p>"Rub some salt on that and set it aside."
        <p></p>"Yes, ma'am… Is there really nothing more?"
        <p></p>"Not really. I'm content with how things are at the moment… And anyway, I think that
        <p></p>I'll be able to fulfill my one wish by myself."
        <p></p>"The wish you really want granted?"
        <p></p>"What do you think that is?"
        <p></p>Amane looked up from the slicer and saw Mahiru smiling gently.
        <p></p>For a second, her expression looked like the devilish grin she had worn the other day,
        <p></p>and he couldn't bear to look directly at her, so he dropped his eyes back down to the
        <p></p>countertop.
        <p></p>"…I d-don't know."
        <p></p>"Exactly. So don't worry about it. I'm happy as is."
        <p></p>Amane could sense the smile in her voice.
        <p></p>Mahiru went back to cooking, giving off an air like she wasn't going to let Amane
        <p></p>investigate any further. Amane didn't know what to do, so he just kept on thinly slicing
        <p></p>the cucumber.
        <p></p>"All right, lie down, Amane."
        <p></p>After dinner was over, the dreaded reward time arrived.
        <p></p>As if it was the most natural thing in the world, Mahiru sat down on one side of the
        <p></p>sofa and smiled at him as she patted her knees. Amane was at a loss for words.
        <p></p>Mahiru's outfit for the day was shorts with black tights, so he would technically be
        <p></p>lying in her clothed lap, but only an incredibly thin layer of fabric separated him from
        <p></p>her skin.
        <p></p>To make matters worse, she had taken a bath after getting home today, and her whole
        <p></p>body smelled wonderful.
        <p></p>It would be suicide for Amane to lie in her lap in such a risky situation.
        <p></p>"…No, um—"
        <p></p>"You don't have to if you don't want to, but isn't this what you asked for?"
        <p></p>"I-it is what I wished for, but the thing is, now that it's actually happening, I'm nervous,
        <p></p>like… i-it's embarrassing, you know?"
        <p></p>"Well then, why did you ask for it?"
        <p></p>"Th-that must have been male instincts or something."
        <p></p>"Well, you can follow those male instincts, it's fine, but… this is your reward for
        <p></p>working so hard. You don't need to be shy, okay? I'm going to spoil you a lot."
        <p></p>Mahiru patted her lap again, and Amane gulped.
        <p></p>It had gotten quite warm lately, so her tights were thinner than before.
        <p></p>He could just barely see the color of her skin through the sheer material, and it stirred
        <p></p>up some strong emotions.
        <p></p>Even if her thighs were covered by the tights, the smooth beauty of her slender legs
        <p></p>was on display, luring Amane in.
        <p></p>It probably wasn't Mahiru's intention at all, but the way she was dressed that day was
        <p></p>going to be the death of him.
        <p></p>Rightfully, he should have somehow found a way to decline her offer and devise a
        <p></p>peaceful way out for his heart and soul, but under the pretext of a reward, Amane's
        <p></p>"male instincts" had gotten him into this mess.
        <p></p>Gingerly, he sat down beside Mahiru and lowered his head onto her lap.
        <p></p>He had experienced this once before, and just as he remembered, her legs were very
        <p></p>soft. Since the fabric separating him from her was even thinner than it had been last
        <p></p>time, the texture and warmth of her skin came through clearly, and Amane felt his
        <p></p>heart squeeze tightly.
        <p></p>He wasn't sure where to look, so he faced upward for the time being and saw Mahiru
        <p></p>smiling down at him.
        <p></p>His view of her face, however, was partially obscured by something… or, rather, two
        <p></p>somethings. It was only May, but the temperature had been rising, and the shirt that
        <p></p>Mahiru was wearing was also quite thin. On top of that, the material followed the lines
        <p></p>of her body closely, highlighting her shapely figure beneath the fine cloth.
        <p></p>Amane had to turn over. If he stayed like that, he was going to explode from shame.
        <p></p>"All right, I'm going to clean your ears now."
        <p></p>Completely unaware of Amane's inner distress, Mahiru announced this with a smile.
        <p></p>She sounded somewhat excited. Mahiru reached for the ear pick and tissues that were
        <p></p>sitting on the table, and something soft pressed down on the side of his head.
        <p></p>(?!)
        <p></p>Sirens blared in Amane's mind, but Mahiru didn't seem to notice. She quickly grabbed
        <p></p>the ear pick and sat back up. Amane's heart was pounding as he felt the weight of her
        <p></p>soft body. Mentally, he was no longer prepared to handle an ear cleaning.
        <p></p>"Now, hold still," Mahiru whispered in a soothing voice, and she gently fixed his head
        <p></p>in place with one hand.
        <p></p>She reminded him not to move while she was cleaning his ears, but Amane found it
        <p></p>very difficult to stay still, for several reasons.
        <p></p>Even so, there was no way that he was going to struggle against her, so he stayed
        <p></p>obediently still and stared hard at the side of the table as something rigid was slowly
        <p></p>inserted into his ear hole.
        <p></p>He got chills for a moment. He was more sensitive where his skin was thinner. Amane
        <p></p>never felt ticklish when he cleaned his own ears, but when Mahiru was doing it, he got
        <p></p>a strange feeling, probably because he wasn't in control… and because it was exciting
        <p></p>to know that it was the girl he loved who was doing it.
        <p></p>He knew that Mahiru was going to do a careful job because of her personality, but
        <p></p>somehow having her oh-so-gently clean out his ear was kind of ticklish.
        <p></p>It was a little too tingly to really be pleasant, but at the same time, it had an unusual
        <p></p>appeal that ignited certain desires.
        <p></p>At the very least, there was an indescribable niceness to it, pleasant enough that he
        <p></p>was not going to resist having his ears cleaned like this.
        <p></p>"It doesn't hurt, does it?" Mahiru asked.
        <p></p>"Mm… it doesn't hurt. It feels good."
        <p></p>"Oh really? I'm glad. I've heard that this is supposed to be romantic for guys, but… well,
        <p></p>does this feel romantic for you?"
        <p></p>"…A little, I guess."
        <p></p>"Well, you are a guy, after all."
        <p></p>"Have I given you any reason to doubt it?"
        <p></p>If Amane wasn't a guy, he wouldn't be writhing in agony on the inside, and he wouldn't
        <p></p>be so excited by the softness of her skin. As it was, he couldn't help getting flustered
        <p></p>being held close and pampered by the person he loved.
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, it's because you're such a gentleman, Amane. I didn't think you had much
        <p></p>interest."
        <p></p>"On the assumption that I am a gentleman, what I want and what I do are very
        <p></p>different. You ought to be careful; there are men who will smile to your face, then
        <p></p>attack you when you're alone."
        <p></p>"By that logic, you wouldn't really be a man then, would you?"
        <p></p>Amane felt like he had just been called out and bit his lip unhappily. That said, it didn't
        <p></p>seem like Mahiru had meant it as an insult. She continued peacefully with her cleaning.
        <p></p>"Here, Amane, turn over. I want to do the other side."
        <p></p>Even as he frowned harder, Amane turned and presented the opposite ear. Facing her
        <p></p>belly, however, was a new kind of penance. If he looked down, he would see her shorts,
        <p></p>and that wouldn't be good, so he had no option but to stare docilely at her stomach.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure if this was heaven or hell.
        <p></p>It would probably be heavenly if he could be honest about his desires, but as long as
        <p></p>he was stuck between what he wanted and what he knew was right, it was like he was
        <p></p>plunging one foot right into hell.
        <p></p>"…Amane, you've been kind of trembling since we started, but…"
        <p></p>"Please don't pay any attention to that."
        <p></p>There was no way he could even begin to tell her what he was feeling inside. After all,
        <p></p>if he said any of it out loud, Mahiru would definitely pull away from him.
        <p></p>So there was nothing to be done but obediently accept the ear cleaning and hide his
        <p></p>desires at all costs. This angel, pampering him innocently with no ulterior motives,
        <p></p>was a frightening creature.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to have some questions about Amane's behavior, but he was facing her
        <p></p>and couldn't make eye contact, so she gave up on investigating further and went back
        <p></p>to cleaning his ear.
        <p></p>Feeling an inexpressible pleasantness and a ticklish sensation, Amane closed his eyes
        <p></p>and waited for it to be over.
        <p></p>Whenever he opened his eyes, he felt slightly guilty about what was happening, so he
        <p></p>kept them shut. But without his vision, his other senses seemed to become more acute.
        <p></p>He inhaled her sweet smell, as well as the scents of her shampoo and body wash, and
        <p></p>he felt the softness of her thighs. He was beside himself.
        <p></p>He couldn't stop thinking about how amazing it would be if he could have his fill of
        <p></p>these sensations without holding back.
        <p></p>"Amane, when I'm done with your ears, can I play with your hair?"
        <p></p>"…If you want."
        <p></p>If he escaped soon, he wouldn't have to experience this conflict any longer. However,
        <p></p>Amane was still a guy, and if a girl was going to let him continue lying in her lap, he
        <p></p>wasn't going to argue. Even as he felt conflicted over wanting her to stop and wanting
        <p></p>her to do more, in the end, he gave in to his desires. It made him realize that in many
        <p></p>ways, he was very weak willed.
        <p></p>Mahiru gave every indication of being pleased by Amane's consent.
        <p></p>"I'm almost finished, okay?" she said as she carefully scraped out his ear.
        <p></p>Ah, over already? Amane thought, feeling just a little bit disappointed, suffering lonely
        <p></p>agony yet again.
        <p></p>But he didn't let it show on his face or in his movements.
        <p></p>The slightly ticklish yet pleasant feeling came to an end as Mahiru pulled out the ear
        <p></p>cleaning tool.
        <p></p>In its place came a different lovely sensation as Mahiru's fingers slipped smoothly
        <p></p>through his hair.
        <p></p>"All right, all done."
        <p></p>Mahiru combed through his hair with gentle hands as if she was comforting a child,
        <p></p>and Amane simultaneously felt embarrassed and like he wanted to surrender himself
        <p></p>to her entirely.
        <p></p>He knew that if it came down to it, the latter feeling was stronger, and a silent groan
        <p></p>threatened to escape his lips.
        <p></p>Mahiru's intention had been to pamper him thoroughly as a reward, and he was
        <p></p>definitely getting spoiled.
        <p></p>Part of him wanted to fight against Mahiru, who seemed to be enjoying her chance to
        <p></p>indulge Amane just as she had promised. Though it felt so good that any willpower he
        <p></p>had was uprooted entirely, leaving him utterly helpless to resist.
        <p></p>…I'm getting spoiled…
        <p></p>He was getting his head caressed by her tender hands while fully savoring her
        <p></p>feminine scent and warmth. It didn't sound like such a big deal when he put it into
        <p></p>words, but it felt incredibly good and left him practically euphoric. Amane could
        <p></p>imagine losing himself if he were allowed to enjoy these kinds of pleasures every day.
        <p></p>The thought had a certain appeal to it.
        <p></p>When Amane let out a sigh and relaxed his muscles, he heard a quiet giggle.
        <p></p>"You're like a pampered little boy, for once," Mahiru softly teased.
        <p></p>"…Whose fault is that?"
        <p></p>"My fault." Mahiru giggled sweetly and swept her fingers through his hair again. "I
        <p></p>always want to dote on you, because I want an excuse to touch you. Your hair feels so
        <p></p>nice to brush."
        <p></p>"…Really?"
        <p></p>"Yes. It's smooth and glossy. How do you get your hair to do that…?"
        <p></p>"…I just use the shampoo my mom recommended."
        <p></p>Shihoko had been very insistent about making sure he didn't neglect and damage his
        <p></p>fine hair. Subsequently, Amane used shampoo and conditioner found in beauty salons,
        <p></p>the kind that boasted about being good for your lustrous locks. He didn't hate the scent
        <p></p>of it, and he liked the feeling when he ran his fingers through his hair after it dried, so
        <p></p>he kept using the product.
        <p></p>"You should talk, your hair is super smooth, Mahiru."
        <p></p>He gathered a tuft of the flaxen strands into his hand, and it felt even softer and
        <p></p>smoother than his.
        <p></p>Of course, the girl had silkier, glossier hair; Amane's couldn't compete. Mahiru's had a
        <p></p>texture that made him want to touch it forever, and it had a clean, soapy scent that
        <p></p>wasn't overly strong. It was irresistible.
        <p></p>"I think this every time I pat your head, but you must take a lot of care in looking after
        <p></p>your hair."
        <p></p>"…Well, I've never been negligent about it."
        <p></p>"I can tell. By the way, I've been touching your head whenever I like, but… is that all
        <p></p>right? They say that a woman's hair is her life, and all that."
        <p></p>"…I like it when you touch me, Amane."
        <p></p>Amane was glad that she couldn't see his face, because he was sure his expression
        <p></p>contorted into something strange when Mahiru said those words.
        <p></p>Shame, delight, confusion, panic… If Mahiru had seen all those strong emotions
        <p></p>written on his face, she probably would have started to distrust him.
        <p></p>I get carried away because she says things like that.
        <p></p>Unable to say anything out loud, Amane tried to return to his normal expression. He
        <p></p>closed his eyes and sighed.
        <p></p>When he opened his eyes, Mahiru's shirt was right in front of him.
        <p></p>Apparently, he had fallen asleep again—his consciousness had drifted away on a
        <p></p>cushion of comfort and joy. Though he had no idea how long he'd slept, and that made
        <p></p>him anxious.
        <p></p>The hand combing his hair had stopped.
        <p></p>He sat up timidly and saw that Mahiru was leaning back against the sofa, breathing
        <p></p>heavily in her sleep.
        <p></p>"Defenseless," Amane mumbled at Mahiru, whose gentle breaths were rhythmically
        <p></p>rising and falling, then checked the clock and felt his cheek twitch.
        <p></p>It was an hour before midnight. He had been lying in Mahiru's lap since nine, after they
        <p></p>had finished cleaning up dinner and doing other household chores. Which meant that
        <p></p>he had been in the same position for almost two hours straight.
        <p></p>Mahiru had probably fallen asleep after being stuck on the couch for so long. Amane
        <p></p>knew that she wouldn't have been able to bring herself to move and disturb him, so
        <p></p>she had just nodded off where she sat.
        <p></p>He thought she ought to be more vigilant, since she was in a guy's apartment, but he
        <p></p>was the one who'd fallen asleep in her lap in the first place, so he bore some
        <p></p>responsibility.
        <p></p>He gazed at Mahiru's sleeping face, wondering what he should do, and decided for the
        <p></p>time being to go ahead and take a bath.
        <p></p>Mahiru had already taken hers for the evening, but Amane hadn't taken his yet. Even
        <p></p>if he was going to wake her up, it was better to let her sleep for now and get his bath
        <p></p>out of the way. There was also the possibility that Mahiru would wake up on her own
        <p></p>while he was bathing.
        <p></p>With that decided, Amane hurriedly went back to his room to get a change of clothes.
        <p></p>Once Amane finished his bath, he checked the living room and sighed softly.
        <p></p>As before, Mahiru was completely submerged in the depths of sleep and hadn't stirred,
        <p></p>even with the noise from the hair dryer.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, wake up," Amane said, and gently shook her the shoulder. She was still fast
        <p></p>asleep. Her head slumped to the side, showing she was truly unconscious, so for the
        <p></p>time being, Amane propped her back up.
        <p></p>He figured it must have been tiring, sitting there with his head in her lap for so long,
        <p></p>and she had probably nodded off. For now, it was clear that she wouldn't wake up any
        <p></p>time soon.
        <p></p>I feel like this happened last time, too…
        <p></p>It must have been around the end of last year. He remembered lending Mahiru his own
        <p></p>bed after she inadvertently fell asleep.
        <p></p>Amane had a feeling they were headed down the same path this time as well.
        <p></p>He shook her again, more forcefully, and called her name, but she didn't wake up.
        <p></p>He heard a quiet, little groan, but it was more like a snore than words.
        <p></p>This wasn't the first time that Amane had seen Mahiru asleep and defenseless, and he
        <p></p>couldn't help but wonder, again, whether it was all right for her to have this much faith
        <p></p>in him.
        <p></p>Cursing his luck, Amane poked Mahiru's cheek, but she didn't stir. He was only met
        <p></p>with the feeling of her smooth and soft skin. His thumb traced a path down her cheek,
        <p></p>stroking it gently.
        <p></p>When he reached her slightly slack lips, he found the texture to be even softer and
        <p></p>more supple. They reminded him of ripe fruit and looked like they would taste sweet.
        <p></p>It wouldn't have been impossible for him to taste that sweetness in that moment,
        <p></p>when she was this vulnerable. He could have enjoyed that delicious fruit and savored
        <p></p>it as he pleased.
        <p></p>But Amane's self-control, and the knowledge that he would never recover if Mahiru
        <p></p>rejected him, kept him back. Yet he couldn't stop touching her altogether. Amane
        <p></p>laughed at himself for being such a coward, and he stared at Mahiru, whose beautiful
        <p></p>sleeping face was so generously exposed.
        <p></p>She doesn't even know how I feel…
        <p></p>Mahiru probably had no idea how anxious he got when she was overly careless like
        <p></p>this.
        <p></p>Unconsciously, Amane let out a huge sigh, gently stroked Mahiru's defenseless,
        <p></p>sleeping face, and chuckled quietly.
        <p></p>Amane felt like he was being a shameful wimp, even more than usual. On the other
        <p></p>hand, he was also convinced that his cowardice was what had allowed him to win
        <p></p>Mahiru's trust.
        <p></p>It occurred to him that if he had gained her trust to this degree, he might be on the
        <p></p>way to getting her to like him.
        <p></p>Even if he wanted to confess his feelings, he was too much of a weakling, too anxious
        <p></p>about opening up to her.
        <p></p>"…If I could simply tell you I love you, I wouldn't have any worries," he grumbled
        <p></p>quietly.
        <p></p>With the pad of his thumb, Amane gently stroked her tender lips and sighed.
        <p></p>The fact that the girl he loved trusted him this much and was here in this vulnerable
        <p></p>state felt gratifying and lovely, but it was also torture. Before long, he was going to have
        <p></p>to get her to understand the conflict he was feeling.
        <p></p>He made up his mind to scold her a little bit when she woke up, then grabbed her by
        <p></p>the shoulders and shook her.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, wake up. It's time to go home."
        <p></p>He shook her kind of hard, to prompt her to wake up.
        <p></p>He could have stared at her adorable sleeping face forever, but if he looked too long,
        <p></p>he was going to want to do something, and he wouldn't be able to sleep with her here
        <p></p>anyway.
        <p></p>He had reluctantly allowed her to stay over several times before, or maybe it would be
        <p></p>more accurate to say he had lent her his bed. He knew that, as a last resort, he could
        <p></p>let her sleep in his room.
        <p></p>If possible, he wanted her to return to her own apartment. If Mahiru slept in Amane's
        <p></p>bed, it would smell extremely sweet and nice, and that would cause him all sorts of
        <p></p>difficulties until her scent faded, and he wanted to avoid that if he could.
        <p></p>With that one goal, Amane shook Mahiru and gently slapped her soft cheeks. With
        <p></p>extremely sluggish movements, she raised her eyelids with a flutter of her long
        <p></p>eyelashes.
        <p></p>However, the vibrant caramel-colored eyes that peeked out from behind them seemed
        <p></p>somewhat vacant and unfocused. He couldn't tell where she was looking, and her
        <p></p>bleary eyes started to slip listlessly back behind the curtain of her eyelids.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, I'm begging you, please wake up. Go sleep at home."
        <p></p>"…Unh…"
        <p></p>"Don't groan, just say yes."
        <p></p>"…Yes…"
        <p></p>She answered him in a mumbling voice that didn't sound like she understood the
        <p></p>situation, so with his cheek twitching, Amane tried even harder to rouse her back to
        <p></p>consciousness, shaking her harder but not so hard as to rattle her brain.
        <p></p>It must have had some effect, because Mahiru showed him her eyes again, but—this
        <p></p>time, she fell forward, directly against Amane, and buried her face in his chest.
        <p></p>In a quiet, muffled voice, she mumbled, "Smells nice," as she rubbed her cheek against
        <p></p>him. A small sound squeaked out from the back of Amane's throat when he heard her
        <p></p>moaning.
        <p></p>Seriously, this girl is…
        <p></p>He tried to tear himself away from her slack body, so defenseless that he had to
        <p></p>wonder if she wasn't doing it on purpose at this point, but he couldn't. At the same
        <p></p>time, he felt the urge to stay just as he was, to wrap his arms around her and dote on
        <p></p>her. It probably would have been best to immediately pull away and go bang his head
        <p></p>on the wall.
        <p></p>Biting his lip hard, Amane grabbed Mahiru's shoulders and slowly pushed her away
        <p></p>from his body, and she looked up at him blankly, with dazed, spiritless eyes.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, it's late already; how about you go home? We've got school tomorrow, you
        <p></p>know, so if you oversleep, you'll have a hard time. I'll walk you to your door."
        <p></p>Mahiru only lived next door, but she was definitely out of it, so he felt anxious about
        <p></p>her leaving the apartment.
        <p></p>Whether Mahiru had understood him or not, she said, "Good niii…" in a lifeless voice
        <p></p>and staggered to her feet, which was a good sign. She looked like she might fall right
        <p></p>back down on the floor, so Amane ended up rushing over to support her.
        <p></p>She was wiped out from the tests, and on top of that, she had let him lie in her lap for
        <p></p>a long time. Sitting still for so long must have been physically taxing. Sleepiness was
        <p></p>bearing down on her, and she could hardly stand.
        <p></p>…No way around it.
        <p></p>Amane was sure that even if he lent her his shoulder and somehow got her as far as
        <p></p>her door, she would still fall flat on her face the second she walked in.
        <p></p>He sighed softly and gazed into Mahiru's face as she leaned her full weight on him.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, you've reached your limit, so I'm going to take you to your room. Can I borrow
        <p></p>your keys? I'm going with you into your apartment."
        <p></p>He felt nervous about going into a girl's apartment and didn't like having to ask Mahiru
        <p></p>for permission when she was obviously passed out. However, he figured that if she had
        <p></p>to choose between that and staying over in a boy's apartment, she would probably
        <p></p>prefer the former, no matter how many times she had done the latter already. Amane
        <p></p>also knew he would be able to relax and sleep better if Mahiru was at home tucked
        <p></p>into her own bed, instead of his.
        <p></p>He had roused Mahiru enough to ask for her permission, which slightly eased his
        <p></p>discomfort.
        <p></p>In response to his question, Mahiru slowly nodded her head.
        <p></p>After confirming her consent, Amane pulled the keys out of Mahiru's pocket, trying
        <p></p>his best not to make contact with her hip while he did so, and cradled her in his arms.
        <p></p>Mahiru must have been very tired, because she leaned into him and fell half asleep
        <p></p>again. If Amane didn't get her back home soon, she was going to fall asleep right in his
        <p></p>arms.
        <p></p>He stepped out of his apartment, trying his best not to make much noise. He walked
        <p></p>over to Mahiru's door and, still holding her, carefully unlocked it. Then he slowly
        <p></p>carried her into the apartment.
        <p></p>"…Pardon the intrusion."
        <p></p>The interior was, of course, laid out the same way as his. Amane knew it had the same
        <p></p>floor plan, so he also knew where the bedroom ought to be.
        <p></p>But his heart started pounding the second he stepped in. Mahiru's apartment had a
        <p></p>sweet, invigorating smell, and it was decorated differently from his. Her meticulous
        <p></p>and tidy personality was evident. The flooring was polished to a high shine, and he
        <p></p>couldn't spot any dirt worth mentioning. There was a mirror and some flowers sitting
        <p></p>on the shoe cubby that stood against the wall, which gave the place a subdued, yet
        <p></p>bright and brilliant atmosphere.
        <p></p>Amane glanced into the living room beyond the entryway. He got the impression that
        <p></p>an adult had decorated it, with a collection of clean and cheerful furniture in basic
        <p></p>tones of soft white and pale blue to go with the natural colors of the wood floor.
        <p></p>Despite that, the apartment didn't really look like anyone lived in it. It showed hardly
        <p></p>any signs of habitation. Besides sleeping and going to school, Mahiru had recently
        <p></p>been spending most of her time over at Amane's apartment, so in a certain sense, it
        <p></p>was almost like she wasn't living there.
        <p></p>After having that realization, Amane quietly opened the door to the room he assumed
        <p></p>was her bedroom and stepped inside.
        <p></p>It was the first time in his life that he had been inside a girl's bedroom. It was such a
        <p></p>lovely space that Amane thought other girls would get upset if they had to live up to
        <p></p>this standard.
        <p></p>Just like the living room, the basic colors were white and light blue, but it was fancier
        <p></p>than the living room. He would best describe it as tidy and stylish.
        <p></p>Amane also thought that it looked more lived-in and showcased Mahiru's personality
        <p></p>more. The place was well-kept, as was Mahiru's habit. On top of the desk, next to her
        <p></p>textbooks and cookbooks, sat the stuffed animal that she had won at the game center
        <p></p>when Amane had taken her there.
        <p></p>Also, the stuffed bear that he had gifted her for her last birthday was there, just as
        <p></p>immaculate as on the day he'd given it. It was sitting beside her pillow on the bed, and
        <p></p>it now had a navy-blue ribbon tied inconspicuously around it, mostly concealed by the
        <p></p>original ribbon that had always been there.
        <p></p>Amane had heard that she treasured the stuffed bear, but seeing in person that she
        <p></p>had it sitting there by her pillow, he felt his cheeks grow hot.
        <p></p>Imagining her sleeping with it every night was almost too much to stand.
        <p></p>Biting the inside of his cheek in a desperate attempt to keep it together, Amane slowly
        <p></p>lowered Mahiru onto the bed and covered her with the blanket. He was once again
        <p></p>grateful that she had worn shorts with tights today.
        <p></p>Maybe because she felt the sensation of her body sinking into the bed, Mahiru, who
        <p></p>had been almost entirely asleep, opened her bleary eyes a little.
        <p></p>Smiling in spite of himself at her sleepy expression, Amane got down on his knees and
        <p></p>gently stroked Mahiru's head with the palm of his hand.
        <p></p>"You're home now. I'll give your key back later, so don't worry about that."
        <p></p>She had touched him plenty that day, so he figured it would be all right to touch her a
        <p></p>little bit, too. As he scooped up a piece of hair that had fallen across her face to move
        <p></p>it out of the way, he poked at her supple cheek, and she giggled like it tickled and put
        <p></p>on a smile that was several times softer than usual.
        <p></p>Without pause, with sleepy, bleary eyes, she patted the bed beside her.
        <p></p>"…You too, Amane…"
        <p></p>He froze as he considered what the rest of that sentence could mean.
        <p></p>She seemed to be telling him to sleep there. Maybe even that she wanted him as a body
        <p></p>pillow.
        <p></p>…She doesn't mean that; she doesn't know what she's saying.
        <p></p>Amane tried to persuade himself of this as he pushed back against certain desires that
        <p></p>had momentarily threatened to lure him astray.
        <p></p>He was afraid that if he lingered, Mahiru would say something unthinkable, so he
        <p></p>impatiently stroked her head very gently, like he was putting a child to bed, and lulled
        <p></p>her to sleep.
        <p></p>"I'm going home now. Okay?"
        <p></p>"…No."
        <p></p>"There's no way I'm hanging around in a girl's bedroom. You'll absolutely regret asking
        <p></p>once you wake up. I can already see you beating me with your pillow."
        <p></p>If Amane joined her in bed, not only would he be unable to get a wink of sleep, but
        <p></p>once she woke up, Mahiru would be confused and would turn bright red. Then, to hide
        <p></p>her embarrassment, she was almost guaranteed to whack him with her pillow.
        <p></p>He could also anticipate that afterward, things would get awkward between them, so
        <p></p>for the sake of Amane's sanity and the next day's mood, he had to use all his willpower
        <p></p>to get out of there.
        <p></p>Mahiru was still dozing off, but seemed to be resisting sleep and Amane's frantic
        <p></p>attempts to pacify her.
        <p></p>In that case—Amane grabbed the bear from beside her and pushed it against her face.
        <p></p>"This guy says he'll sleep here instead of me, so relax and go to bed."
        <p></p>It appeared she had been keeping the stuffed animal close when she slept, so Amane
        <p></p>decided to use it to lull her to sleep.
        <p></p>He untangled his fingers from her soft hair and gently, gently whispered good night.
        <p></p>Mahiru groaned in an adorable voice and embraced the stuffed bear in front of her.
        <p></p>She looked innocent and childlike, a far cry from her usual prim and proper act, and
        <p></p>so sweet that he wanted to caress her again.
        <p></p>She was so charming that he might have spontaneously snapped a picture, if he'd had
        <p></p>his smartphone on hand, and he felt relieved that he hadn't brought anything with him
        <p></p>other than the key to his apartment. It would be very inappropriate to photograph a
        <p></p>sleeping girl's face. He knew it was weird to even consider it.
        <p></p>At last, Mahiru's eyelids, rimmed with long eyelashes, covered the entirety of her
        <p></p>eyeballs, and she started breathing peacefully in her sleep.
        <p></p>Amane sighed quietly, careful not to wake her again.
        <p></p>…She's too careless. That was terrifying.
        <p></p>Amane knew that she only behaved this way because she was with him. That didn't
        <p></p>change the fact that it was difficult for him to watch the girl he loved let her guard
        <p></p>down so completely like that.
        <p></p>Praising himself for resisting temptation, Amane left Mahiru's room as silently as he
        <p></p>could and walked right out of her apartment.
        <p></p>He knew that it would take quite a bit of time before he was able to sleep that night.
        <p></p>"G-good morning…"
        <p></p>"M-morning…"
        <p></p>Inevitably, the next day, the two of them each felt too awkward to look at the other.
        <p></p>Mahiru almost never came to his apartment this early, but naturally, given what had
        <p></p>happened, she had come over to talk.
        <p></p>Amane had had difficulty falling asleep after everything that had happened yesterday,
        <p></p>and it didn't make it any easier when she suddenly appeared first thing in the morning.
        <p></p>He recalled the pleasant sensation of lying in her lap, the rich fruity scent, and the full
        <p></p>softness that had come down on his head in the middle of it. Then the memory of
        <p></p>Mahiru's apartment, which he had basically entered on his own, with permission at
        <p></p>least, surfaced in his mind. Her cherubic sleeping face and sweet pleading voice were
        <p></p>impossible to forget.
        <p></p>He had spent the night tossing and turning in bed, tortured by how lovely she had
        <p></p>looked while hugging the teddy bear.
        <p></p>Writhing in agony, he had just finally managed to go to sleep when morning arrived,
        <p></p>but he was awakened by his alarm, resulting in his current state of exhaustion.
        <p></p>Mahiru, on the other hand, looked fresh and had a good complexion, as if she had slept
        <p></p>just fine. She seemed very anxious, though, and constantly fidgeted like she was trying
        <p></p>hard to conceal her embarrassment.
        <p></p>Amane had been just about to eat breakfast when Mahiru had barged in. Now he was
        <p></p>stuck, unsure of how to proceed.
        <p></p>Her reward had been too exhilarating, and now that he knew that feeling, he found it
        <p></p>hard to look at Mahiru directly. To make matters worse, Mahiru didn't seem to realize
        <p></p>what had happened, so feelings of guilt weighed on his chest, in addition to the shame.
        <p></p>"…Wh-what are you doing here in the morning? Oh, I know, you came to get your key
        <p></p>back, right? Sorry for taking it home with me."
        <p></p>"Ah, no, I… well, there is that, but that's not why I'm here."
        <p></p>No matter how close they might be, Amane felt it was wrong to take home a girl's
        <p></p>house key. He was already feeling bad about setting foot in her apartment, even though
        <p></p>he hadn't really been able to avoid it.
        <p></p>…As I suspected, she's mad that I saw her bedroom.
        <p></p>Amane remembered her room being very neat and tidy, but he couldn't fault her for
        <p></p>being upset that he had rudely taken a look while she was basically unconscious. If
        <p></p>he'd happened to see her underwear or something hung up to dry, Mahiru probably
        <p></p>wouldn't have looked at him or spoken to him for a while, and Amane was sure he
        <p></p>would have had to avoid her for some time as well.
        <p></p>Thankfully he hadn't caught sight of anything like that.
        <p></p>"C-can I ask you one thing?" Mahiru inquired.
        <p></p>"Sure."
        <p></p>"…O-on top of my desk, there should have been a picture frame, but…"
        <p></p>"A picture frame?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>It wouldn't have been polite to scrutinize her room too closely, so Amane had only
        <p></p>taken a quick look around, and he didn't particularly remember there being one. It
        <p></p>sounded like it had been jumbled in with the rest of the stuff on her desk, judging by
        <p></p>her tone.
        <p></p>Amane searched his memory but had no recollection of a picture frame, so he figured
        <p></p>he had just missed it.
        <p></p>"No, I didn't see one, but… did something happen? Did I bump into it and break it, or
        <p></p>something?"
        <p></p>"N-no! A-as long as you didn't see it, that's fine… if you didn't see it."
        <p></p>Apparently, Mahiru had something displayed in a picture frame that he wasn't
        <p></p>supposed to see. Her obvious relief made him kind of wish he had. But it was a matter
        <p></p>of privacy, so he wasn't going to say that out loud.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked like a great weight had been lifted from her shoulders.
        <p></p>Amane scratched his cheek. "I tried not to look at your room too much, you know? All
        <p></p>I saw was the lineup of stuffed animals I gave you, and the teddy bear by your pillow
        <p></p>that you sleep with…"
        <p></p>"Forget you saw that!" Mahiru slapped Amane's arm softly.
        <p></p>"But you already told me about it…," Amane answered without thinking.
        <p></p>Mahiru glared at him. "Don't tell me I was hugging the stuffed animal while you were
        <p></p>there."
        <p></p>"…You were half asleep, and you demanded that I sleep there with you, which I wasn't
        <p></p>about to do, so instead, I brought you the bear to sleep with."
        <p></p>"Sleep there with me?!"
        <p></p>Mahiru looked shocked, like she couldn't believe her own words. Gradually, her whole
        <p></p>face turned red.
        <p></p>She must not want to believe she said something like that when she was half asleep…
        <p></p>"D-did I really say something like that?!"
        <p></p>"N-not only did you say it, you actually called my name and patted the space beside
        <p></p>you… like you were telling me to climb into the same bed…"
        <p></p>"Aaugh!"
        <p></p>Mahiru put her hands on her cheeks and made a pathetic noise. Her face was bright
        <p></p>red, and her eyes were wavering like she might cry.
        <p></p>"N-no way, I don't usually have such… thoughts! I just, um, I… felt relaxed since you
        <p></p>were around, so… it's not that I really had any untoward desires… it must have been
        <p></p>something like I wanted your b-body heat, that's it."
        <p></p>"What's that supposed to mean?"
        <p></p>"Please don't ask me anymore!"
        <p></p>It was truly rare for Mahiru to raise her voice, and she was breathing hard as she
        <p></p>sharply turned away.
        <p></p>For once, Amane was the calm one. "F-fine, I don't really understand why you're so
        <p></p>upset, but I'm not going to pry. Just be careful from now on. You were half asleep, but
        <p></p>I did more or less get your permission before I took you home. But if you hadn't woken
        <p></p>up, I was going to have to put you to bed in my room."
        <p></p>"…That would have been fine."
        <p></p>"What did you say?"
        <p></p>"Nothing."
        <p></p>Amane could tell that she had said something quietly, but he hadn't been able to make
        <p></p>out Mahiru's mumbling. It seemed like it wasn't meant for him to hear.
        <p></p>"Anyway, you've got to understand that no matter how much of a trusted friend I am,
        <p></p>I can't just let you sleep here. If you try it again, I'll have no choice but to use you as a
        <p></p>body pillow when I sleep, no joke."
        <p></p>Though he had just made quite a bold claim, Amane knew that he wouldn't get any
        <p></p>rest if something like that happened. He was just trying to warn Mahiru against being
        <p></p>so careless. There were a few people she really trusted, but he still thought she ought
        <p></p>to be more cautious, even around those companions.
        <p></p>In response to Amane's slightly critical tone, Mahiru blinked dramatically, then put on
        <p></p>a faint smile.
        <p></p>"Says the same Amane who fell asleep so easily in my lap. You've dozed off in my lap
        <p></p>twice now, you know?"
        <p></p>"Th-that's a different conversation. It's a completely different matter for a guy to fall
        <p></p>asleep in front of a member of the opposite sex than for a girl to do it. I wouldn't be in
        <p></p>any danger."
        <p></p>"…Even though you don't know for sure that I won't do anything?"
        <p></p>"Would you?"
        <p></p>"Let me think… Maybe I would take your picture or something, as a joke."
        <p></p>Amane grew weak as Mahiru looked at him smugly, as if to say, "What do you think
        <p></p>about that?" but Mahiru didn't seem to notice.
        <p></p>"…I wouldn't really care, but now I'm going to have to check your phone."
        <p></p>"And what if I saved it on the cloud before you realized, and then deleted it from my
        <p></p>phone?
        <p></p>"Stop talking about it. I'm starting to believe you might try and it's freaking me out. Also,
        <p></p>my 'doing something' and your 'doing something' are different matters, so seriously, be
        <p></p>more careful." Amane grabbed her shoulders and spoke soberly. "You're not
        <p></p>understanding me at all."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked surprised, but didn't pull away, and didn't avert her eyes, either. "I
        <p></p>understand perfectly well. It's fine."
        <p></p>"You really don't. Not even a little."
        <p></p>"How rude! I said I do. I think you're underestimating me."
        <p></p>"If you understood, you wouldn't be doing these things."
        <p></p>"…You still need work, Amane."
        <p></p>Amane frowned, not sure why she was getting so frustrated with him, but Mahiru just
        <p></p>sighed softly, slipped out of his grasp, and headed for the hallway.
        <p></p>In Mahiru's hand was the house key that she had come to collect, which she must have
        <p></p>grabbed without him noticing. He had left it on the tray on top of his shoe cubby in the
        <p></p>entryway of his apartment.
        <p></p>"You have some thinking to do, Amane," she said as she left his apartment.
        <p></p>Amane thought that she might just as well direct that line at herself. Holding his
        <p></p>forehead, he grumbled, "Which one of us doesn't understand?"
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 48: : The Angel’s New Clothes 
        <p></p>Exams were over, and it was the middle of May.
        <p></p>The sun's gentle rays grew brighter as it created a springlike atmosphere. It was that
        <p></p>time of the year when it was starting to get uncomfortable to wear long sleeves.
        <p></p>May was supposed to be the time for a seasonal change of clothing, but the work of
        <p></p>pulling out his short-sleeved shirts and summer slacks was awfully troublesome, and
        <p></p>Amane had been putting it off.
        <p></p>Though the air conditioners in school were set to the perfect temperature, as soon as
        <p></p>he took a single step outside the classroom, or set off to and from school, he felt hot.
        <p></p>Eventually, Amane came to the decision that it was time to get his summer clothes out.
        <p></p>"It's getting to be the season when we'll want short sleeves, huh?" Mahiru asked. She'd
        <p></p>nodded in understanding as she watched him pull his summer clothes out of a
        <p></p>garment case that he stored in the back of his closet and threw them into the washing
        <p></p>machine to wear for tomorrow.
        <p></p>Incidentally, Mahiru was also still dressing in long sleeves and tights, in a way that
        <p></p>avoided exposing any unnecessary skin.
        <p></p>She had switched to wearing a sweater vest under her blazer, but looking at her all
        <p></p>covered up, Amane worried that she might be hot.
        <p></p>"The weather is changing, and I've been feeling a little sweaty. I'm thinking it's about
        <p></p>time for me to phase out my long sleeves, too. Today was really warm, wasn't it?"
        <p></p>"You never let your clothes get sloppy, eh, Mahiru? You button everything up properly,
        <p></p>and don't roll your sleeves up, and you usually have tights on…"
        <p></p>"People always stare at me when I let any skin show, and it really bothers me. I feel
        <p></p>compelled to dress that way… It's like a form of self-defense."
        <p></p>Mahiru was beautiful and had a very keen sense of style, so she was often troubled by
        <p></p>people's gawking.
        <p></p>No matter what, she attracted attention, and that often included inappropriate stares.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't unsympathetic to the fact that men were naturally inclined to look at
        <p></p>beautiful women, but he could tell that Mahiru hated to be ogled.
        <p></p>"I'm never sure how to dress for summer," she said. "Last year, I wore some really thin
        <p></p>black stockings, but they were still pretty warm."
        <p></p>"Seems like they would be. Girls have to wear more pieces of clothing than guys do,
        <p></p>which seems like it would be hot…"
        <p></p>"Well, I can put up with a little warmth if I'm doing it to protect myself, but… the issue
        <p></p>of overheating is a real problem."
        <p></p>Mahiru sighed and said she hated summer for that reason. Amane didn't know how
        <p></p>he should answer and ended up staying silent. Mahiru didn't seem to mind, and let her
        <p></p>gaze wander over to the washing machine.
        <p></p>"So you'll start wearing your summer clothes tomorrow?" she asked.
        <p></p>"Well, I was thinking it's about time to change. It's already this sweltering…"
        <p></p>"I see. I've also been considering it, but before I can go to school, I feel like I've got to
        <p></p>try everything on at least once to check the fit. I think my size hasn't changed, but just
        <p></p>in case…"
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed very concerned about maintaining her figure, and it didn't seem like
        <p></p>she would have let herself get out of shape.
        <p></p>Amane admired her strong willpower and discipline. He knew that he could never be
        <p></p>as strict with himself as Mahiru was with herself, but he wished that he too had an
        <p></p>ideal body that he could maintain. First, he would have to start by getting his ideal
        <p></p>body, though.
        <p></p>"I'd better try mine on, too, or it could be bad. I've gotten a little taller since starting
        <p></p>school, so if they don't fit, I'll have to buy new ones at the school store."
        <p></p>Amane had purchased his summer uniform before starting high school, so now that
        <p></p>he was in his second year, he was worried it might be a little short on him. It had been
        <p></p>fine during the summer of his first year, and he hadn't had any problems with his
        <p></p>winter uniform, but his clothes might have become a little bit too tight for him, even
        <p></p>though he'd initially bought them a bit larger.
        <p></p>He had grown more than five centimeters since starting high school, and there was a
        <p></p>good chance his summer clothes were too small.
        <p></p>Thinking he would try them on after the laundry was finished, Amane gazed over at
        <p></p>the washing machine, which was making a dull mechanical noise.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked up at him.
        <p></p>"…You're pretty tall, aren't you, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Well, I guess I'm a little taller than average."
        <p></p>Amane was about one head taller than Mahiru, who was still staring up at him.
        <p></p>Mahiru had a petite build, but that didn't mean she was particularly small; in fact, she
        <p></p>was average. Amane's eyeline was just a little higher than it had been when he had
        <p></p>first met her, which made him realize again that he had been growing.
        <p></p>Usually, he stood at a bit of a distance when talking to Mahiru, so as not to overtax her
        <p></p>neck, but recently, she had been standing much closer to him, enough to touch, and
        <p></p>he'd started to worry about her neck getting cramps.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem to care about such things at the moment. She was scrutinizing
        <p></p>Amane and frowning slightly.
        <p></p>"…I do worry about you, though. You don't weigh very much, for how tall you are."
        <p></p>"That's why I'm exercising and training to put on more muscle," he replied. "More
        <p></p>importantly, why do you know how much I weigh, anyway?"
        <p></p>"Because I saw you weigh yourself on the scale by the sink when you woke up late one
        <p></p>weekend. I was the one who pushed you over to the sink, when you were half asleep."
        <p></p>There was nothing Amane could say to that, so he stayed quiet, but Mahiru looked at
        <p></p>him with exasperation in her eyes.
        <p></p>"It looks like you're working hard, and I see you putting in the effort, but you've got to
        <p></p>eat a little more after you exercise, Amane. You're thin, and it makes me worry. After
        <p></p>all, food is what builds the body, right? If you tell me ahead of time when you're going
        <p></p>to exercise, I can adjust the menu."
        <p></p>"I'm really making a lot of work for you, but… I'm grateful for the offer. And since we're
        <p></p>still on the topic, you're kind of thin yourself. Sometimes I worry you might break, so
        <p></p>you should eat more, too, please."
        <p></p>Of course, Amane was grateful; he never had to worry about meals thanks to Mahiru.
        <p></p>She was even gracious enough to prepare extra food to help with his weight training.
        <p></p>But he thought that Mahiru herself ought to eat more, too. He could tell she was
        <p></p>delicate even through her clothes, and occasionally when he touched her, she was so
        <p></p>thin that he was anxious he might break her. From what he had seen, she had never
        <p></p>been one to eat that much, which probably made it easier for her to manage her figure,
        <p></p>but it concerned him that she was so petite.
        <p></p>"You're super thin," he said, and grabbed her narrow waist, realizing just how lean her
        <p></p>body really was.
        <p></p>A high-pitched shriek came from Mahiru's mouth, and the sound interrupted any
        <p></p>further thoughts.
        <p></p>"…Ah, s-sorry," he fumbled.
        <p></p>"N-no, it's fine, it's okay," Mahiru said. "Just, if you touch a girl's belly too much… there
        <p></p>are girls who develop complexes about that stuff, okay?"
        <p></p>"I'm really sorry for touching you like that. It's sexual harassment to touch a girl's body
        <p></p>without asking, isn't it? I'm very, very sorry."
        <p></p>"Okay, you don't have to go that far…"
        <p></p>Although they were good friends, they were still the opposite sex, so naturally, Amane
        <p></p>was very careful about how he touched Mahiru.
        <p></p>But he had just touched her stomach—not her head, or her hand, or her shoulder, but
        <p></p>her stomach, a very personal location. He had gotten worked up about how thin she
        <p></p>was, but that was no excuse, and he immediately regretted touching her belly without
        <p></p>her permission.
        <p></p>"I don't really mind it that much, so calm down, Amane. And anyway, I don't suppose
        <p></p>you do things like that with anyone other than me?"
        <p></p>"I don't have this kind of back-and-forth with anyone other than you," he answered.
        <p></p>"Also, I hardly ever interact with any other girls. It's not like I would randomly touch a
        <p></p>girl I don't know that well."
        <p></p>The only other girl he might possibly touch would be Chitose. She was slim, a bit like
        <p></p>Mahiru, but it was more of a lean athleticism, different from Mahiru's petite delicacy.
        <p></p>Though he would never even really touch Chitose like that in the first place, aside from
        <p></p>occasionally, playfully bopping her on the head.
        <p></p>"Well, I'm glad to hear that," Mahiru nodded. She seemed satisfied with Amane's
        <p></p>answer. Then, maybe as payback, she leaned forward and pressed her palm against
        <p></p>Amane's stomach, touching him through his shirt.
        <p></p>He wasn't going to scold her, considering he had just done the same to her, but it
        <p></p>tickled, and he felt embarrassed about his body.
        <p></p>Compared to how he had been before Mahiru had improved his diet, he was healthier
        <p></p>now, but his body was still a far cry from his ideal muscular figure.
        <p></p>It had been quite a shock to hear that she was worried about him being too thin, so he
        <p></p>knew he needed to eat and exercise more to build muscle onto his frame.
        <p></p>"…Do you think I'd be better if I were a little stronger, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Strong is nice, but I think that at the end of the day, the most attractive type of body,
        <p></p>for either sex, is a healthy body. Also, this is my personal opinion as a girl, and I would
        <p></p>absolutely never want to force it on anyone else, but… when a girl is standing next to
        <p></p>a really skinny guy, there's a possibility that she will feel awkward, so maybe a medium
        <p></p>build is better than being all skin and bones."
        <p></p>"I see…"
        <p></p>"B-but you're not necessarily… I wouldn't go so far as to say you're too thin, okay,
        <p></p>Amane? But it would be healthier for you to eat a little more. You're not the type to
        <p></p>overeat, despite being a high school boy. Speaking of which, Amane, um, when it comes
        <p></p>to girls… do you like slim ones best?"
        <p></p>"It's rude to comment on girls' physiques," Amane answered immediately. It was
        <p></p>something he thought every guy was supposed to know.
        <p></p>Both his parents always told him, "If you say something, and it goes over poorly, prepare
        <p></p>to see blood," so Amane always avoided commenting on anybody's figure.
        <p></p>"Ah…" Mahiru sounded like she understood his flat assertion, and her gaze drifted off
        <p></p>into the distance. He figured that girls must have the same understanding.
        <p></p>"Well, I guess it's better to be on the slim side," Amane said. "But if you're too thin, it's
        <p></p>worrisome, because it can be bad for your health and might mean you're not getting
        <p></p>enough nutrients. It gives peace of mind to see that someone has the proper amount
        <p></p>of muscle and fat on them."
        <p></p>"…That sounds more like something a parent would say than something you'd hear
        <p></p>from a young man, don't you think?"
        <p></p>"You're one to talk."
        <p></p>"Fair enough, but…"
        <p></p>If anything, Mahiru was the one who had a motherly attitude sometimes. So Amane
        <p></p>didn't think she had any right to accuse him of having a "parental" gaze or whatever.
        <p></p>"Even if I'm not worried about you, I don't think there's any need for you to be on a
        <p></p>diet, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"Really?"
        <p></p>"Where could you possibly lose it from? You've got your ideal body, and now you're
        <p></p>trying to maintain it, right? It's not my place to say anything, but I think the best body
        <p></p>for you is one you feel confident about. And personally, I would worry if you got too
        <p></p>thin, so I'd like you to stay just as you are."
        <p></p>He would definitely be concerned if Mahiru, who was already quite thin, lost any more
        <p></p>weight. He wanted her to know that her figure was fine just as it was. If she wanted to
        <p></p>get any skinnier, he would have to stop her.
        <p></p>"I understand that it's difficult to maintain a certain figure, but I think it's more
        <p></p>important to be healthy."
        <p></p>"…Sure."
        <p></p>Almost in rhythm with Mahiru's nodding head, the washing machine continued
        <p></p>tumbling his laundry around with a loud rattle.
        <p></p>"Good morning."
        <p></p>The following morning, when Amane woke up, Mahiru was there in his apartment.
        <p></p>He turned around and looked behind him at the clock in his bedroom. It was time to
        <p></p>get up and ready for the day, not time to leave his apartment yet.
        <p></p>Mahiru had visited his apartment a handful of times in the morning before, but it was
        <p></p>something that generally didn't happen, so Amane's sleepy mind was confused.
        <p></p>"…Morning?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had a spare key, and he had told her she could come in as she pleased, but he
        <p></p>hadn't expected to encounter her so early in the day.
        <p></p>When, in his bewilderment, he returned her greeting with a questioning tone, Mahiru
        <p></p>put on a gentle smile.
        <p></p>"I know it might be rude for me to come over like this in the morning, but… I was
        <p></p>hoping I could get you to check something for me before I left home."
        <p></p>"Check something?"
        <p></p>At that point, he took a second look at Mahiru and realized that he could see a bit more
        <p></p>skin than usual.
        <p></p>"I changed my clothes. Does anything look off?"
        <p></p>"Ah, summer clothes… uhh, no, well—"
        <p></p>"Yes?"
        <p></p>"…I'm not sure having your legs bare… is a good idea."
        <p></p>Summer clothes meant short sleeves, but that wasn't what Amane was talking about.
        <p></p>When he looked down, he could see her pure, pale thighs peeking out from under her
        <p></p>skirt.
        <p></p>School uniforms featured longer skirts than most street clothes, and Mahiru usually
        <p></p>wore tights as well, so he hadn't gotten a good look at her bare legs before. In keeping
        <p></p>with school rules, Mahiru's new skirt was plenty long enough to keep everything
        <p></p>covered, but even so, her bare legs were now exposed to the air.
        <p></p>Amane was understandably flustered, and his eyes darted around nervously.
        <p></p>"Well, I was thinking that not many girls wear tights at school right now," Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"That's true, b-but I don't think it's right for y-you. It's no good."
        <p></p>"Is that because you can't handle seeing my bare legs?"
        <p></p>"Th-that's not it!" he protested. "It's more like, if you show them off, the other boys
        <p></p>will probably make a fuss and stare, so it's a bad idea, I think."
        <p></p>The day before, they'd had a whole conversation about Mahiru's black stockings.
        <p></p>Amane had never thought she would appear without them.
        <p></p>The pale expanse of her legs was too dazzling. He couldn't look right at them.
        <p></p>"You sure you're not going to stare, too, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Everything has a limit, you know!"
        <p></p>"But it's a fact that you saw my legs when I twisted my ankle, remember?"
        <p></p>"That was an emergency, and anyway, I was a perfect gentleman! I even covered your
        <p></p>lap with my blazer, didn't I?!"
        <p></p>Sure, he might have caught a peek at her legs when he'd knelt down beside her, but
        <p></p>he'd been careful to drape his blazer over her so that he couldn't see anything
        <p></p>untoward. He'd devoted all of his attention to treating her ankle so that he wouldn't
        <p></p>look anywhere inappropriate. Hence, he had honestly never ogled Mahiru's legs. Even
        <p></p>Amane knew better than that.
        <p></p>"Well, are you having any imprudent thoughts right now?"
        <p></p>"…No."
        <p></p>"The way you hesitated is a bit worrying."
        <p></p>"No!"
        <p></p>"Don't get all worked up. Sorry for teasing you too much. I've known from the start
        <p></p>that you weren't looking at me like that. You just don't know where you should be
        <p></p>directing your attention."
        <p></p>"If you knew that, then you shouldn't have felt the need to question me…"
        <p></p>"No, it was necessary for my own satisfaction. Making your heart pound is the most
        <p></p>important part, you see."
        <p></p>"So you did this just to give me a heart attack?"
        <p></p>Clearly, Mahiru had wanted to start the day with a bit of fun.
        <p></p>Amane looked at her grudgingly as he realized that he'd fallen for it, hook, line, and
        <p></p>sinker. Mahiru, the prankster, just stared back at him, grinning in her elegant way.
        <p></p>"Relax," she said. "I brought stockings with me, and I was planning to put them on."
        <p></p>"Unbelievable…" Amane groaned, knowing she was trying to get a rise out of him. Then
        <p></p>he decided to get a little bit of revenge and stared back into Mahiru's caramel-colored
        <p></p>eyes that were twinkling happily.
        <p></p>"…So you don't mind me looking at you?"
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>Mahiru stared at him in surprise.
        <p></p>Without breaking eye contact, Amane continued, "You went out of your way to come
        <p></p>show me your bare legs. That must mean you want me to look at them, right?"
        <p></p>"…That's, um, I don't really mind… if you see them—"
        <p></p>"You don't think it's a big deal…"
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed very confused. "That's not—it's not necessarily the case, though…"
        <p></p>Amane sighed softly. "Well then, don't show me. You should only do things like that for
        <p></p>people you want to look at you."
        <p></p>He wished she would put herself in his shoes and imagine what it was like for a guy to
        <p></p>see a new side of a girl he loved. But of course, he couldn't say anything like that. It
        <p></p>was only the start of the day, and already he was feeling exhausted.
        <p></p>Timidly, Mahiru tugged at the sleeve of Amane's pajamas. "…Wh-what if I said I came
        <p></p>to show you because I wanted to?"
        <p></p>Her quiet voice trembled bashfully as she looked up at him with watery eyes. This
        <p></p>time, Amane completely froze up.
        <p></p>"Because I wanted to see your reaction… But all you said was that it's no good," Mahiru
        <p></p>mumbled, looking a little dejected.
        <p></p>Amane shook his head frantically. "Th-that's because it's not. Look, how do I say this?
        <p></p>It's troublesome, like… I don't know where I'm supposed to be looking…"
        <p></p>"So you think bare legs don't suit me?"
        <p></p>Amane reluctantly looked down at Mahiru's outfit. She was dressed in a crisp, ironed
        <p></p>short-sleeved blouse and skirt. The outfit exuded her usual tidy elegance, while also
        <p></p>giving off a fresher image, and the buttons and ribbon on her shirt, done properly all
        <p></p>the way up to her neck, were a reminder of her serious nature.
        <p></p>Amane might have preferred it if it were a little harder to see all the angles and curves
        <p></p>of her figure, but these were her summer clothes, so there was nothing to be done
        <p></p>about it.
        <p></p>He looked her over once, trying as best he could not to let his eyes linger on her
        <p></p>perfect, slender legs, then slowly opened his mouth to speak, a little fraught.
        <p></p>"…You look very cute, and those clothes suit you, so please, go put on your stockings
        <p></p>immediately."
        <p></p>"Okay."
        <p></p>Mahiru must have been satisfied by these brief, carefully chosen words of praise
        <p></p>because she gave Amane a gentle, broad smile and nodded.
        <p></p>Momentarily struck speechless by that smile, Amane turned away before Mahiru
        <p></p>could notice, looking toward the bathroom sink.
        <p></p>"Don't come playing tricks on me like this again. I'm going to wash my face and change,
        <p></p>so while I do that, please sort your clothes out and get ready to leave," he said, speaking
        <p></p>somewhat more quickly than usual, and hurried into the bathroom.
        <p></p>Mahiru giggled softly behind his back.
        <p></p>Amane finished getting dressed for the day, and when he headed into the living room,
        <p></p>Mahiru was sitting quietly on the sofa waiting for him. She was fully covered, in black
        <p></p>stockings and a sweater vest. Amane wondered if what he'd seen earlier had even
        <p></p>been real.
        <p></p>He couldn't help but feel exhausted by the whole affair.
        <p></p>"…You know, if you'd shown me this look from the start, I would have been able to offer
        <p></p>you an honest opinion, without worrying about how my heart is going to hold up."
        <p></p>"How nice for you; you got a special treat."
        <p></p>Mahiru grinned shamelessly, which made him a little angry. He walked up to her and
        <p></p>pinched her cheek, but she still kept smiling happily.
        <p></p>"…Well then, I'm going to leave for school ahead of you," Mahiru said, standing up from
        <p></p>her seat after watching Amane devour the breakfast she'd prepared.
        <p></p>To get him back in a good mood, she had made a rolled omelet. Amane was fully aware
        <p></p>of her ploy, but couldn't help feeling better anyway and went with her to the door to
        <p></p>see her off.
        <p></p>They walked the same route to the same school, so it seemed a little ridiculous to leave
        <p></p>separately. Even so, there was no way they could arrive at school together, thus the
        <p></p>only other option was to stagger when they left.
        <p></p>"See you at school," Amane said. He was planning to wait long enough to avoid
        <p></p>suspicion, as always, but he noticed that Mahiru was wearing a somewhat dissatisfied
        <p></p>expression. He tilted his head questioningly. "What is it?"
        <p></p>"…Just wondering if there will ever come a day when we can walk together."
        <p></p>"The stares alone would kill me."
        <p></p>Recently, Amane had been seen interacting with Mahiru more and more often, and
        <p></p>their classmates seemed to have gotten used to it, to a certain degree. However, Amane
        <p></p>still received many jealous looks, and when it came to the students in other
        <p></p>classrooms, they often glared at him.
        <p></p>Amane was already fed up with being on the receiving end of their overly aggressive
        <p></p>stares, and if he and Mahiru started going to and from school together, the negative
        <p></p>attention was sure to increase to a level he had never yet experienced.
        <p></p>"I suppose that's to be expected," Mahiru sighed. "…Though we're just reaping what
        <p></p>we've sown, at this point. It's all so exhaustingly inconvenient."
        <p></p>"I imagine that having everyone at school make a big deal of you just walking with a
        <p></p>guy would be pretty unbearable for you, too, no?"
        <p></p>"Actually, I don't really care if anyone makes a big deal out of it, but I know it would
        <p></p>cause trouble for you. If it didn't bother you, I'd be more than happy to go together."
        <p></p>"…You're sure about that?"
        <p></p>"If our timing matches up, that is. It's a pain to go out of our way to stagger the times
        <p></p>we leave, and it's inefficient on days like this. Besides, isn't it more fun to walk to school
        <p></p>with someone you like?"
        <p></p>"That's true, but—"
        <p></p>"Isn't it? I guess reality doesn't always go the way we want it to."
        <p></p>After a big, exhausted yawn, Mahiru shook her head once and then transformed before
        <p></p>his eyes, putting on her usual elegant, angelic smile.
        <p></p>"All right, I'm off. I wanted to show you my new summer look first thing in the morning,
        <p></p>so I'm glad I was able to come do that," Mahiru said casually. She batted her eyes at
        <p></p>Amane, who was still frozen in place by her provocative statement.
        <p></p>"See you later," she said as she opened the front door. "Make sure not to be late, okay,
        <p></p>Amane?"
        <p></p>Mahiru slipped bashfully past the doorway and set off for school. Amane leaned his
        <p></p>head against the wall of the hallway for a little while, then decided he should go wash
        <p></p>his face again. He was seriously worried about what was to come.
        <p></p>Amane left his apartment late enough to give Mahiru a solid head start. When he
        <p></p>finally arrived at school, he was not surprised to see people gathered around her,
        <p></p>checking out her new outfit.
        <p></p>The temperature had been steadily rising, and it was definitely time for new clothes
        <p></p>to match the season. Plenty of students had already changed into short sleeves.
        <p></p>Even though Mahiru was wearing lighter summer clothing, she looked very prim and
        <p></p>proper in it. Though because of her gorgeous appearance, her change of outfit still
        <p></p>attracted more attention than usual.
        <p></p>On top of all that, Chitose had gotten to her seat and declared, "That hairstyle looks
        <p></p>like it's sooo warm!" and tied Mahiru's hair up in a ponytail for her. The unusual
        <p></p>hairstyle was drawing even more stares—with her hair up, the nape of Mahiru's neck
        <p></p>was visible.
        <p></p>Amane didn't like that much. Mahiru was obviously free to style her hair any way she
        <p></p>wished, but he couldn't help but feel upset that other people were staring at the girl
        <p></p>he loved.
        <p></p>…How can I think that way? She doesn't belong to me.
        <p></p>Amane glanced over at Mahiru again, practically seething with unwarranted jealousy.
        <p></p>He was starting to hate himself for it.
        <p></p>Itsuki peered at Amane with that strangely perceptive look of his. "Oh, are we feeling
        <p></p>a little out of sorts?" he asked slyly.
        <p></p>Amane brushed him off with feigned ignorance. "…Must be your imagination."
        <p></p>Then for some reason, Itsuki looked over at Mahiru and nodded like he understood
        <p></p>everything.
        <p></p>When he looked back at Amane, he was smiling, or rather grinning. Amane could feel
        <p></p>himself getting even more flustered.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 49: The Angel’s Gaze and Amane’s Struggle 
        <p></p>"Amane, pass it here!"
        <p></p>"But you've got terrible control!"
        <p></p>The school Sports Day was coming up next month, and the students were leisurely
        <p></p>enjoying gym class.
        <p></p>Remembering the previous Sports Day, Amane knew once the teams were announced
        <p></p>sometime next week, the whole school would start preparing for it, but for now, they
        <p></p>were still having regular gym classes.
        <p></p>Listening to the echo of the basketball club's squeaking shoes, Amane glared at Itsuki,
        <p></p>who had thrown the ball sloppily into the wall as a joke, and chased after the ball as it
        <p></p>rolled away.
        <p></p>They were playing basketball that day, and soon it would be time to practice their
        <p></p>shots. It sounded like they were going to have a game during the second half of class.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't particularly good at basketball, but he didn't mind tossing the ball into
        <p></p>the hoop a bit.
        <p></p>As Amane chased the old, brown basketball rolling slowly away from the wall, he shot
        <p></p>a quick glance across the net dividing the gym in two. On the other side, the girls' class
        <p></p>was playing badminton. The girls were supposed to have been outside, but due to a
        <p></p>sudden downpour, everyone was having gym inside the divided gymnasium.
        <p></p>The girls also seemed to be playing leisurely, and from time to time, Amane would
        <p></p>catch sight of one of them lightly batting the shuttlecock with their racket. He grabbed
        <p></p>the ball and jogged back.
        <p></p>He was careful not to even look in Mahiru's direction. He wanted to avoid any chance
        <p></p>of anybody noticing and accusing him of having a crush on the angel.
        <p></p>He did like her, but he knew it would be troubling for her to hear those sorts of rumors.
        <p></p>He also didn't want to let any unfamiliar classmates know about it, so he kept it a
        <p></p>secret.
        <p></p>"Stop throwing the ball off in weird directions," Amane said. "It'll be awkward if I have
        <p></p>to go get it from the girls' side."
        <p></p>Itsuki grinned foolishly. "Come on, don't be so sensitive."
        <p></p>Amane threw the ball with a little force at his friend's stomach, and Itsuki, who wasn't
        <p></p>particularly bad at sports, caught it without breaking his grin. With a long sigh, Amane
        <p></p>got a new ball from the ball hamper.
        <p></p>The members of the sports clubs were always in high spirits during these sorts of gym
        <p></p>classes. This time, it was the basketball club that was in their element, and they were
        <p></p>especially lively.
        <p></p>Amane didn't really like basketball, but he was surprisingly fond of shooting practice,
        <p></p>so he had been throwing the ball at the basket all class, to show the gym teacher that
        <p></p>he was taking it seriously.
        <p></p>He threw another ball. It arced through the air, rebounded off the backboard, and fell
        <p></p>through the center of the basket. Amane retrieved it with a slight feeling of satisfaction.
        <p></p>"You're good at this kind of thing," Itsuki observed. "Though whenever a game starts
        <p></p>up, you lose all your motivation, and then you're useless. You should try harder."
        <p></p>"Be quiet. You can't expect someone who's a natural-born introverted member of the
        <p></p>'go-home club' to put in a ton of effort in a basketball game. Obviously, the guys in the
        <p></p>sports clubs are going to be the ones actually playing."
        <p></p>"I guess so. Hey, I was just thinking, you ought to show that special someone how cool
        <p></p>you can be from time to time."
        <p></p>Amane knew exactly who Itsuki was referring to, but he wasn't going to just nod
        <p></p>obediently.
        <p></p>"I don't need you to worry about that," he said. "She already knows that I'm no good at
        <p></p>sports and that I'm very uncool."
        <p></p>"Why do you always have to turn it around like that?"
        <p></p>"You have to know by now that telling me to make an effort here is a losing proposition,
        <p></p>right?"
        <p></p>Amane looked at Itsuki, who seemed disinterested in the outcome, with a sour
        <p></p>expression, and was confronted with more cackling laughter.
        <p></p>"Come on now, this is your chance," Itsuki urged.
        <p></p>"It is not. Why don't you give it a try then, see how it goes?"
        <p></p>"Huh? No way, man. I'm not that good."
        <p></p>"Well then, where do you get off telling me what to do?"
        <p></p>Amane grabbed Itsuki under the chin and squeezed his cheeks with his fingers,
        <p></p>warning him not to casually demand things that he couldn't do himself.
        <p></p>"Sorry, sorry!" As he was laughing it off, Itsuki looked over to the other side of the net.
        <p></p>"But she is looking over here, though."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>Amane followed Itsuki's gaze and saw Mahiru, waiting her turn to play badminton,
        <p></p>looking in his direction. Staring, to be more accurate. She was definitely staring at
        <p></p>Amane.
        <p></p>She was probably just killing time by looking around, but Amane suddenly started
        <p></p>feeling uncomfortable, now that he knew he was being watched. He pursed his lips
        <p></p>awkwardly.
        <p></p>Itsuki mumbled, "Better try your best," like he was glad it wasn't his problem, and
        <p></p>pulled Amane along with him after the gym teacher's whistle sounded.
        <p></p>For the practice game in the second half, the class was divided into two teams, to play
        <p></p>against two different teams from another class.
        <p></p>Amane and Itsuki were playing in the second round, so to avoid getting in the way of
        <p></p>the rest of the players, they climbed up onto the stage at the end of the gym and took
        <p></p>a seat.
        <p></p>The two of them were watching the imposing figure of Yuuta, who was on the team
        <p></p>playing the first game. He was putting on a good show.
        <p></p>"How is Kadowaki keeping up against the actual basketball club…?"
        <p></p>Some of the players on the opposing team were in the basketball club, but Yuuta played
        <p></p>well enough to put them on equal footing. Even though Yuuta was an experienced
        <p></p>athlete, at the end of the day, he could not match them point for point. If it had just
        <p></p>been a matter of speed, the track star might have had an advantage, but when it came
        <p></p>to agility and handling, not to mention the coordination required to shoot the ball, the
        <p></p>members of the basketball club were able to show off their specialized skills.
        <p></p>Amane had expected the basketball club would have an advantage and that his
        <p></p>classmates would be entirely shut out, but Yuuta quickly disproved that prediction by
        <p></p>continuing to score points.
        <p></p>"Well, Yuuta's the product of an athletic family, after all," Itsuki said. "He just chose the
        <p></p>track club because he likes running, but he can play just about any sport at a high
        <p></p>level."
        <p></p>"How is he so strong?"
        <p></p>"Apparently, his mother was a sports trainer or something like that. I think he told me
        <p></p>that his older sisters are going into related occupations, too."
        <p></p>"So he's the result of a gifted education."
        <p></p>"Whoa! Watch Kadowaki, guys!"
        <p></p>"Block him, block him!"
        <p></p>"Don't let him get anywhere!"
        <p></p>"Are we sure he doesn't have some awful grudge against us?"
        <p></p>"If he finds a good opening, this is really gonna look bad for the basketball club!"
        <p></p>Amane was half-listening to the cries of the opposing team. He could also hear the girls
        <p></p>cheering Yuuta on from across the partition.
        <p></p>They seemed to have started their own tournament of badminton on the other side of
        <p></p>the gym, and the girls who weren't actively playing had come up to the net to watch
        <p></p>the game.
        <p></p>The other boys, as well, were understandably enthusiastic about Yuuta's performance.
        <p></p>Murmurs of admiration swept the crowd. For some reason, Itsuki slapped Amane on
        <p></p>the back.
        <p></p>In the end, their class was victorious in the first game. Amane jumped down from the
        <p></p>stage, marveling at his amazing friend.
        <p></p>Throwing on the team jersey he had been given, Amane stepped onto the court, not
        <p></p>bothering to hide his expression of irritation, and accidentally made eye contact with
        <p></p>Mahiru on the other side of the net.
        <p></p>She was wearing a faint smile, different from her usual gentle, angelic type. It was
        <p></p>Mahiru's real smile, the mellow one that she always showed him at home.
        <p></p>There was a tenderness to her gaze, as she waved her hand slightly and slowly
        <p></p>mouthed "Do your best!" at him.
        <p></p>She didn't say it out loud, but Amane imagined he could hear it, and it was too much
        <p></p>for him. He couldn't stand to look at her and turned away.
        <p></p>His mistake was turning to face Itsuki.
        <p></p>"Feeling fired up now?"
        <p></p>"Shut up," Amane snapped back desperately. He felt completely transparent when he
        <p></p>heard Itsuki laughing in an apparent effort to break the tension.
        <p></p>"…I'm gonna die…" Amane groaned, squatting down to catch his breath. He was playing
        <p></p>basketball seriously for the first time in a long time and pouring all his energy into it.
        <p></p>His heart was pounding violently.
        <p></p>Even though he had recently started to exercise a little more, he hadn't yet fully exerted
        <p></p>himself like this and hadn't ever done such a strenuous workout. Coupled with the
        <p></p>match, Amane was extremely exhausted.
        <p></p>Amane coughed and slowly tried to get his breath back, but his heart was pounding
        <p></p>away and showed no signs of calming down.
        <p></p>During the match, he had accidentally taken a dramatic fall, so his battered body ached
        <p></p>and his breathing was ragged. He was having a really hard time.
        <p></p>Even though he had tried not to overdo it, clearly, he'd gotten carried away.
        <p></p>I feel like I looked really pathetic out there.
        <p></p>He'd fallen right in front of Mahiru. He felt depressed thinking about seeing her
        <p></p>afterward in the classroom. Far from showing her how cool he could be, the only thing
        <p></p>he'd shown off was how much of a loser he was.
        <p></p>"Amaneee, you okay?" Itsuki asked, crouching down next to his friend to take a look at
        <p></p>him. He must have seen Amane squatting off to the side while the teams shook hands.
        <p></p>"…I'm fine, but I'm definitely gonna be sore tomorrow."
        <p></p>"Ha-ha, that's because you got a late start on exercising!"
        <p></p>Amane felt a quiet gratitude toward Itsuki, who was rubbing his sore back even as he
        <p></p>teased him. He took several deep breaths, and his heart started to calm down.
        <p></p>His body was burning hot, and it hurt where he had hit the floor, but Amane didn't
        <p></p>regret playing this hard. He figured that pushing himself from time to time was a good
        <p></p>thing, even if it wasn't in his nature.
        <p></p>Amane sucked in one more big breath and decided to go cool off for a bit.
        <p></p>After gym class was over, Amane changed clothes and washed his face in the locker
        <p></p>room.
        <p></p>Lunch period was next, and everyone else headed out as soon as they finished
        <p></p>changing, complaining about being hungry, so Amane was left with a moment of
        <p></p>silence.
        <p></p>He had planned to meet Itsuki and the others in the cafeteria, but he felt awkward
        <p></p>about facing Mahiru at the moment, so he spent a long time trying to cool his face off
        <p></p>with the water. He may have gotten carried away, soaking himself all the way up to his
        <p></p>hair, but he was all damp with sweat anyway, and that was probably exactly what he
        <p></p>needed to rinse it away.
        <p></p>I can't believe I fell right in front of her.
        <p></p>Of all the places he could have fallen, he had done it dramatically, right where Mahiru
        <p></p>was standing—he remembered her expression when it happened.
        <p></p>Amane was scowling when he heard quiet footsteps approach from behind.
        <p></p>"Are you all right?"
        <p></p>It was a familiar voice, but one he would rather not have heard now. Amane slowly
        <p></p>stopped splashing his face and looked up.
        <p></p>He didn't want her to see his pitiful expression, so he bit his lip and took a deep breath.
        <p></p>Somehow resisting the urge to run away in shame, Amane combed back his wet,
        <p></p>clinging hair and turned around.
        <p></p>"What's wrong?" he asked, pretending to be calm. "You're still hanging around here?
        <p></p>Not eating lunch?"
        <p></p>He could see that for some reason, Mahiru seemed agitated.
        <p></p>"Oh, no, it's just… you fell, so I was worried if you were okay… Akazawa told me you
        <p></p>were here, so—"
        <p></p>"That Itsuki… You really don't need to worry; I just banged myself up a little bit, that's
        <p></p>all."
        <p></p>Mahiru was avoiding making eye contact as she spoke to him, and Amane got the
        <p></p>feeling that her angel mask was about to peel off, though he wasn't sure why. It was
        <p></p>perplexing.
        <p></p>She had appeared upset when he'd taken his fall in front of her, but this seemed to be
        <p></p>a different sort of agitation.
        <p></p>He tilted his head quizzically. "Shiina?"
        <p></p>"…No, it's nothing, so don't worry about it. Also, Fujimiya, that sort of behavior is
        <p></p>against the rules, so please don't do it again."
        <p></p>"What are you talking about?"
        <p></p>"Anyway, it's not allowed."
        <p></p>Once in a while, Mahiru would say something that Amane just didn't understand, and
        <p></p>this time, he was especially puzzled. Mahiru cleared her throat without answering his
        <p></p>question, pulled herself together, and stared straight at Amane.
        <p></p>"…Earlier, you were protecting us, weren't you?"
        <p></p>"You just happened to be standing there, that's all. I would have taken the hit even if it
        <p></p>hadn't been you that was there."
        <p></p>Earlier, in gym class, the girls had been poking their heads through the net that roughly
        <p></p>divided the gymnasium, so that they could better cheer on the boys. A stray ball had
        <p></p>flown perilously close to where the girls had been standing.
        <p></p>Amane had only fallen because he had just barely managed to block the ball that was
        <p></p>flying toward the opening in the net.
        <p></p>Be that as it may, he wanted absolutely no thanks for it, and he would have been
        <p></p>grateful, though bruised, if she had just let it go.
        <p></p>"It was nobody's fault but my own, so you can laugh at me if you want."
        <p></p>"That would be entirely impossible. I'm really grateful. But… that said, I wish you
        <p></p>wouldn't do such rash things."
        <p></p>"I couldn't help it."
        <p></p>Amane looked away as he dried his face with a towel. When he finished, Mahiru was
        <p></p>looking up at him with an exasperated expression.
        <p></p>"…You looked cool out there, but once we get home, let me take a good look at where
        <p></p>you fell, okay Amane?"
        <p></p>She spoke in a quiet voice that only Amane, standing at this distance, could have heard.
        <p></p>She sounded insistent, like she wasn't going to let him get away without an
        <p></p>examination. In response, Amane averted his eyes without agreeing and grumbled,
        <p></p>"I'll do no such thing."
        <p></p>Despite his attempts at protesting, when they got home, Mahiru forcibly removed his
        <p></p>shirt to tend to his injuries.
        <p></p>After she was done, Amane realized that Mahiru had coerced him into getting half
        <p></p>naked. He blushed bright red and wasn't able to make eye contact with her for a while.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 50: The Angel Drops a Bomb 
        <p></p>Exams were returned and results announced, and Amane and the other second-year
        <p></p>students reached a period of relative calm. Club activities resumed, and all they had to
        <p></p>do was prepare for Sports Day, the next upcoming event, in about three weeks' time.
        <p></p>Some students, depending on their scores, had to take supplementary lessons, as well
        <p></p>as supplementary exams for certain subjects. But Amane was in the clear, so during
        <p></p>this brief period of calm, he spent his time taking it easy.
        <p></p>Talking with Yuuta after school, Amane got a strained smile from his friend when he
        <p></p>brought the topic up.
        <p></p>"I don't actually have much down time, though," Yuuta said. "I've got club activities,
        <p></p>and I have to practice for the interscholastic athletics competition."
        <p></p>Yuuta had already become known as the ace of the track and field club in his first year,
        <p></p>and the coaches and managers had more expectations of him. He never failed to put
        <p></p>in the effort to live up to those.
        <p></p>Yuuta had once called Amane "stoic," but from Amane's perspective, that word
        <p></p>described Yuuta more than him. It was probably exactly that earnest effort that made
        <p></p>him so popular and well-liked.
        <p></p>"Oh, that's right, it's still a ways off, but the chance to show off your accomplishments
        <p></p>is coming up, huh?"
        <p></p>"Mmm. With the competitions approaching, I'm gonna need to shorten my times more,
        <p></p>but I don't mind since I like to run anyway."
        <p></p>"Will you be all right? My image of the track club is that it's pretty demanding."
        <p></p>"Maybe it is, but it's not like the club is ancient Sparta or anything. The coach knows
        <p></p>you can't get good results just by going all out every day. There's a balance to it: We
        <p></p>rest during break times, and when it's time for club activities, we work hard."
        <p></p>"Huh… sounds like it's definitely an enthusiastic club."
        <p></p>"I think it does require discipline and motivation, but if it was one of those high-energy
        <p></p>clubs with no time to rest, I probably would have quit already. If I'm just running, I can
        <p></p>do that anywhere. That's probably why Shirakawa quit."
        <p></p>"…Oh yeah, she went to the same middle school as you and Itsuki, right?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, she did. Itsuki and Shirakawa are both so different now compared to back then,
        <p></p>you'd probably be shocked."
        <p></p>Now that Yuuta mentioned it, Amane remembered hearing that Chitose's personality
        <p></p>was quite different than it had been in middle school. He hadn't known any of them at
        <p></p>that time, so it was difficult for him to imagine.
        <p></p>The only version of Itsuki and Chitose that he knew was the cheerful couple and
        <p></p>constant life of the party.
        <p></p>Their past didn't seem like a topic that they liked to discuss much, so Amane hadn't
        <p></p>probed deeply, but they must have changed considerably if it was enough for Yuuta to
        <p></p>mention.
        <p></p>Amane was curious. But on the other hand, with an expression that said he was
        <p></p>worried about upsetting Itsuki and Chitose by saying too much, Yuuta related gently,
        <p></p>"I'm not going to talk about it, but maybe they'll tell you themselves sometime."
        <p></p>Amane had no intention of forcing the information out of him, so he nodded with
        <p></p>understanding. Itsuki didn't butt into Amane's personal life, so Amane decided he
        <p></p>wouldn't go sticking his fingers into his friends' pasts, either.
        <p></p>"Going back to the topic of track and field, getting too obsessed and running
        <p></p>mindlessly only leads to injuring your muscles and tendons. For me, you know,
        <p></p>running track is important, but it's not everything in life. So I'm pretty happy with the
        <p></p>way the club does it."
        <p></p>His smile was so dazzling that Amane had to squint to look at him. Looking a little
        <p></p>embarrassed, Yuuta made an awkward face.
        <p></p>"Well, that's enough about me, right?" he said. "Let's forget about club activities for
        <p></p>now; we've got the day off."
        <p></p>"You're the one who brought it up."
        <p></p>"That's true, so all the more reason to put a pin in that. Come on, let's go home."
        <p></p>Amane laughed quietly at Yuuta, who was clearly trying to change the subject, and the
        <p></p>two of them left the classroom.
        <p></p>Itsuki and Chitose happened to not have any supplemental lessons that day and had
        <p></p>apparently left earlier to go on a date. It worked out that club activities were off for
        <p></p>the day as well, so Amane wanted to seize the chance to hang out with Yuuta. While
        <p></p>chatting casually after school for a bit, they'd decided to stop somewhere on the way
        <p></p>back home.
        <p></p>As they walked down the hallway, Amane spotted a familiar flash of gold farther down
        <p></p>the hall. He looked again, thinking to himself that it would be unusual for her to still
        <p></p>be at school, and saw that for some reason, she was holding a large quantity of
        <p></p>printouts in both arms.
        <p></p>"…What are you up to, Shiina?"
        <p></p>"Oh, Fujimiya and Kadowaki! It's unusual to see you still here at this time. Especially
        <p></p>you, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>"I could say that right back at you… What's up with those?"
        <p></p>Amane pointed at the printouts that she was struggling to hold with both hands, and
        <p></p>gave a small, wry smile.
        <p></p>"The teachers asked for students who had time to help staple together printouts for
        <p></p>next month's Sports Day. I couldn't say no… they just gave them to me."
        <p></p>"…You don't feel like you're being exploited for free labor?"
        <p></p>For better or worse, the teachers depended on Mahiru as much as the other students.
        <p></p>Amane had witnessed her getting constantly saddled with odd jobs, and this seemed
        <p></p>like one of them.
        <p></p>Mahiru was a prodigy who did well in school and at sports, but she wasn't a member
        <p></p>of any school clubs, so she was often given work from teachers who thought she had
        <p></p>an abundance of free time. They probably knew she could never turn down a favor
        <p></p>due to her kind nature.
        <p></p>"I do have time to spare, so… I'll be done with this pretty quickly. This is the last bunch
        <p></p>that I'm taking to an empty classroom, and once I've carried it all over, I just have to
        <p></p>staple them, and then I'm done."
        <p></p>"What does the school have secretaries for, then?"
        <p></p>"Well… it's fine. Despite what it looks like, I'll be done in a little over an hour."
        <p></p>"But you're talking about voluntarily giving up over an hour of your own time!"
        <p></p>Amane had some complicated feelings about Mahiru being a model student and
        <p></p>getting exploited by the teachers in situations like this. But Mahiru either didn't mind
        <p></p>or was just used to it, so Amane relaxed and gave her a weak smile.
        <p></p>"Anyway, that's why I wanted to let you know I'm going to be a little late getting home
        <p></p>today, by about an hour or so. But the sun has been setting later, too, so I'll be fine."
        <p></p>Mahiru said this like it was nothing, and Amane sighed softly.
        <p></p>"…Sorry, Kadowaki, could we push today's hangout to another day?'
        <p></p>"What a coincidence, I was just thinking that."
        <p></p>It seemed the two had been thinking the same thing.
        <p></p>Amane and Yuuta looked at each other and smiled, then casually grabbed the printouts
        <p></p>from Mahiru's hands.
        <p></p>Mahiru must not have been expecting it. She blinked several times, stunned, and
        <p></p>seemed to take a minute to understand what had happened. Then, she grabbed
        <p></p>Amane's sleeve in a panic.
        <p></p>"F-Fujimiya, give those back!"
        <p></p>"Where are you taking them?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Umm, to an open classroom on the second floor… but that's not the point!" she
        <p></p>insisted. "I was asked to do this."
        <p></p>"It's not like they have anything confidential written on them, since they gave them to
        <p></p>a student," he said. "And anyway, they didn't say you couldn't have help, did they?"
        <p></p>"Th-that's true, but… say something, please, Kadowaki!"
        <p></p>"Ah-ha-ha! Fujimiya, you can't do that," Yuuta mock-scolded. "You have to let me carry
        <p></p>half."
        <p></p>"Here ya go."
        <p></p>Smiling at Mahiru's grumpy look, Amane handed half of the papers to Kadowaki.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to realize that it was pointless to protest any further.
        <p></p>Amane could feel her reproachful eyes on him but let her gaze slide right off as he
        <p></p>headed for the classroom she had indicated.
        <p></p>"…I didn't mean to steal your time from you," Mahiru muttered.
        <p></p>"Nobody's stealing my time. I'm using it as I please."
        <p></p>Amane was doing it completely voluntarily. There was an argument to be made that
        <p></p>he felt compelled to do her this favor, but it was better than Mahiru toiling away alone.
        <p></p>Yuuta was smiling calmly and seemed to agree, so she ultimately gave up on saying
        <p></p>anything else. She glared at Amane with a tiny bit of resentment, which he pretended
        <p></p>not to notice.
        <p></p>Despite it all, Mahiru didn't stop them. He figured she probably just didn't know how
        <p></p>to respond to the favor.
        <p></p>"…You dummy."
        <p></p>She insulted him outright in an adorable way that he had never seen her do at school
        <p></p>before. Both Amane and Yuuta burst into laughter.
        <p></p>Mahiru, whose angel mask had slipped off a little bit, narrowed her eyes as she walked
        <p></p>beside the boys—
        <p></p>"So not only does she curry favor with the teachers, she's flirting with boys, too. All
        <p></p>while telling us that she's got an 'important person' or whatever."
        <p></p>"Seriously. She's such a suck-up."
        <p></p>Amane heard voices from somewhere, and he felt his body stiffen as he walked. He
        <p></p>glanced around but couldn't see any girls who might have been the voices' owners. He
        <p></p>decided they were probably somewhere behind him.
        <p></p>Beside him, Yuuta's smile didn't change, but the look in his eyes was serious. Amane
        <p></p>remembered him confessing once that he absolutely hated people who spread gossip,
        <p></p>so it didn't seem like he would be able to forgive what they just heard.
        <p></p>Even Amane was on the verge of saying something, but he knew that would just make
        <p></p>things worse, so he kept his mouth shut and peered over at Mahiru.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem to think anything of it and had on her usual calm expression, as if
        <p></p>she was accustomed to such treatment.
        <p></p>That expression made him uneasy, and without meaning to, he found himself staring
        <p></p>at Mahiru. She must have noticed, because she put on a gentle smile and said, "Thank
        <p></p>you ever so much for helping me. Let's finish this up before it gets too late, shall we?"
        <p></p>Her voice was calm and collected, and both Amane and Yuuta nodded, unable to say
        <p></p>anything further.
        <p></p>The three of them worked in awkward silence, and once they had finished the job,
        <p></p>Mahiru left for home first. After waiting a while to stagger their times, Amane headed
        <p></p>back as well.
        <p></p>When he returned to his apartment, he took a long look at Mahiru's face.
        <p></p>Her expression was the same as always, and no sign of hurt or anger darkened her
        <p></p>beautiful face. Instead, it was Amane who felt irritated as he recalled those girls'
        <p></p>words.
        <p></p>Mahiru noticed the sour look on Amane's face, and she quickly gave him a bitter smile.
        <p></p>"Are you perhaps worrying about what happened at school earlier?"
        <p></p>"…It's bothering me."
        <p></p>Of course, he was going to get angry at people who wouldn't say anything to her face
        <p></p>but snuck around in the shadows bad-mouthing her.
        <p></p>Amane sat down beside Mahiru and took another long look at her; she was smiling at
        <p></p>his behavior like she always did.
        <p></p>"That kind of stuff doesn't bother me so much. I expect that degree of gossip, actually;
        <p></p>it would be stranger not to hear it."
        <p></p>Amane was the only one who was bothered by it and by Mahiru's total, nonchalant
        <p></p>acceptance of the idea that some people hated her.
        <p></p>He knew the reason why Mahiru conducted herself as an angel, so it was surprising
        <p></p>that it didn't upset her, and his awkward expression showed it.
        <p></p>"I-is that really how it is?"
        <p></p>"It's only natural, right? It's not like everyone is going to like me, you know. It would
        <p></p>be kind of scary if a person like that existed," Mahiru said quietly and dispassionately,
        <p></p>twirling a piece of hair around her fingertip as if she was bored.
        <p></p>"I think that I make it easy for people to like me," she continued, "but I doubt that
        <p></p>works for every single person in school. It's just that all the kind voices are usually
        <p></p>louder and easier to hear. The supportive voices of kind people just help block out the
        <p></p>hate. I mean, even you didn't like me that much at first, I think."
        <p></p>"…It truly pains me to hear you say that, but…"
        <p></p>Sure, before he had gotten to know Mahiru, when he had only known her by her
        <p></p>reputation, Amane had thought of her as someone who excelled in everything and was
        <p></p>beautiful. He knew that she was desirable due to those traits.
        <p></p>But he would say he fell into the category of people who didn't particularly care much
        <p></p>for the angel, at least not on a personal level. When everything about her had seemed
        <p></p>too perfect, he'd found her almost unapproachable.
        <p></p>"Especially among the girls," Mahiru said, "there are people who act friendly on the
        <p></p>surface, when they actually hate me. Since so many people admire me, they bad-mouth
        <p></p>me to mask their own insecurities. I just try to get along with as many people as I can.
        <p></p>It makes everything easier, you see."
        <p></p>Mahiru matter-of-factly evaluated her position relative to the people who hated her.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure what he could possibly say in response.
        <p></p>He figured that girls and boys must live in different worlds, with different rules for
        <p></p>human interactions. If Mahiru was telling him this, it probably meant that there were
        <p></p>people out there who shunned her, and she had really heard them say such things
        <p></p>before.
        <p></p>He wasn't able to come up with the right words and couldn't do anything but sit there
        <p></p>uneasily. Mahiru must have noticed, because she relaxed into a smile.
        <p></p>"There are way fewer of them now, but there have always been a certain percentage
        <p></p>of people who hate me, so I'm used to it. I'm careful to conduct myself in a way that
        <p></p>reduces that number as much as possible, but it will never be zero. There are some
        <p></p>people who detest me because the majority likes me."
        <p></p>"…Isn't that painful?"
        <p></p>"Well, I'm sure I wouldn't like it very much if anyone ever said it to my face, but to date,
        <p></p>no one has made such a declaration. Besides, I'm sure that people like the ones today
        <p></p>who say they hate me aren't talking about the real me; they just resent my outward
        <p></p>appearance and social standing. There's not really anything I can do about that, so I
        <p></p>don't plan to try."
        <p></p>"That's very pragmatic…"
        <p></p>"If I wasn't pragmatic about it, I wouldn't be able to stand acting the way I do at school."
        <p></p>Mahiru, who was more disciplined than anyone Amane knew, had a quiet, thoughtful
        <p></p>look in her eyes. A small sigh escaped her lips.
        <p></p>"I am aware that, objectively, I have more attractive features than many other people,"
        <p></p>she said. "Some of it is genetic, but I also put a lot of work into my appearance. There
        <p></p>are people who find me superficial just because I value that."
        <p></p>Her words weren't an exaggeration or presumptuous in any way; they were the
        <p></p>foundation for her self-confidence.
        <p></p>Certainly, Amane was not about to deny her natural beauty, especially having seen her
        <p></p>mother, who she took after.
        <p></p>But Mahiru's charms didn't lie in the features she had inherited.
        <p></p>Her demeanor and conduct, the way she wielded her gaze and her expressions, the
        <p></p>very atmosphere that surrounded her… she had not been born with any of those
        <p></p>things, but they were what made her truly lovely. Amane thought that her remarkable
        <p></p>intelligence and personal character were more beautiful than even her outward
        <p></p>appearance.
        <p></p>…Still, she is very pretty…
        <p></p>Mahiru's willpower was so brilliant, it seemed like he would be burned by the
        <p></p>radiance. Mahiru herself seemed like she also might be scorched by that light, and it
        <p></p>was a little scary.
        <p></p>"I put a lot of effort into things you can't see on the surface, you know. That's why some
        <p></p>people who can only see the end result assume that I must be cheating somehow. And
        <p></p>their feelings of envy aren't my responsibility. Of course, if I was able to correct one
        <p></p>thing, I think it would be the way people talk about me and Kadowaki. We get along
        <p></p>well, but there's absolutely nothing romantic going on between us. People
        <p></p>misunderstand that and get jealous, which is bothersome."
        <p></p>"I… I see…"
        <p></p>"I mean, have I ever behaved like I was into him? I think he's a considerate and likeable
        <p></p>guy, but I don't have any romantic feelings toward him at all. But people start
        <p></p>speculating if I so much as talk to him, and it's annoying."
        <p></p>What seemed to really bother her was the sheer frequency of the rumors.
        <p></p>Mahiru and Yuuta, who had been transformed into idols of sorts by their schoolmates,
        <p></p>were often paired up in people's minds, since they were both role models to their
        <p></p>respective sexes.
        <p></p>In reality, they barely interacted. When Mahiru had made Amane's acquaintance, she
        <p></p>at best knew of Yuuta as a popular guy on campus but hadn't known him personally.
        <p></p>They only became friends when Amane started hanging out with him.
        <p></p>Amane had never suspected that Mahiru had any romantic feelings toward Yuuta. She
        <p></p>had always treated the "prince" of the school with impartiality.
        <p></p>"Maybe to the girls crushing on Kadowaki, it looks like he's already taken," Amane said.
        <p></p>"Most guys, if you approached them, Mahiru, would go crazy for you."
        <p></p>"Hmm, it doesn't seem like you're in that group, Amane."
        <p></p>"…Well…"
        <p></p>He was already completely infatuated, no approach necessary. He felt like nothing she
        <p></p>did would change how deep his feelings of love for her were, but he couldn't tell her
        <p></p>that.
        <p></p>Amane glanced nervously about as he tried to come up with a response, but Mahiru
        <p></p>was staring directly at him.
        <p></p>He couldn't stand the pressure, so he looked away from her, but he saw her sigh from
        <p></p>out of the corner of his eye.
        <p></p>"At any rate, Kadowaki isn't my type. Objectively, he is very handsome, and quite the
        <p></p>well-mannered gentleman, too, but… how do I put this…? In some ways, our situations
        <p></p>are similar, so I'm happy to have him as an acquaintance or friend, maybe even as
        <p></p>someone I can look to for support. But I don't feel like any of that is leading toward us
        <p></p>falling in love."
        <p></p>"…I guess when you think about it, you and Kadowaki do have some things in
        <p></p>common," Amane agreed. "Though there's not such a big difference between his public
        <p></p>and private self as there is between yours."
        <p></p>This was something that Amane had come to understand recently as he'd gotten to
        <p></p>know Yuuta better. Like her, Yuuta also tended to try to act the way that everybody
        <p></p>expected him to. However, it wasn't as obvious as when Mahiru did it, and he usually
        <p></p>let some of his real personality show through.
        <p></p>Mahiru had no choice but to act the way she did because of her family background.
        <p></p>The reason she did it and the degree to which she had to maintain the act were
        <p></p>different, so they were similar but not the same.
        <p></p>"You make it sound like I have a split personality… A-are my public and private selves
        <p></p>really that different?"
        <p></p>"They are, but how can I put this… Your true self is much cuter than your angel
        <p></p>persona. At first, well, you seemed cool and serious, but once I got to know you, I found
        <p></p>you to be an honest person who's much shier than I expected. The way you express
        <p></p>emotions with your words and actions is completely different, too, so… yeah, there's
        <p></p>a difference, you know?"
        <p></p>"Wh-who exactly do you think is making me act like this?"
        <p></p>"…That's, well, hmm. It's not on purpose."
        <p></p>It wasn't that he was doing it intentionally. It was just that Mahiru got embarrassed
        <p></p>easily whenever someone gave her an honest compliment.
        <p></p>Amane understood perfectly well that she had always been a hard worker and very
        <p></p>disciplined, so he had been trying to give her frank, genuine praise as often as he could.
        <p></p>If that brought out her bashful side, well, it was too late to do anything about that.
        <p></p>"I think it's even more wicked of you to do it not on purpose, though."
        <p></p>"You could say the same thing about yourself. You're the heartless one, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"What is that supposed to mean?"
        <p></p>"…In your case, you've been getting more and more touchy, and it's hard to deal with."
        <p></p>Mahiru especially had no room to criticize Amane. She had a talent for making people
        <p></p>blush and used it quite often. To make matters worse, she often carried out surprise
        <p></p>attacks, forcing Amane into difficult tests of willpower on a daily basis.
        <p></p>At the word "touchy," Mahiru's large eyes opened even wider, and she blinked several
        <p></p>times. Then she gasped, and her lip started trembling.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help but notice a deep red slowly staining her cheeks.
        <p></p>"I-it's not on purpose." Once she'd reached a lovely shade of cherry, Mahiru offered
        <p></p>this excuse in a wavering voice. "There are times when I do touch you on purpose, but
        <p></p>I never meant to make you uncomfortable."
        <p></p>"I have several questions about your definition of 'on purpose,' but I know that you
        <p></p>didn't really mean anything by it. You should just be careful, though, because if a girl
        <p></p>does stuff like that too often, someone could get the wrong idea."
        <p></p>"…I only do it with you."
        <p></p>"I know that, too. That's why I'm telling you."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't be certain what kind of feelings Mahiru had toward him, but he knew
        <p></p>she thought he was special, and that she liked him.
        <p></p>Still, he was a guy, and her thoughtless contact often troubled him. He thought he'd
        <p></p>appreciate it if she toned it down a little, for his sanity's sake if nothing else.
        <p></p>When he looked in Mahiru's direction, Amane noticed that her face was still very red.
        <p></p>Mahiru smacked his upper arm playfully.
        <p></p>"See? That's what I'm talking about," he protested.
        <p></p>"That time was on purpose."
        <p></p>"Okay…"
        <p></p>Mahiru gave Amane a bit of a scowl. He didn't understand what he'd done wrong. Even
        <p></p>though she was glaring at him, the expression on her face and the embarrassment in
        <p></p>her eyes made her look nothing if not adorable.
        <p></p>Amane got the feeling that if he told her she looked more cute than scary, she'd
        <p></p>probably be even angrier.
        <p></p>So, he didn't say anything at all, and Mahiru cleared her throat and straightened up.
        <p></p>"Anyway, back to what we were talking about earlier," she said. "It doesn't really bother
        <p></p>me that some girls hate me. It's a childish dream to think that everyone will always get
        <p></p>along, after all, and I know it'd only cause more problems trying to force it, so I've
        <p></p>accepted that certain people just won't like me."
        <p></p>"…Mm-hmm."
        <p></p>"This contradicts what I was saying earlier, but after pretending to be nice and acting
        <p></p>the part of the angel that everyone adores for so long, recently I've started to think
        <p></p>that maybe I've had enough."
        <p></p>"Really?"
        <p></p>Amane never expected to hear those words from Mahiru, who maintained her angelic
        <p></p>persona with such tireless consistency, and he thoughtlessly repeated her words back
        <p></p>to her.
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled faintly. "I've been thinking, maybe I don't need to be such a good girl…
        <p></p>I've always tried to keep up an act so that everyone will like me, even though I knew it
        <p></p>wouldn't work on everyone. But if I had someone who could discover the real me, and
        <p></p>really see me for who I am, I could be happy just being myself, I think."
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes wavered with a certain lonesomeness as she thought back on her past
        <p></p>self, and soon her caramel-colored eyes shone brightly.
        <p></p>"You said you wouldn't take your eyes off me, right, Amane?"
        <p></p>Anyone could have seen that the light contained joyful hope for the future. It wasn't
        <p></p>sparklingly radiant, but gentle and kind, the sort that had real warmth and affection
        <p></p>in it.
        <p></p>As she gave him a look filled with such brightness and emotion, Amane gulped loudly.
        <p></p>"…I made a promise, so…"
        <p></p>"Yes, you did."
        <p></p>Mahiru's face melted into a broad smile at Amane's affirmation. Her expression
        <p></p>seemed dazzling and vibrant, different from the calm in her eyes, and he found that he
        <p></p>couldn't look away from her.
        <p></p>As though from somewhere far away, Amane felt his heart pounding hard as he tried
        <p></p>to sear the image of her smile into his memory.
        <p></p>"So that's why I don't have to get too worked up about anything. I'm not going to go
        <p></p>out of my way to change how I act at school, and I'm not going to worry too much
        <p></p>about it, either. It's all right, because I've got someone who sees me for who I am and
        <p></p>accepts me."
        <p></p>"…I see."
        <p></p>Because Amane had discovered the real Mahiru who had been huddled up inside, and
        <p></p>he was looking at her for who she was.
        <p></p>That was what let her stay calm.
        <p></p>Overwhelming feelings of joy and love welled up inside him, tickling his chest.
        <p></p>But a small lump also formed there, blocking that feeling just a little bit.
        <p></p>"…You look sort of dissatisfied, don't you?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had noticed that something was bothering Amane and turned to him with a
        <p></p>troubled, anxious look on her face. He couldn't say for sure that it was dissatisfaction
        <p></p>he was feeling, though.
        <p></p>"N-no, it makes me happy that you've started feeling that way. I think it's a great thing.
        <p></p>But it's just, well, I've just… got some thoughts."
        <p></p>"What is it? Tell me now."
        <p></p>"Ah, no, it's—"
        <p></p>"I'm not going to get mad or anything! I can't even imagine you saying anything to hurt
        <p></p>me."
        <p></p>The pressure of her eyes staring directly at him was enough to tell him he wouldn't
        <p></p>have the chance to refuse.
        <p></p>After all, Amane had also said some things that could be misinterpreted, and knew he
        <p></p>should explain himself, but—
        <p></p>He also believed that if he put what he was feeling into words, he might be setting
        <p></p>himself up to be teased for his immature emotions.
        <p></p>"Fine. D-don't laugh, okay?"
        <p></p>There was no way that he was going to get out of telling her, so he tried to warn her
        <p></p>first, and she nodded obediently. He found it unbearable to look at her directly, so
        <p></p>Amane averted his eyes somewhat from Mahiru and opened his mouth to continue.
        <p></p>"Now, you said you wouldn't get worked up…"
        <p></p>"Right," she answered.
        <p></p>"The thing is, sometimes you let your guard down and show your real self without
        <p></p>meaning to…" He made it that far, then hesitated to say any more, but it was too late to
        <p></p>stop, so Amane took a deep breath. His lip quivered as he carried on. "…And when I
        <p></p>think about another guy seeing you like that… I dunno, it makes me feel… conflicted."
        <p></p>He paused for a moment before reaching the conclusion of that thought, because he
        <p></p>knew right away how childish he sounded.
        <p></p>He was glad that Mahiru had accepted herself and was starting to change the way she
        <p></p>thought about things, and he was happy that she had extended a hand to him, after
        <p></p>spending many years wearing the same protective shell.
        <p></p>He was also happy that she had placed her wholehearted trust in him.
        <p></p>And he was overjoyed that she seemed to be coming to feel that she could be herself,
        <p></p>without keeping up false appearances.
        <p></p>He should have had no complaints, and yet he hated the idea of Mahiru—this
        <p></p>completely ordinary, sensitive girl, who always worked hard despite difficult
        <p></p>circumstances, who got lonely with surprising ease and was bad at depending on
        <p></p>others because she tended to put on a show of courage—he hated the idea of all the
        <p></p>other students at school getting to see that girl.
        <p></p>I know that it's just possessiveness and jealousy making me feel like this.
        <p></p>But that was what he truly felt, despite knowing that she didn't belong to him and that
        <p></p>he had no right to feel the way he did.
        <p></p>"L-look, I know that this sounds presumptuous, and that you'll probably want to tell
        <p></p>me off, but—"
        <p></p>Amane pursed his lips in self-derision, marveling at how shamefully pathetic he must
        <p></p>be. Mahiru looked at him, blinking her round, cute eyes in surprise, clearly taken
        <p></p>aback. Gradually, both corners of her lips started to curve upward.
        <p></p>By the time Amane noticed, she was already grinning, and her demeanor had changed
        <p></p>to something warm and cheerful.
        <p></p>"I—I thought I told you not to laugh!"
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, sorry!"
        <p></p>When Mahiru apologized with a wide, defenseless, cherubic smile completely free of
        <p></p>any ill will, it was all Amane could do to catch his breath. He couldn't offer any further
        <p></p>complaints.
        <p></p>It was a different type from the one she'd been wearing before, an expression in her
        <p></p>eyes of pure joy and affection that surpassed anything he had seen. It left Amane
        <p></p>speechless.
        <p></p>Mahiru let her smile drop just a little bit and fixed her eyes on Amane again. "…You
        <p></p>don't have to worry, Amane, I'm not going to show anyone else the kind of faces I show
        <p></p>you. There's no way I would feel comfortable enough with people I'm not close with."
        <p></p>"I—I see."
        <p></p>Amane was understandably relieved and became keenly aware that his emotions were
        <p></p>plainly visible on his face.
        <p></p>Usually, he was better at hiding his feelings, but when it came to Mahiru, no matter
        <p></p>what he did, the things he tried to conceal showed up on the surface.
        <p></p>"…You're such a cutie, Amane," Mahiru said, while smiling like something was funny.
        <p></p>Amane bit the inside of his cheek and squeezed, keeping his facial muscles locked in
        <p></p>place. "Stop that. You're making fun of me, aren't you?"
        <p></p>"I mean it," she insisted.
        <p></p>"That's uncalled for; quit it."
        <p></p>"You quit it, stop showing me such a cute side of you."
        <p></p>"I'm going to have to challenge that. I mean, what about me could possibly be
        <p></p>considered cute? And why would you say that to a guy?"
        <p></p>As someone who prided himself on shedding all his adorable traits, Amane didn't have
        <p></p>a clue what she meant.
        <p></p>Women and children could accept the word as a compliment, but Amane was a guy
        <p></p>and had no desire to be cute, so he could only take it as simple teasing.
        <p></p>He frowned and protested with his eyes, but Mahiru let out a little giggle that told him
        <p></p>her evaluation wasn't going to waver.
        <p></p>"Everything about you is endearing."
        <p></p>"I can't trust it when a girl says that, and I don't agree."
        <p></p>"What an awful thing to say. Well, you have to understand the fact that a girl's
        <p></p>definition of cute isn't just based on appearances but is more a sign of whether she
        <p></p>finds something likable in a broader sense… That's why you're definitely cute,
        <p></p>Amane!"
        <p></p>"Guys aren't happy about being called that, you know."
        <p></p>He did not appreciate the girl he liked choosing this way to compliment him.
        <p></p>Nonetheless, he was happy about the fact that she was praising him, but Amane would
        <p></p>never call a guy like himself adorable.
        <p></p>He thought about asking her why she thought he'd be happy that she called him cute,
        <p></p>but he got the feeling that she hadn't been trying to compliment him specifically so
        <p></p>much as just to state her own opinion, so there didn't seem to be any point.
        <p></p>Amane pressed his lips together tightly and looked at Mahiru, but she was still smiling
        <p></p>joyously. If he hadn't been able to see the affection in her eyes, he probably would have
        <p></p>pinched her cheeks right then.
        <p></p>"…Is there nothing attractive about me?" Amane grumbled quietly, without meaning
        <p></p>to.
        <p></p>Mahiru stiffened up and fixed her eyes on him, which made him immediately regret
        <p></p>his words.
        <p></p>Even for a pitiful loser like Amane, begging for compliments was too much. Anyway,
        <p></p>there was no chance that Mahiru thought of him as someone who was cool when he
        <p></p>had been told by plenty of other people that he was a lazy, pathetic late bloomer.
        <p></p>Amane averted his eyes, concluding that it was a mistake to even expect such words
        <p></p>from her. But Mahiru did not look away.
        <p></p>"You are attractive."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't believe his ears when he heard these clearly enunciated words.
        <p></p>"To be honest, you are cute, but you're also cool. More than anyone else, in my eyes."
        <p></p>"…You don't have to force yourself to flatter me."
        <p></p>"How rude. What would I get out of lying to you? I'm just saying what I think."
        <p></p>"…You're overstating it, and you have no taste in men."
        <p></p>Amane was working on becoming a better version of himself, but he didn't think he
        <p></p>was especially desirable. So even when Mahiru praised him, he couldn't let himself
        <p></p>believe her. Especially after she went on and on about how he was cute.
        <p></p>"So what is your definition of 'cool,' Amane?"
        <p></p>Amane was frowning, and Mahiru gently gazed at him.
        <p></p>"For me, I think to view a guy as charming, you need to take everything about his
        <p></p>personality into account, from the aura around him, to how he carries himself, to his
        <p></p>words, actions, and expressions. Thinking that attractiveness is only a matter of
        <p></p>appearance seems very superficial to me."
        <p></p>"W-well, that's true, but—"
        <p></p>"Looking at you objectively, I wouldn't say you're handsome enough to captivate
        <p></p>everyone who looks at you. But your face is well-proportioned, and like I said before,
        <p></p>appearances aren't the only thing that make someone appealing. You're maybe a little
        <p></p>sarcastic, but you're always polite, and you're well-mannered and gentlemanly and
        <p></p>kind. You're always reaching out to those in need even though you put on a show of
        <p></p>being cold and distant. You're cautious, but you're dependable when you need to be.
        <p></p>Looking at you all together, you are attractive, Amane. Of course, I can't deny that my
        <p></p>subjective opinion and personal preferences factor into that assessment, but you're
        <p></p>very cool, so please have a little more confidence."
        <p></p>"Th-that's enough, I get it, I hear you, so—"
        <p></p>"You don't get it. You don't have any self-confidence, so if I don't get serious and tell
        <p></p>you—"
        <p></p>"I said that's enough!"
        <p></p>Mahiru had gotten more insistent as she spoke, and before she even finished, Amane
        <p></p>had found himself groaning with embarrassment. If Mahiru flattered him any further,
        <p></p>he felt like he would burst into tears of shame, so he had to do something to stop her
        <p></p>from continuing to list his various merits. He took a deep breath to try to somehow
        <p></p>calm his heart, which was sending heat radiating up to his face, as if he wasn't
        <p></p>embarrassed enough already. He felt like his cheeks probably looked as red as ripe
        <p></p>apples, and that even Mahiru, who had just been praising him, would find it pathetic.
        <p></p>The fact that Mahiru held Amane in high regard had somehow sunk in—it was clear
        <p></p>to him, so he didn't need her to continue in any more detail. Her compliments only
        <p></p>made him heartsick. He felt such joy and shame at the idea that she valued him at all
        <p></p>that he couldn't stand to be there any longer. He wanted to run away.
        <p></p>Amane's eyes darted around as he desperately tried to shake off the heat and
        <p></p>humiliation that had overtaken his body.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked at him and smiled broadly, obviously delighted. "…That is what's so cute
        <p></p>about you, Amane."
        <p></p>It was a little late, but Amane finally understood what Mahiru was trying to say. He
        <p></p>glared at her; his face still flushed red.
        <p></p>"If you try to say anything more, I'll have to stop you somehow."
        <p></p>"…Oh, and how will you do that?"
        <p></p>"What do you mean, how? I'll manage, I'm sure."
        <p></p>"Well, you don't scare me one bit."
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't look like she was going to restrain herself. Still smiling, she gently
        <p></p>reached out toward Amane's face.
        <p></p>He could feel Mahiru's chilly fingers pressingagainst his feverish cheeks. Gently, she
        <p></p>turned his face so that he was looking directly at her.
        <p></p>"…No matter what you say, even if you don't think it's true, to me, you are attractive,
        <p></p>Amane. You don't have to worry about it; I can see all the best parts of you."
        <p></p>She was very close to him, and her voice was bright like the rays of the spring sun,
        <p></p>refreshing and clear. Her words slowly caressed his heart as she softly praised him.
        <p></p>The warmth and affection in her caramel-colored eyes took his breath away, as they
        <p></p>reflected him and him alone.
        <p></p>…I can't…
        <p></p>Amane felt a heat that he'd never experienced before. He couldn't so much as manage
        <p></p>a groan, or even to avert his eyes. He just stood there, basking in Mahiru's radiance.
        <p></p>Then, suddenly, Mahiru's smile changed to something much softer.
        <p></p>"You're adorable."
        <p></p>The moment he heard her sweetly whisper, a pleasant tingle ran up his spine, and the
        <p></p>warmth heating Amane's whole body grew even stronger under Mahiru's gaze.
        <p></p>Before he realized it, he had grasped her delicate fingers and taken them off his cheek,
        <p></p>and in a single, smooth movement, had pressed Mahiru against the back of the couch,
        <p></p>bringing his face very close to hers.
        <p></p>There was only a palm's breadth of distance between them.
        <p></p>Amane had kept his word, closing Mahiru's mouth shut with his hand against her lips
        <p></p>as he stared down at her.
        <p></p>The caramel-colored eyes peeking through long eyelashes that almost looked like a
        <p></p>hazy curtain were open wide in surprise.
        <p></p>That was close, Amane thought.
        <p></p>If she had looked at him with those eyes, if she had stirred him up any further, he might
        <p></p>have lost all restraint for a moment. If he didn't exert the small amount of self-control
        <p></p>he had in order to stop her, they both would have given up their first kiss.
        <p></p>As much as he would have liked to keep going and gradually chip away at those "firsts,"
        <p></p>Amane was brought back to reality by the urgent alarm bells of reason ringing in his
        <p></p>head. He was grateful that he had chosen a course of action that he wouldn't regret
        <p></p>later.
        <p></p>Mahiru, who had been calm and collected until a moment prior, stiffened when he
        <p></p>touched her lips, and a light crimson color spread over her cheeks in an instant.
        <p></p>Amane smirked when he saw that she hadn't gotten any better at dealing with sudden
        <p></p>surprises. Slowly, he lifted his hand from her lips.
        <p></p>They were still close enough that if he'd wiggled his fingers a little, they'd have
        <p></p>brushed her face, but instead of pulling back a little, he slowly put his lips near her ear
        <p></p>and whispered, "…If you say something like that again, I'll pull my hand away, and
        <p></p>really shut your mouth."
        <p></p>Though he couldn't see her face, Amane could feel Mahiru shudder.
        <p></p>However, she didn't push him away or try to block him. Feeling relieved, Amane
        <p></p>gradually backed away. He was suddenly embarrassed at how much he wanted to see
        <p></p>Mahiru's face, and he guiltily looked away.
        <p></p>In fact, he was already feeling intensely ashamed over his sudden, reckless boldness,
        <p></p>and he moved to rise from the sofa. He knew that he wasn't thinking straight, and that
        <p></p>what he needed was to get some actual, physical distance from her for a moment.
        <p></p>But when he started to stand, he felt some resistance. He looked down to where he felt
        <p></p>something pulling on him, then the next moment, a sweet smell filled his nose.
        <p></p>In the blink of an eye, threads of shimmering gold danced past him, and he felt
        <p></p>something soft graze one of his still-flushed cheeks.
        <p></p>Then he heard the sound of slippers on the floor and the echo of footsteps that were
        <p></p>wilder and more restless than they were nimble. Mahiru was gone, and it was like
        <p></p>everything he had just felt had been an illusion.
        <p></p>He recognized the bang of his front door slamming shut, and Amane brought his hand
        <p></p>to the cheek where something soft had touched it.
        <p></p>"—Why?" he mumbled, but naturally there was no answer.
        <p></p>Sapped of all energy, spirit, and composure, Amane sunk down into the sofa and stared
        <p></p>down the hallway where the flaxen whirlwind had disappeared.
        <p></p>Mahiru did not return to Amane's apartment for the rest of the day
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 51: Pretending Not to See, Pretending Not to Know 
        <p></p>What was it that had touched his cheek?
        <p></p>After it happened, Mahiru did not return to Amane's apartment. He did not see her for
        <p></p>the rest of the day. Except for when he was sleeping—to be accurate, he had been too
        <p></p>distressed for to sleep, but he'd dozed off a few times—any time he wasn't, he was
        <p></p>turning over Mahiru's actions in his mind.
        <p></p>It had only been for a moment, brief enough to make him question whether it had been
        <p></p>his imagination—but something soft had definitely grazed his cheek. Knowing how
        <p></p>close she'd been to him at the time, and remembering the feel of it, Amane could guess
        <p></p>what Mahiru had done. But that didn't mean he understood it.
        <p></p>No one would ever have imagined it, that Mahiru herself would kiss him, even if it was
        <p></p>just his cheek.
        <p></p>…Why?
        <p></p>Typically, a kiss is something only shared with someone close or important. Amane
        <p></p>wanted to tell Mahiru how precious she was to him, but his last attempt had gone so
        <p></p>poorly that he was embarrassed just thinking about it.
        <p></p>There was really no excuse—he hadn't even tried to make a move. However, Mahiru
        <p></p>was different. Even if it was only his cheek, she had really kissed him.
        <p></p>He understood that she cared about him, liked him even, and treated him well. But
        <p></p>confronted with her feelings in the form of a kiss, Amane was left more bewildered
        <p></p>than elated.
        <p></p>I wonder if she's starting to really like me?
        <p></p>Amane felt like he'd never gotten the chance to really impress her, like she'd only ever
        <p></p>seen what a worthless person he was. He couldn't think of any reason why she would
        <p></p>like him.
        <p></p>The notion that nobody could ever fall for him, and that he was an arrogant fool for
        <p></p>hoping, spun round and round in Amane's head, making it hard to think about
        <p></p>anything else.
        <p></p>At school, he kept his mess of emotions from showing on his face, but inside, he was
        <p></p>miserably distressed.
        <p></p>Whenever Mahiru made eye contact with Amane during school, she would turn her
        <p></p>gaze away subtly, so he also avoided looking in her direction.
        <p></p>Nevertheless, Amane's eyes followed Mahiru whenever possible, and the everperceptive Itsuki must have noticed the small distance that had opened between
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Did the two of you get into a fight?" Itsuki asked over lunch.
        <p></p>"Huh? You had a fight, Fujimiya?" Yuuta asked.
        <p></p>Chitose and Mahiru weren't joining them that day, so the three boys were having lunch
        <p></p>together.
        <p></p>"No, we're not fighting, but… well, um, something, some things happened…"
        <p></p>He mumbled those words and avoided going into detail. Amane couldn't possibly
        <p></p>explain that he had completely failed to kiss Mahiru, and that she had kissed him on
        <p></p>the cheek instead.
        <p></p>Itsuki did not hide his exasperation. He gave Amane a look that said, "You better give
        <p></p>up and confess everything if you know what's good for you."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't meet his friend's gaze. "Anyway…," he muttered, "some things
        <p></p>happened, and we're both feeling self-conscious about it, or like…"
        <p></p>"Unbelievable, just how much of a wuss are you?"
        <p></p>"Shut up, man."
        <p></p>"Now, now, Fujimiya strikes me as the cautious type," Yuuta interjected. "I doubt he
        <p></p>can make an approach without a painfully obvious signal telling him to go for it."
        <p></p>"That's what I mean; he always chickens out!"
        <p></p>There was no way Itsuki and Yuuta could understand what had happened, but the two
        <p></p>of them didn't hold back, and their accusations at Amane for "chickening out" stung
        <p></p>quite a bit.
        <p></p>"…It's just, the idea of someone liking me—like, if I was more self-confident, this
        <p></p>wouldn't be so hard, and… If I was better-looking, I would feel more confident, but…"
        <p></p>"Fujimiya, if anything, you're a high-quality guy who acts like a loser despite
        <p></p>everything you've got going for you."
        <p></p>"I don't know what to do with that, coming from you, Kadowaki, the cre me de la
        <p></p>cre me."
        <p></p>If Amane had been as accomplished as Yuuta, and had good looks to boot, he wouldn't
        <p></p>have struggled so much. He might have been able to accept Mahiru's affection without
        <p></p>a second thought and confess his feelings for her. He would have been able to stand
        <p></p>proudly by her side, without having to work for it.
        <p></p>He understood that Mahiru had been sincere when she'd said that he was attractive,
        <p></p>but objective and subjective opinions were two very different things.
        <p></p>Mahiru's subjective opinion was the most important, of course, but when he thought
        <p></p>about all their peers watching, as well as his own self-worth, he felt like he had a lot of
        <p></p>improvement left to make.
        <p></p>"I'm not saying that I'm jealous of your looks, Kadowaki, but if I had those going for
        <p></p>me, I'm sure I would be more confident."
        <p></p>Amane's hesitation and anxiety were his own fault. It was the fear of reaching out to
        <p></p>her that kept him stuck, worrying over answers that he might never even get, all
        <p></p>because he lacked any kind of mental fortitude.
        <p></p>"It's a little late, but you need to have some faith in yourself and make a move!"
        <p></p>"I told you, I'm working on it now. I'm gonna make a move soon, but…"
        <p></p>Amane was working on building up his confidence. He was working hard in school by
        <p></p>being diligent with his studies so that he could maintain his position in the top ten.
        <p></p>Amane had a good memory and learned new things easily, so he counted himself lucky
        <p></p>that he could keep up his grades without working too hard. After that, he just had to
        <p></p>keep raising the bar.
        <p></p>The problem was going to be exercise.
        <p></p>Amane wished he had some sort of athletic prowess, like Yuuta for example. But he
        <p></p>was just average. If anything, he was a bit of a bookworm, so he wasn't expecting to
        <p></p>accomplish anything amazing.
        <p></p>He'd been exercising in order to look better, even just a little, and to improve his health
        <p></p>and self-confidence. However, he had been focusing on physical fitness and not doing
        <p></p>the sort of training that one needed to excel at any particular sport.
        <p></p>Amane was feeling down about himself, musing that if only he were a bit more athletic,
        <p></p>he might be able to play a more active role in the following month's Sports Day events.
        <p></p>"Leaving aside what just happened, I'm going to do my best and proceed at my own
        <p></p>pace, so please don't rush me too much."
        <p></p>"Okay, if that's what you really want," Yuuta agreed. "But… we're getting impatient
        <p></p>watching you, you know."
        <p></p>Itsuki grinned. "Speaking of which, when do we convene the next meeting of the 'kick
        <p></p>Amane's butt into gear' club?"
        <p></p>Amane's cheek twitched at the idea that the two of them were planning something.
        <p></p>"Seriously, what have you guys got up your sleeves?"
        <p></p>Yuuta only shrugged and smiled and said uneasily, "Look, we just mean that we're
        <p></p>rooting for you, so…"
        <p></p>Amane spent the whole day at school worrying about the true meaning behind
        <p></p>Mahiru's kiss. Then, after heading home, he waited for her in his apartment, growing
        <p></p>ever more anxious.
        <p></p>Mahiru had responded as soon as he messaged her asking if she was coming over, so
        <p></p>he knew she was on her way, but Amane felt quite nervous about it.
        <p></p>It would be their first time talking since the events of the day before, and the strain
        <p></p>was making Amane's heart and stomach ache.
        <p></p>He was practically writhing in pain on the sofa, too focused on the sound of the ticking
        <p></p>clock as he waited for her, when he finally heard the lock in his front door turn.
        <p></p>Amane felt himself jump at the noise, but he knew that if he showed any agitation,
        <p></p>Mahiru would get agitated, too. They wouldn't be able to talk, so he did what he could
        <p></p>to suppress his nervousness. Taking deep breaths, Amane waited for her to approach,
        <p></p>and eventually, she appeared before him.
        <p></p>Though he felt somewhat hesitant, he looked up and saw Mahiru, who had changed
        <p></p>into her regular clothes, standing there as always… no, standing there with slightly
        <p></p>pink cheeks, as her eyes darted around nervously.
        <p></p>"…Um, I'm sorry about yesterday," she said. "About leaving before dinner."
        <p></p>"Oh, no, I'm not worried about that, so…," he answered awkwardly.
        <p></p>With stiff movements, like a machine that needed oil, Mahiru took a seat beside him
        <p></p>on the sofa.
        <p></p>Even though she sat next to him like usual, he noticed that she was sitting on the very
        <p></p>edge of the couch, as if trying to keep her distance from Amane, and hugging a cushion.
        <p></p>She looked as uncomfortable as he felt.
        <p></p>It was a little lonely to have her so far away after he'd gotten used to her sitting right
        <p></p>beside him, but on the other hand, he felt relieved to have some distance between
        <p></p>them.
        <p></p>"So about that thing… the thing that happened yesterday…"
        <p></p>After a brief silence, Mahiru broached the topic hesitantly, shaking so much that her
        <p></p>long flaxen hair formed undulating waves of gold.
        <p></p>"…Uhh, M-Mahiru… why, why did you do that?"
        <p></p>Amane knew he was being vague, but he was too nervous to ask the question he really
        <p></p>wanted to ask, so he tried to probe indirectly.
        <p></p>In response to Amane's timid inquiry, Mahiru pursed her lips and looked at him. Her
        <p></p>eyes were cloudy, and she looked dissatisfied, and then began to speak slowly.
        <p></p>"I—I just got caught up in the moment. Or maybe… it was revenge."
        <p></p>"Revenge?"
        <p></p>"I mean, you're the one who started it, aren't you?"
        <p></p>"A-ah, well, maybe that's true, but…"
        <p></p>The big difference was that he hadn't gone all the way, whereas Mahiru had actually
        <p></p>kissed him. But Amane was worried she might retreat if he pointed that out, so he
        <p></p>swallowed his words.
        <p></p>"Well then, I had the right to do it, too, didn't I?"
        <p></p>"…That's not the issue. Um…"
        <p></p>Are you glad that you kissed me, even if it was on the cheek?
        <p></p>If he could only have asked her directly, his worries would have ended right there.
        <p></p>He knew for certain that Mahiru hadn't avoided the… thing he'd almost done. That she
        <p></p>didn't hate the thought of kissing him, either.
        <p></p>The only piece of information missing was how she really felt about it.
        <p></p>It was not impossible for Amane to guess what the answer might be. Only, he was
        <p></p>afraid of outright rejection and couldn't bring himself to ask.
        <p></p>I'm so pathetic.
        <p></p>As Amane groaned to himself about how sad and hopeless he felt, he noticed that
        <p></p>Mahiru was blushing faintly. She saw him looking and stared right back at him.
        <p></p>"What is it?" she asked.
        <p></p>"…Nothing," was his only response.
        <p></p>Then Amane turned away so that he couldn't see her anymore.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 52: Sports Day Preparations and New Friends 
        <p></p>"Aww, I'm on the red team!" Chitose whined mournfully when she saw the
        <p></p>announcement about the upcoming Sports Day.
        <p></p>Itsuki had already seen the results and knew that he had been assigned the white
        <p></p>team, making them opponents for once. "If they're going to the trouble of dividing us
        <p></p>up, they could have at least put us on the teams that match our names…" He groaned.
        <p></p>"Either way, you'd still be on different teams," Yuuta reminded him.
        <p></p>Itsuki's surname was Akazawa, which contained the character for red, and Chitose's
        <p></p>was Shirakawa, which contained the character for white. At school, they were
        <p></p>sometimes called the "red and white couple."
        <p></p>"That's true… it's really tragic… a forbidden love, two people drawn to each other
        <p></p>despite being on opposing sides…"
        <p></p>Not bothering to hide his exasperation at the two who were lamenting their fates as
        <p></p>yet another way to flirt with each other, Amane gazed at the paper that showed how
        <p></p>the students were divided up.
        <p></p>Amane was on the red team with Yuuta and Chitose, while Itsuki and Mahiru had been
        <p></p>assigned to the white team. Although that meant Amane would be with the track and
        <p></p>field ace, it appeared that the opposing side included more members from the school
        <p></p>sports clubs overall.
        <p></p>Amane didn't particularly care whether his team won or lost, but he did want to put
        <p></p>on a good show for Mahiru.
        <p></p>"What events do you want, Amane?" Itsuki asked when he'd finished flirting with
        <p></p>Chitose.
        <p></p>He and Chitose were on the class's Sports Day executive committee together. It was
        <p></p>exactly the sort of thing that a popular, energetic guy like Itsuki would sign up for. He
        <p></p>was famous for avoiding putting too much effort into anything, which confused Amane
        <p></p>as to why his friend took on so many class leadership roles.
        <p></p>"What events are there, again?"
        <p></p>"The events left are the sprints, relays, obstacle course, scavenger hunt, three-legged
        <p></p>race, ball toss, and tug-of-war. I'm guessing the interclass relay isn't of much interest
        <p></p>to a member of the 'go-home club' like you."
        <p></p>"I guess the ball toss would be good."
        <p></p>"Of course you'd go for the most boring one… Well, just remember you have to do at
        <p></p>least two activities."
        <p></p>"All right, I want the ball toss and the scavenger hunt."
        <p></p>He didn't want to embarrass himself in front of Mahiru, and Amane had a feeling that
        <p></p>the relays and the sprints would be dominated by the members of the athletic clubs.
        <p></p>Itsuki, who he would normally pair up with for the three-legged race, was on the
        <p></p>opposing team, and although Amane had Yuuta, he didn't have the confidence that he
        <p></p>could keep up with him, given his strength and speed.
        <p></p>So he chose the easier events, and Itsuki put on a bitter smile.
        <p></p>"You're really going for the boring ones, huh…? But you know, depending on what
        <p></p>happens, the scavenger hunt race might be really exciting."
        <p></p>"Well, I don't do a lot of running, so…"
        <p></p>"You never change!"
        <p></p>Amane wanted to avoid any direct competition against the sports clubs and figured
        <p></p>participating in the games meant for the students in the cultural clubs was the safest
        <p></p>option.
        <p></p>"The problem is the cavalry battle with all the guys…," he said. "You're on the opposing
        <p></p>team, after all."
        <p></p>The only guys in his class who Amane was especially good friends with were Itsuki
        <p></p>and Yuuta. He figured that Yuuta might let him join his team out of pity, but even if he
        <p></p>did, Amane suspected that he would end up feeling a little isolated.
        <p></p>Since most boys would form teams with their friends, Amane, who prided himself on
        <p></p>being a wallflower, usually wasn't enthusiastic about Sports Day.
        <p></p>"Ah, if that's the problem, you should be fine."
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"Yuuta, Kazu, and Makoto said they wanted you to join them. There, speak of the
        <p></p>devils…"
        <p></p>When Amane looked to where Itsuki was pointing, he saw three boys waving their
        <p></p>hands at him. It was Kadowaki and two other boys he seldom talked to.
        <p></p>Still, Amane knew of them. They were good friends of Yuuta's, and he'd pointed them
        <p></p>out once with a smile, telling Amane, "Now that we hang out, I want you to get to know
        <p></p>my buddies."
        <p></p>One of them, the one Itsuki had called Kazu, was a serious-looking guy who was in the
        <p></p>track and field club with Yuuta, and he specialized in long-distance running. His full
        <p></p>name was Kazuya Hiiragi.
        <p></p>The other boy was Makoto Kokonoe. He had a comparatively small build and,
        <p></p>according to the girls, something of a fickle nature.
        <p></p>When Yuuta wasn't hanging out with Amane and the others, he was with them.
        <p></p>"Hey, Fujimiya! Come over here. Let's form a cavalry battle team!" In the middle of the
        <p></p>group, Yuuta was calling him over with his usual refreshing smile.
        <p></p>Amane hesitated, but Itsuki said, "Get going," and physically pushed him from the back.
        <p></p>He stumbled up to the group, and Yuuta welcomed him with another grin.
        <p></p>"You're not teamed up with anyone yet, right, Fujimiya?" Yuuta asked. "If you want,
        <p></p>we'd like you to be in our group."
        <p></p>"That's fine by me, but what about the other two guys?"
        <p></p>"I don't mind." The first one to answer was Makoto. "Yuuta and Kazuya are both tall,
        <p></p>so height-wise, we think you'd be the best addition."
        <p></p>"Ah, I see…"
        <p></p>Makoto was probably the one who was going to ride on top of everybody's shoulders,
        <p></p>so it made sense that he was looking for three people with similar statures.
        <p></p>Amane was on the tall side, not that different from Yuuta and Kazuya when they lined
        <p></p>up next to each other. Although he was much ganglier and didn't have much in the way
        <p></p>of sturdiness and resilience like the other two did.
        <p></p>"You okay with this, Hiiragi?" Yuuta asked.
        <p></p>"Yeah, isn't that why we called him over here? And also because I'm curious about him,
        <p></p>since you said you guys are friends now."
        <p></p>"Don't worry," Yuuta assured him. "Fujimiya's a good guy."
        <p></p>Kazuya stared at Amane. "Sure, your judgment is always spot-on, Yuuta. I've got no
        <p></p>reservations. That said, since it was your idea to team up with him, I won't know how
        <p></p>I feel for sure until we spend some time together."
        <p></p>Amane smiled bleakly at the questionable statement. Kazuya was still looking him
        <p></p>over, and it made him somewhat uncomfortable. That said, since he'd just entered a
        <p></p>new social group, he expected a certain amount of scrutiny.
        <p></p>"Well, welcome aboard," Hiiragi said finally.
        <p></p>It seemed like Amane had passed muster, at least enough that they weren't going to
        <p></p>turn him away. The other boys gave him mellow smiles, and Amane also smiled and
        <p></p>responded, "Happy to join the group."
        <p></p>"So I've got a question," Makoto said. "Are you close friends with Shiina, Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>At Yuuta's suggestion, the team was having a small get-together at a fast-food
        <p></p>restaurant. As he munched on his chicken nuggets, Makoto sounded like the question
        <p></p>had just occurred to him.
        <p></p>Amane quickly stuffed his face with french fries, hoping to avoid making any
        <p></p>embarrassing expressions.
        <p></p>The four of them were at a fast-food restaurant because Yuuta had wanted to discuss
        <p></p>strategies for the cavalry battle… but his main motive was to try and develop their
        <p></p>friendship.
        <p></p>Amane had never expected someone who was still a relative stranger to ask something
        <p></p>like that.
        <p></p>He shot a glance over at Yuuta and received an innocent look, so Amane figured that
        <p></p>the question must have come purely from Makoto's observations.
        <p></p>That meant Amane would need to work hard not to let anything show on his face, if
        <p></p>he could.
        <p></p>"What makes you think that?" he asked dryly.
        <p></p>"Well, the five of you, Yuuta included, are always chatting and doing stuff together. But
        <p></p>Shiina behaves sort of differently with you than with Itsuki and Yuuta."
        <p></p>"Oh, does she? I hadn't noticed at all."
        <p></p>Kazuya looked over at Amane like he hadn't expected that answer—his eyes were
        <p></p>open wide in pure surprise. "I don't think anyone has really picked up on it, either.
        <p></p>Everyone else has just been watching your little group out of simple jealousy."
        <p></p>"That's disturbing to hear…"
        <p></p>"Well, from the way you're acting, I bet I'm right."
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure how to answer Makoto's questions. The other boy's expression
        <p></p>was practically unreadable. Amane looked over at Yuuta for help, and Yuuta gave him
        <p></p>a look that said that these guys could be trusted.
        <p></p>Amane scratched his cheek as he thought it over. Makoto seemed convinced that he
        <p></p>was right, but Amane didn't want those ideas to spread much.
        <p></p>However, Yuuta seemed like a good judge of character, and Makoto's question seemed
        <p></p>to stem from pure curiosity rather than invasive prying—he didn't seem to mean
        <p></p>anything by it.
        <p></p>"…Well, I guess you could say that we're good friends."
        <p></p>"It seems like she enjoys your attention, so I guess that must be true."
        <p></p>"…Is that what it looks like?"
        <p></p>"More or less."
        <p></p>Makoto's powers of observation were truly frightening.
        <p></p>Amane decided that, rather than clumsily dodging the question, it would invite less
        <p></p>suspicion to tell a certain amount of the truth. It was probably more believable to
        <p></p>admit to the friendship.
        <p></p>"We simply happen to live in the same neighborhood, so we had the chance to talk and
        <p></p>became friendly, that's all."
        <p></p>"And you've been friends since before our second year, right?"
        <p></p>"Well… second year was when we started hanging out together at school."
        <p></p>Naturally, Amane couldn't tell him that Mahiru was his next-door neighbor, and that
        <p></p>she came over to his apartment every day and fixed his meals. Even though his answer
        <p></p>wasn't exactly accurate, he decided there only needed to be a hint of truth to it.
        <p></p>After Amane answered, Makoto looked at Yuuta. "Did you know about this?"
        <p></p>Yuuta nodded, probably figuring that there was no need to hide it now that Amane had
        <p></p>said something.
        <p></p>Makoto sighed softly. "What the heck… What fools we were."
        <p></p>"Fools?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Oh, I'm talking about myself… Yuuta, you hid this from us, didn't you?"
        <p></p>"Indeed," Yuuta answered, "because I couldn't tell you anything until Fujimiya said
        <p></p>something first. But I didn't think for a second that you and Kazuya would spread
        <p></p>rumors."
        <p></p>"Of course not," Kazuya confirmed. "I'm not gonna go out of my way to do something
        <p></p>that will make people hate me."
        <p></p>"That honesty of yours is a virtue, Kazuya." Yuuta beamed.
        <p></p>Kazuya tilted his head in confusion—he didn't seem to understand why Yuuta was
        <p></p>complimenting him for something so basic. Amane knew then that he didn't have to
        <p></p>doubt Kazuya's good intentions.
        <p></p>He did feel like he was taking a bit of a risk by sharing all this information, but he felt
        <p></p>confident that he was opening up to decent people.
        <p></p>Amane was really impressed with Kazuya, who had a reputation of being an
        <p></p>upstanding guy. He was serious in a totally different manner from Yuuta. Amane
        <p></p>understood keenly why Kazuya was one of Yuuta's best friends.
        <p></p>Kazuya also had a very good eye for people's character. As a friend and as a companion,
        <p></p>Amane doubted he had any serious shortcomings.
        <p></p>"So in other words, it would be best if I didn't tell anyone about this, right?"
        <p></p>"Well, I don't expect you to lie, but I think it would probably be best if you could
        <p></p>pretend you don't know anyway. That said, if someone were to ask about our
        <p></p>friendship, I think they're more likely to ask Itsuki or Yuuta, rather than come to you,
        <p></p>Kazuya."
        <p></p>"You're not wrong there," Yuuta chuckled quietly. Amane felt reassured by his friend's
        <p></p>remark.
        <p></p>"Anyway, if you could do that for me, I'd be very grateful," he said. "I don't want to cause
        <p></p>problems for her, after all."
        <p></p>Amane would have preferred to cover up the whole affair, and he hoped the others
        <p></p>would keep it to themselves.
        <p></p>"I'm sure she wouldn't like it if all her friends started asking her all sorts of questions,
        <p></p>either. So I want to keep it on the down low. For her sake as well as mine."
        <p></p>Amane knew that if their secret was revealed, he would be the target of a great deal of
        <p></p>jealousy, and he was prepared for that. However, Mahiru would have to answer all
        <p></p>kinds of insensitive questions. The biggest question: Why him?
        <p></p>To their classmates, Mahiru was not just a gifted student… she was almost a divine
        <p></p>being, an object of worship in their school. There would be much confusion and plenty
        <p></p>of criticism about a member of the campus nobility associating with an ordinary
        <p></p>plebeian.
        <p></p>Their curiosity might be completely rational, but they would probably make Mahiru
        <p></p>uncomfortable all the same. He recalled her saying once that she wanted to be able to
        <p></p>choose her relationships freely. And Amane was convinced that Mahiru would get
        <p></p>angry with him for embarrassing her.
        <p></p>Since he didn't want to do anything that might upset her, he'd tried to hide their
        <p></p>friendship for as long as possible.
        <p></p>…Though I get the feeling that she wants to go public…
        <p></p>Amane had suspected that recently she'd been trying to close the distance between
        <p></p>them, little by little, but had chalked it up to his imagination.
        <p></p>"Ohh, ahh…"
        <p></p>"What is it, Kokonoe?"
        <p></p>"…Never mind, I just sort of realized something. It must be hard, man."
        <p></p>Makoto was looking at Amane with a bewildered expression. Amane could only tilt his
        <p></p>head in confusion.
        <p></p>"Yuuta, is this by any chance…?" Makoto asked vaguely.
        <p></p>"That's right." Yuuta nodded.
        <p></p>"What is?" Kazuya wondered aloud. "What are you talking about?"
        <p></p>"I don't think it would make any sense to you, Kazuya; don't worry about it," Makoto
        <p></p>insisted.
        <p></p>Kazuya didn't seem upset at his friend for brushing him off. Instead, he smiled. "In that
        <p></p>case, I guess I don't need to know." His reaction showed the depths of their trust and
        <p></p>the strength of their friendship.
        <p></p>For some reason, Yuuta and Makoto nodded knowingly. Amane wondered what the
        <p></p>two of them were thinking and wore a puzzled expression as he continued picking at
        <p></p>his french fries.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, what events did you choose for Sports Day?"
        <p></p>As she was putting leftovers from dinner, packed in Tupperware, into the fridge and
        <p></p>was about to take ice cream out of the freezer, Amane asked Mahiru this question.
        <p></p>Some time had passed since the incident with the kiss, and while things between
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru had more or less settled down, the subtle awkwardness between
        <p></p>them had yet to completely dissipate.
        <p></p>No matter what they did, the two were both still extremely conscious of what had
        <p></p>happened. There was a distance between them that hadn't been there before. They
        <p></p>were back to sitting next to each other, but with enough space that they wouldn't
        <p></p>accidentally touch.
        <p></p>The atmosphere over dinner that night was also a little tense, though still amicable.
        <p></p>Even though things between them weren't exactly strained, it was clear that they were
        <p></p>both overly conscious of each other.
        <p></p>After passing the spoon for ice cream to Amane, she looked up in an attempt to
        <p></p>remember.
        <p></p>"Let me see… I chose the relay and the scavenger hunt."
        <p></p>"Oh, same here. But instead of the relay, I asked for the ball toss."
        <p></p>Amane didn't know whether he would get his top choices, but the ball toss was
        <p></p>honestly not very popular, so he figured it was likely he would.
        <p></p>It was a little iffy whether he would get the scavenger hunt, but even if he ended up
        <p></p>with his third choice, the obstacle course, that was okay with him.
        <p></p>That event tested a competitor's sense of balance and flexibility more than pure leg
        <p></p>strength, so even though Amane was not particularly fast, he probably wouldn't drag
        <p></p>his team down.
        <p></p>"You really don't like sports, do you?"
        <p></p>"Leave it to the pros. I'm just not that athletic, is all."
        <p></p>"…If I'm not mistaken, your grades in gym are about average, right?"
        <p></p>"Unfortunately, yeah."
        <p></p>Amane imagined he'd probably have better scores in gym class if he were more
        <p></p>athletically inclined, but sadly, sports were not his forte. He wasn't so awful that he'd
        <p></p>call it a weakness—he was comfortable being simply average.
        <p></p>The notion that he might excel in sports as well as academics seemed like a dream for
        <p></p>Amane, unlike Yuuta and Mahiru, both of whom had natural talent and worked hard.
        <p></p>"…If you were to be honest, you hate Sports Day, don't you, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Well, it's not that I necessarily hate exercise, but I do hate it when it's mandatory. I
        <p></p>like exercising on my own time, by myself."
        <p></p>As they made their way back to the living room sofa, Amane recalled a bitter memory
        <p></p>of a winter marathon he had run once. It wasn't that he lacked the endurance—he
        <p></p>could run the distances they did in gym class. He simply didn't find timed races to be
        <p></p>all that interesting.
        <p></p>It felt nicer just to run, at his own pace, toward his own goals, so it made sense that he
        <p></p>wasn't a fan of structured races.
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled sadly as she watched Amane take the lid off the ice cream with a bitter
        <p></p>look on his face.
        <p></p>"It's not like I don't understand," she said sympathetically. "I also don't really enjoy
        <p></p>doing something if I've been forced to do it."
        <p></p>"Right? So that's why I'm just going to do enough to contribute."
        <p></p>Amane didn't want to slack off enough to invite any negative attention, and he knew
        <p></p>he'd feel guilty if he didn't do his part. He wasn't going to go all out, but he would at
        <p></p>least do enough to demonstrate that he was capable. Though if he ended up getting
        <p></p>the events he'd requested, he figured he wouldn't have to try particularly hard anyway.
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, too bad I won't get to see you going all out."
        <p></p>"Leave it to me, I'll show you what I can do during the ball toss… probably."
        <p></p>"Probably?"
        <p></p>"Well, it's a boring event, so I won't stand out much."
        <p></p>Now that they were in high school, Amane didn't even understand why a childish event
        <p></p>like the ball toss was kept as part of the program. Surely there were some schools
        <p></p>where it had been phased out, but their school kept it nonetheless.
        <p></p>It was probably there to give the nonathletes a chance, but even so, Amane had gotten
        <p></p>the impression that nobody got too worked up over the ball toss.
        <p></p>"You have a fairly good aim when you're throwing things, Amane. Your shooting was
        <p></p>on-target when you played basketball in the gym the other day, and I've never seen
        <p></p>you miss when you throw a tissue or something into the trash. That's just because
        <p></p>you're too lazy to get up, though." Mahiru added a quiet jab at the end.
        <p></p>All Amane could do was force a smile.
        <p></p>"Please forgive me for being so lazy, since I never miss the trash can."
        <p></p>"Well, I suppose it's fine since you're in your own home. But I'm serious, you know,
        <p></p>your aim is quite good."
        <p></p>"I guess I'm all right at throwing things. Especially stuff like darts. My mom took me
        <p></p>along with her all the time."
        <p></p>Amane's mother had dragged her son around with her to all sorts of places, and he'd
        <p></p>picked up a number of useless skills—everything from Airsoft tournaments, to white
        <p></p>water rafting, to darts matches, bowling contests, and game centers.
        <p></p>Apparently, they were finally going to come in handy, so he supposed he shouldn't call
        <p></p>them completely useless.
        <p></p>"Don't you feel like you got a special education of sorts, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Maybe, but only in the field of games."
        <p></p>"That's amazing in a way, and so is Shihoko."
        <p></p>Mahiru sounded more impressed than amazed, but Amane, as the person who'd been
        <p></p>dragged around, wasn't sure he agreed with her sentiment.
        <p></p>But it was true that he owed a lot to his mother.
        <p></p>She had packed his days with all sorts of novel experiences, and during his middle
        <p></p>school years, when he'd gone through a difficult period, that had never changed. She'd
        <p></p>always made time for him. That had really helped him through his depression.
        <p></p>Nevertheless, it had been exhausting, being pulled from one place to the next, and he
        <p></p>hadn't always appreciated it.
        <p></p>"…Well, the event is what it is, and I doubt it will be especially exciting to watch. I'll put
        <p></p>in as much effort as I need to. It's gonna be pretty boring, though," he concluded, then
        <p></p>stuck his spoon into his partially melted ice cream and scooped up a bite.
        <p></p>The rich cacao ice cream was lightly sweetened, a limited-edition flavor made for
        <p></p>convenience stores by a famous chocolate company. It was one of the more expensive
        <p></p>ice creams on the market, so Amane wanted to savor every last morsel.
        <p></p>"Do you really hate Sports Day that much?"
        <p></p>"No, I just kind of hate spending half a day outside in my gym clothes now that it's
        <p></p>gotten hot. Though I guess we'll have tents."
        <p></p>"Well, when you put it that way, I can see your point. But you'd better do your best,
        <p></p>okay?"
        <p></p>"I'll do what I have to."
        <p></p>"Geez."
        <p></p>Mahiru pouted but then her gaze was drawn to the spoon or, to be more accurate, to
        <p></p>the ice cream. Amane couldn't help but laugh.
        <p></p>Thinking that he should have bought a second one just for Mahiru, since she liked
        <p></p>sweets so much, he held the spoon up in front of her for her to try a bite. Her eyes
        <p></p>sparkled enthusiastically.
        <p></p>She's really much easier to read than she used to be, huh?
        <p></p>Chuckling quietly, Amane brought the spoon closer to Mahiru's lips, and she took the
        <p></p>spoon into her mouth without hesitation, like a kitten accepting food from the hand of
        <p></p>its owner.
        <p></p>Her eyes closed in a satisfied smile.
        <p></p>The ice cream was delicious. He could tell by her expression.
        <p></p>Amane thought so, too, but Mahiru's tongue was more sensitive than most people's.
        <p></p>She was an excellent judge when it came to a food's quality and flavor. If she said that
        <p></p>something looked tasty, she was probably right.
        <p></p>"…This is the good stuff, isn't it?"
        <p></p>"You can tell?"
        <p></p>"I mean, it's obvious from the packaging. But it's even tastier than I expected."
        <p></p>"Is it? Here."
        <p></p>When he offered her another bite, she accepted it gladly.
        <p></p>Faced with a smile warm enough to melt ice cream right out of the freezer, Amane felt
        <p></p>his face slowly heating up.
        <p></p>…Crap, I just fed her like it was the most natural thing in the world.
        <p></p>He'd been trying his best to keep a bit of distance between them, yet he'd gone and
        <p></p>done that without thinking about it.
        <p></p>He thought they were both to blame, though, since Mahiru had shown him such an
        <p></p>unguarded expression, despite how things had been between them lately. But he
        <p></p>wouldn't have expected her to be happy about being spoon-fed by some guy.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru, you can have the rest."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"I'm brewing some coffee, so I'm good. It's all yours."
        <p></p>Amane pushed the ice cream cup and spoon at Mahiru, who looked confused, and then
        <p></p>escaped to the kitchen, where he desperately shoved a filter and some coffee beans
        <p></p>into the coffee maker.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 53: Saying Goodbye to My Cowardly Self 
        <p></p>Early June—Amane's school held their Sports Day during the time of year when the
        <p></p>weather starts becoming more humid.
        <p></p>Unlike Field Day in elementary and middle school, high school Sports Day wasn't much
        <p></p>of a harmonious and happy event—if anything, it was more like an extension of their
        <p></p>usual gym class. No parents or guardians came to cheer them on.
        <p></p>Even so, it was one of the few yearly events run by the school, and a certain part of the
        <p></p>student body was always filled with excitement. Especially the underclassmen in the
        <p></p>athletic clubs, as they always eagerly embraced the opportunity to show off their
        <p></p>abilities to their upperclassmen.
        <p></p>On the other hand, most of the students who belonged to cultural clubs showed no
        <p></p>interest at all.
        <p></p>Amane, a member of the so-called "go-home club," fit best in the second group.
        <p></p>"What a pain."
        <p></p>Amane smiled secretly to himself when he heard another student in the same tent
        <p></p>with him grumble quietly.
        <p></p>Although similarly uninterested in the happenings, Amane wasn't so put off that he
        <p></p>was going to let it show. Instead, he'd chosen to maintain a composed expression.
        <p></p>Fortunately, he had been assigned to the events he'd requested and wasn't going to
        <p></p>end up running around in circles or anything. The only running around he was going
        <p></p>to be doing would be during the cavalry battle that all the boys were going to take part
        <p></p>in.
        <p></p>Yuuta, who was on the same red team as Amane and who was sitting in the tent with
        <p></p>him, gave Amane a look of surprise. "You don't seem that unhappy, Fujimiya. I thought
        <p></p>for sure you hated this stuff."
        <p></p>"Well, I got the events I wanted, and I don't have anything else to do now, so it's not so
        <p></p>bad. Though I do think that studying would be more fun."
        <p></p>"I think that's a pretty unusual opinion, I'd imagine…"
        <p></p>Kazuya had overheard them from nearby. "Seems like Fujimiya's excellent grades are
        <p></p>balanced out by not being so great at sports," he said. "Guess that's how it goes
        <p></p>sometimes."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't deny that and smiled bitterly. It was the truth, but having someone
        <p></p>else point it out gave him mixed feelings. He appreciated the compliment regarding
        <p></p>his academic abilities, but he couldn't help but long to excel in both school and sports.
        <p></p>"I've been good about following the training regimen that Kadowaki gave me, but I've
        <p></p>been thinking maybe I should put together a slightly more demanding program,"
        <p></p>Amane said.
        <p></p>"Hmm, well, the workout that we do is meant for athletes, so I think you should stick
        <p></p>with your current program, if you're just training for your health," Yuuta replied. "If
        <p></p>we lived a little closer together, I would go jogging and stuff with you, though."
        <p></p>"There's no way that I could match your speed and strength, Kadowaki."
        <p></p>"He's right," Makoto said with a weary look on his face. "Don't you remember how I
        <p></p>almost died when I went with you, Yuuta? You don't go jogging, you go running." He
        <p></p>had accompanied Yuuta on runs before.
        <p></p>Makoto wasn't one of the sports club types; he was actually a member of the
        <p></p>astronomy club. He was slim, small enough to be described as dainty, and his skin was
        <p></p>pale. He didn't look like he was capable of much exertion.
        <p></p>That said, Amane knew that dainty and small Mahiru was capable of intense exercise,
        <p></p>so the rule didn't always hold.
        <p></p>"Nah, I think Fujimiya can do it," Yuuta said. "Sounds like you didn't get that tired when
        <p></p>you used to run marathons and stuff."
        <p></p>"I've been training recently, working hard so that I don't get weak when I get older, but
        <p></p>I'm no match for a real athlete!"
        <p></p>"You are the only one who's already thinking about getting old…"
        <p></p>"You're a strange guy, Fujimiya. No, maybe I should say you're an interesting guy."
        <p></p>"Was that supposed to be a compliment?"
        <p></p>Kazuya has an honest, sincere personality, and his way of speaking is straightforward.
        <p></p>He's direct and doesn't hold back.
        <p></p>Amane had come to understand this since they started hanging out.
        <p></p>"I'm pretty sure that was supposed to be a compliment," Yuuta answered for him.
        <p></p>"In that case, thanks."
        <p></p>"Don't mention it."
        <p></p>"What are you all even talking about…?"
        <p></p>Makoto wasn't trying to hide his exasperation, but there wasn't any ridicule in his
        <p></p>words either, just simple frustration, as well as a slight tinge of genuine amusement.
        <p></p>"Now, now. Kazuya has always been a bit of an airhead," Yuuta said.
        <p></p>"I don't think I'm an airhead…"
        <p></p>"That's 'cause the person in question is the only one who can't tell. It's fine, Kazuya,
        <p></p>don't worry about it. You're perfect just the way you are."
        <p></p>"Hmph. Really?"
        <p></p>Kazuya seemed happy to accept that answer and didn't argue any further.
        <p></p>"You're okay with that…?" Amane mumbled, and looked toward the sports grounds.
        <p></p>Out on the field, students had been running the short distance races.
        <p></p>Judging from the length of the track, they were doing the hundred-meter dash. The
        <p></p>first heat seemed to have finished already, and the second one was starting to line up.
        <p></p>The next heat was a girls' group, and there were a few fast girls on the red team,
        <p></p>including a familiar face with reddish-brown hair.
        <p></p>"I thought Chitose quit the track and field club. Is she really that fast?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"Yeah, Shirakawa is really fast," Yuuta answered. "In middle school, she was a track
        <p></p>club ace, you know."
        <p></p>"Huh, really?"
        <p></p>"Mm. Though she didn't join the club in high school. She said it was a pain in the butt
        <p></p>always fighting with the upperclassmen."
        <p></p>"I guess this is where I make a joke about what caused the fights?"
        <p></p>"Well, hmm, there's kind of a story behind it… but I guess you could say she got
        <p></p>discouraged or just tired of it."
        <p></p>"…Tired?"
        <p></p>"There were issues when she started dating Itsuki. How should I explain it…? Well,
        <p></p>there was an upperclassman on the track team who also liked Itsuki, see, and on top
        <p></p>of that, Shirakawa's times were faster than theirs… It created some tension, and one
        <p></p>thing led to another, get it?"
        <p></p>"Ah, I see now."
        <p></p>The two of them were well known in their grade as a couple, but Amane had heard
        <p></p>from Itsuki that during middle school, before they'd started dating, he had pursued
        <p></p>Chitose fervently.
        <p></p>Apparently, Chitose had had a much cooler personality back then, and it had taken
        <p></p>Itsuki quite some time to convince her to go out with him.
        <p></p>It wasn't difficult to imagine the upperclassman fighting with Chitose over Itsuki once
        <p></p>she realized what was going on.
        <p></p>"She said that all the obligations of a club were annoying and decided not to join, I
        <p></p>guess. But you know, she still likes running because I often spot her running on the
        <p></p>weekends."
        <p></p>Yuuta added that they lived in the same neighborhood, then smiled and looked over
        <p></p>at Chitose, who had taken her stance for a crouching start.
        <p></p>From Amane's perspective as a near beginner, Chitose's stance seemed masterful,
        <p></p>even beautiful.
        <p></p>Her expression, seen from a distance, was not her usual carefree joking smile but a
        <p></p>sharp and serious look.
        <p></p>The sound of the start gun echoed across the grounds.
        <p></p>The moment it did, Chitose was off, sprinting faster than anyone else.
        <p></p>She ran like the wind, with a form that anyone would have agreed was lovely to watch,
        <p></p>leaving even the current members of the track and field club behind.
        <p></p>Her hair streamed behind her in soft waves as her body moved intently forward. Her
        <p></p>feet pounded the ground with surprising force as she headed for the goal, faster than
        <p></p>any of the other runners.
        <p></p>Amane watched transfixed as Chitose cut through the goal tape before he even knew
        <p></p>it.
        <p></p>Chitose, who had run the course the fastest, held up the first-place flag and looked
        <p></p>toward the red team… toward where Amane was, with a big grin.
        <p></p>Waving the flag in the air with satisfaction, she made even him feel happy to be part
        <p></p>of the team.
        <p></p>Once the hundred-meter dash was over and Chitose came back to the tent, she had her
        <p></p>chest puffed up with pride.
        <p></p>"I'm baaack! Did you see me?"
        <p></p>"We did, we did. You were fast!"
        <p></p>"Yay, thanks!"
        <p></p>"You sure were. It feels great to watch you run, Shirakawa."
        <p></p>Chitose looked very pleased to receive compliments from two current members of the
        <p></p>track and field club.
        <p></p>Even Amane offered some words of praise. "Good job, you were flying."
        <p></p>She had been so much faster than he had expected that he could scarcely believe it.
        <p></p>But Chitose didn't seem all that excited about it. She smiled in a carefree manner. "Ahh,
        <p></p>that was fun."
        <p></p>She looked more like herself, without any air of tension about her. It was completely
        <p></p>different than how she'd looked while she was running. Amane smiled in relief.
        <p></p>"But man, you're as fast as ever, Shirakawa."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, that's because training is part of my daily routine. Though I'm not as fast as
        <p></p>I was during my club days."
        <p></p>It was a surprise to hear that she had been even faster during middle school. Somehow
        <p></p>Amane had surrounded himself with people who had outstanding physical and mental
        <p></p>capabilities; it made the average Amane feel very jealous.
        <p></p>Kazuya had also attended the same middle school as Yuuta and the others, but since
        <p></p>he wasn't a member of the track and field club, he had also been surprised to see her
        <p></p>run so quickly.
        <p></p>"I've always wondered this, but how do you move so fast? I guess you don't have much
        <p></p>surface area, so that must really reduce the air resistance?"
        <p></p>"Hey, Kazu, what exactly do you mean by 'not much surface area'?"
        <p></p>"Hmm? I'm talking about your height."
        <p></p>Kazuya looked at Chitose with innocent eyes, as if to ask what else he might possibly
        <p></p>be referring to, and she frowned back at him.
        <p></p>Her expression was probably not one of anger but of embarrassment. Amane had no
        <p></p>doubt she had thought he was talking about her chest.
        <p></p>While Chitose was not as petite as Mahiru, she wasn't exactly tall, either. She was a bit
        <p></p>taller than the average girl, but not quite as tall as the other runners. On top of that,
        <p></p>she was undeniably slim, so Kazuya must have been surprised by how fast she was.
        <p></p>Amane didn't detect any ulterior motive from the way Kazuya was behaving, so
        <p></p>Chitose had just jumped to the wrong conclusion.
        <p></p>"You played yourself on that one, Shirakawa."
        <p></p>"Shut up, Mako."
        <p></p>Chitose's cheeks suddenly flushed red, and she slapped Makoto playfully on the back
        <p></p>as she sat down next to him. Amane smirked just a little, so that she wouldn't spot him.
        <p></p>Amane only needed to compete in the ball toss and scavenger hunt, which were both
        <p></p>exhibition events, as well as the cavalry battle that all the boys participated in, so he
        <p></p>had plenty of time to kill.
        <p></p>Other students who were overflowing with enthusiasm had requested more than two
        <p></p>events, but Amane didn't share their zeal. He had only picked two, plus the all-hands
        <p></p>match.
        <p></p>The ball toss was already over.
        <p></p>It wasn't an exciting game, just a matter of throwing balls into a basket that was placed
        <p></p>up high.
        <p></p>There was usually a scramble to get to the balls to toss into the basket, but there were
        <p></p>also usually plenty of balls to go around, so nobody took the event that seriously
        <p></p>anyway. It had been a peaceful contest from beginning to end.
        <p></p>It was just a matter of picking up several balls, turning around and piling them up,
        <p></p>then tossing them all in, and repeating. A simple task that didn't attract any attention.
        <p></p>But either Amane's aim was more precise, or he'd been more successful at collecting
        <p></p>the balls, because he ended up with the most in his basket at the end.
        <p></p>"You really went for the bland events, didn't you, Amane?" Chitose remarked.
        <p></p>"Oh, hush. It's about time for your shift, isn't it? Get going."
        <p></p>"Oh, right. Executive committee members sure are busy…" she grumbled as she looked
        <p></p>over her schedule, before heading for the management tent.
        <p></p>Amane wondered why she had volunteered in the first place, but it was too late to say
        <p></p>anything.
        <p></p>As Chitose jogged away, Amane checked the agenda for the day, which was posted on
        <p></p>one of the tent poles nearby.
        <p></p>The morning program would be over after a few more events. The scavenger hunt, the
        <p></p>last event that Amane was participating in as an individual, was one of them.
        <p></p>Once those were finished, everyone would break for lunch before moving on to the
        <p></p>afternoon program.
        <p></p>As far as he knew, after his event was over, he would have nothing to do until the
        <p></p>cavalry battle in the afternoon.
        <p></p>"…So that means Chitose's in charge during the scavenger hunt, I guess?"
        <p></p>Since she had gone to take her shift just then, that probably meant she would be
        <p></p>directing the remaining events. It was a safe bet that she would be judging that one as
        <p></p>well… Amane had a feeling Chitose had set it up that way on purpose.
        <p></p>He didn't know who had thought up the scavenger hunt items, but he had a hunch that
        <p></p>they were most likely weird and started to feel a little nervous.
        <p></p>Reluctantly, he headed for the assembly spot for the event. When he arrived, Mahiru
        <p></p>was already standing there quietly. She had also gotten her choice of events.
        <p></p>He didn't have any particular reason to speak to her, so Amane didn't approach her,
        <p></p>but when he made eye contact with her, she smiled faintly and nodded in greeting.
        <p></p>In public, they treated each other as strangers, but Mahiru's real smile revealed itself
        <p></p>just a little bit through her placid expression, and Amane's heart jumped in his chest.
        <p></p>He returned the greeting with a blank look on his face, but he couldn't deny feeling
        <p></p>somewhat uncomfortable.
        <p></p>As Chitose gathered the participants for the scavenger hunt and finished her duties as
        <p></p>a Sports Day administrator, she kept peeking at Amane and Mahiru, looking very
        <p></p>pleased.
        <p></p>When it was time for the event to begin, the referee—in this case, that designation
        <p></p>belonged to Chitose—entered the grounds.
        <p></p>The field was already scattered with several folded pieces of paper, and when the start
        <p></p>signal was given, all the contestants had to do was to pick up one of those slips and go
        <p></p>get the things that were written on them.
        <p></p>Unlike the other running events, the scavenger hunt was almost relaxing. The goal was
        <p></p>to have fun borrowing the necessary items, so it wasn't that serious of a race.
        <p></p>But depending on the objects, sometimes they were embarrassing to collect, and that
        <p></p>was something to watch out for.
        <p></p>"All participants, please take your places at the starting line!"
        <p></p>Chitose smartly issued instructions through a microphone. She made a great master
        <p></p>of ceremonies when she wasn't messing around. She had a cheerful personality and
        <p></p>could read the mood well. Plus, her voice was easy to hear, clear, and not too highpitched, which was ideal for making announcements.
        <p></p>Surely she wasn't going to prank them now, Amane thought, not with all the students
        <p></p>and staff watching.
        <p></p>"On your marks!" she signaled.
        <p></p>The actual starting pistol was in the hands of another official, a boy—Chitose was just
        <p></p>doing the countdown.
        <p></p>"Get set!" Chitose said, then after a pause, the sound of the gun echoed across the field.
        <p></p>No matter how many times he had heard it before, that sound nearly gave Amane a
        <p></p>heart attack. Trying not to let it show, he jogged slowly over to the pile of papers.
        <p></p>The faster contestants had already opened up their papers and read what was written
        <p></p>on them. Amane followed suit, picking up one of them and checking inside.
        <p></p>Written in meticulous handwriting were the words Someone you find beautiful.
        <p></p>Amane had predicted something like this, that they might be sent to retrieve people
        <p></p>rather than objects.
        <p></p>He wanted to make a quip about who might have come up with the idea. Fortunately,
        <p></p>even Amane would be able to clear this challenge, if only just barely.
        <p></p>He hadn't drawn a paper that said The person you like, which would have given him
        <p></p>serious trouble. Amane figured he could fulfill the challenge by finding anyone who
        <p></p>was objectively attractive.
        <p></p>In other words, someone who anyone would recognize as a beauty… He could call out
        <p></p>to Mahiru. Once Mahiru was done collecting her item, they just had to go to the goal
        <p></p>together and he could score his points as well.
        <p></p>He was sure to attract a lot of attention being with Mahiru, but he would only be
        <p></p>following his instructions. He knew that once everyone heard the item he was
        <p></p>supposed to retrieve, they would agree he made the appropriate choice.
        <p></p>With that thought in mind, Amane looked around for Mahiru, who had probably
        <p></p>already set off to find her item, when… from beside him, someone grabbed his T-shirt.
        <p></p>He felt a tug on his sleeve and turned around to see who it was.
        <p></p>His eyes fell on the person he had just been looking for, staring at him shyly.
        <p></p>"Fujimiya, you are my scavenger hunt item, so when you're finished finding yours, I'd
        <p></p>like to ask you to come with me."
        <p></p>"Huh, me?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>He had never imagined they would be each other's object.
        <p></p>In a way, it was convenient, but he had a feeling they were going to draw a lot of
        <p></p>attention—but he was already talking with Mahiru in the very center of the athletic
        <p></p>field, and they had people already watching them.
        <p></p>On the other side of the finish line, Chitose, the judge, was watching them with a grin.
        <p></p>I'll remember that later.
        <p></p>The words on the scavenger hunt slips were in Chitose's handwriting, so she had
        <p></p>probably planted a certain number of them. Amane didn't know what exactly Mahiru
        <p></p>had drawn, but since she said she specifically needed him, he was sure she had gotten
        <p></p>something nonnegotiable.
        <p></p>"Uhh… what's your item, anyway?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"It's a secret," she replied. Even though their papers were going to be read aloud after
        <p></p>they got to the goal, Mahiru wasn't going to tell him what she was looking for.
        <p></p>So Amane sighed, and they headed toward the finish line.
        <p></p>"You're my item, too, so let's hurry."
        <p></p>"…Then I should ask you, what is your item, Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"It's a secret."
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled slightly when he answered in the same way.
        <p></p>"I see, then I'm looking forward to finding out after we reach the goal," Mahiru
        <p></p>whispered, and took Amane's hand.
        <p></p>Seemingly unbothered by the noise all around them, Mahiru headed for the goal with
        <p></p>Amane in tow.
        <p></p>Amane felt a stomachache coming on, but when he saw how cheerful Mahiru was,
        <p></p>there was nothing he could do about it—he was but a coward who was madly in love.
        <p></p>A subtle sense that something was amiss washed over Amane as they ran across the
        <p></p>field. When they got to the goal, the two of them were greeted by Chitose, who seemed
        <p></p>to be in a good mood.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help but make a face when he saw her, but she didn't seem to pay it
        <p></p>any mind.
        <p></p>"What's this, a teaming up?" she marveled. "And here I thought both of you were rivals
        <p></p>in this scavenger hunt…"
        <p></p>"Chitose, you jerk, standing over here grinning like a fool. We're both each other's
        <p></p>item!"
        <p></p>"Uh-huuuh! All right then, let me confirm your items. Who's first?"
        <p></p>"Start with Fujimiya, please."
        <p></p>Amane was surprised to hear Mahiru single him out, but Chitose seemed to
        <p></p>understand why. She gestured to the paper Amane was holding, indicating that he
        <p></p>should hand it over.
        <p></p>It wasn't anything that he particularly needed to hide, so Amane readily showed her
        <p></p>the item he was looking for.
        <p></p>Chitose made a slightly disappointed face when she saw what was written.
        <p></p>But she pulled herself back together and brought her mouth to the microphone with
        <p></p>a smile. "I'm just confirming the item now. The first task for the red team was to find…
        <p></p>'someone you find beautiful'!"
        <p></p>An atmosphere of relief spread through the crowd when the item was read out.
        <p></p>Really, Mahiru had been a safe choice. As far as Amane knew, there was no one in
        <p></p>school more beautiful than her—and of course, she was the cutest in his eyes. Setting
        <p></p>aside Amane's personal opinion, though, nobody would think twice about his choice.
        <p></p>Amane had felt some animosity directed at him when he'd crossed the goal with
        <p></p>Mahiru, but it seemed to have subsided somewhat with the revelation of his object.
        <p></p>The problem lay with Mahiru's item.
        <p></p>Amane didn't know what was written on her slip of paper, but if it somehow
        <p></p>specifically indicated him, he couldn't help but feel whatever it was, it wouldn't be
        <p></p>good for his quiet student life.
        <p></p>Chitose took Mahiru's paper, blinked several times, then looked at Mahiru again.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't see the words from where he was standing, but he could see the
        <p></p>apprehension on Chitose's face. "It's okay for me to say this, right?"
        <p></p>What on earth was the prompt?
        <p></p>After seeing Chitose's reaction, it was even less clear to him now.
        <p></p>Mahiru was still wearing a gentle smile. In other words, she had no problem with
        <p></p>Chitose reading it out loud.
        <p></p>After having confirmed again, Chitose donned her usual smug grin.
        <p></p>"Okay, moving right along, they got to the goal at the same time, but anyway, the first
        <p></p>task for the white team was to find… 'someone important to you'!"
        <p></p>The moment that Chitose's voice echoed across the grounds, a commotion erupted
        <p></p>among the students.
        <p></p>Amane reflexively looked at Mahiru—she was staring right back at him, with her lightpink lips arched upward in a smile.
        <p></p>It was the smile of a child who'd just pulled off some grand prank, with a bit of
        <p></p>bashfulness mixed in.
        <p></p>Amane was certain she was peering over to gauge his reaction when he learned what
        <p></p>she was looking for.
        <p></p>That cheeky little devil…
        <p></p>Surely it would have been easy for prudent, thoughtful Mahiru to anticipate how their
        <p></p>classmates would react to her prompt. Despite that, Mahiru had selected Amane as
        <p></p>her object. She'd done it in order to bring about a change in their relationship.
        <p></p>From now on, they could never be strangers again.
        <p></p>She was looking at him with her true smile, the one she showed him at home, not the
        <p></p>beautiful, angelic smile that she always had on at school.
        <p></p>Amane grumbled, "We're definitely going to get bombarded with questions after this,"
        <p></p>and ran his hand roughly through his hair.
        <p></p>"What the hell was that, Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>Sure enough, once the morning events had ended and all the students had returned to
        <p></p>their classrooms for lunch, every boy in Amane's class crowded around his desk.
        <p></p>Mahiru, the unattainable girl they all adored, had selected Amane as her "important
        <p></p>person" in front of the whole school. Amane understood why they were upset, but
        <p></p>being suddenly pressed for answers was still quite vexing.
        <p></p>"Why were you with Shiina?! As her 'important person'?"
        <p></p>"More importantly, since when?"
        <p></p>"You were never that close, right?! You just recently started eating lunch together?!"
        <p></p>"What is it?! What is it that she likes about you?!"
        <p></p>"I can't understand it at all!"
        <p></p>Amane faced this rapid barrage of questions with a glassy look in his eyes. Honestly,
        <p></p>he had expected some manner of cross-examination, but under the scrutiny of the
        <p></p>other boys, he wasn't even going to have time to eat lunch.
        <p></p>The boys weren't the only ones reacting to the news. The girls in his class weren't
        <p></p>taking part in the interrogating, but they were shooting him looks, evaluating him,
        <p></p>seeming somewhat amused and relieved.
        <p></p>It was probably because Mahiru, the most popular girl in class, now only had eyes for
        <p></p>him. Their looks of appraisal were attempts to figure out what kind of person Mahiru
        <p></p>had given her heart to.
        <p></p>Amane, who was the focus of attention throughout the classroom, was extremely
        <p></p>uncomfortable.
        <p></p>Mahiru herself was absent—she'd gone to buy a sports drink from a vending machine.
        <p></p>Itsuki and Yuuta wore troubled smiles as they watched the energetic crowd from a
        <p></p>short distance away, and Chitose was enjoying the spectacle with some degree of
        <p></p>excitement.
        <p></p>Suppressing the urge to curse his friends for being so insensitive, Amane faced the
        <p></p>crowd, doing his best to remain composed in front of his classmates. If he wasn't going
        <p></p>to be able to run away anymore, he would have to accept his fate.
        <p></p>Besides, it wasn't like he could disregard Mahiru's feelings. He couldn't ignore the step
        <p></p>that Mahiru had taken or the hand that she had extended to him.
        <p></p>He still wasn't especially confident, but even so, he didn't want to dismiss Mahiru's
        <p></p>bravery in announcing her feelings publicly. With all that in mind, Amane slowly
        <p></p>opened his mouth to speak.
        <p></p>"I can't answer your questions if you shout them all at once," he said, "so at least ask
        <p></p>one at a time."
        <p></p>Amane figured that in any case, it would be better to tell the truth from his own mouth
        <p></p>than to have people spread rumors willy-nilly, so he steeled his nerves and looked
        <p></p>straight at them. The other boys winced.
        <p></p>They hadn't expected Amane to take a proactive stance and open up. It would probably
        <p></p>be more accurate to say they hadn't wanted to imagine it.
        <p></p>"…Since when have you been good friends with Shiina?"
        <p></p>"Since last year," Amane answered with as little enthusiasm as possible. He knew that
        <p></p>he would have to confess that he was the mystery man who was with Mahiru, a fact
        <p></p>which he had previously hidden.
        <p></p>"Huh? Ah, then tell me, the guy we heard rumors about, who was with her at the shrine
        <p></p>visit and over Golden Week, was he…?'
        <p></p>"…Me, yeah."
        <p></p>Once he admitted that, it should have been easy for his classmates to make the
        <p></p>connection between the "important person" who Mahiru had mentioned before with
        <p></p>the "important person" she had just revealed.
        <p></p>Just then, the girl who had apparently seen them on their holiday outing turned to
        <p></p>look at Amane, and he looked away uncomfortably.
        <p></p>He felt a little bummed that everyone knew he was the mystery man now, but Mahiru
        <p></p>had said that she thought he looked cool, so he was happy enough with that for now.
        <p></p>Amane keenly felt the scrutinizing looks grow more intense as he looked out over the
        <p></p>crowd of classmates with the calmest expression he could possibly muster.
        <p></p>"H-how did you become friends?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, you hardly ever interacted! But the real question is why did you pretend to be
        <p></p>strangers at first?"
        <p></p>"Well, we live in the same neighborhood, so that's how we know each other," Amane
        <p></p>explained. "And the reason why we acted like strangers was because I knew that
        <p></p>people would make a fuss just like you're doing now and probably ask a bunch of
        <p></p>prying questions."
        <p></p>There was a wave of understanding and sympathetic murmurs from the crowd when
        <p></p>he pointed that out. He hadn't said anything because he knew they would react like
        <p></p>this. Still, someone must have been unhappy with the idea of their friendship and
        <p></p>grumbled, "I don't get it…"
        <p></p>Amane didn't particularly want them to understand, so he let it go.
        <p></p>"…So, Fujimiya, you're dating Shiina?"
        <p></p>One of his classmates asked the question that was probably on everybody's mind.
        <p></p>Amane smiled calmly.
        <p></p>"We are close, and I'm confident that we're each important to the other, but we're not
        <p></p>dating. I just wish we were."
        <p></p>He wasn't going to use the word love.
        <p></p>After everything that had happened, he only wanted to say that word to the person it
        <p></p>was meant for. Truthfully, the scope of his affection for her included many feelings that
        <p></p>couldn't all be conveyed by a simple phrase. However, if he wanted to be
        <p></p>straightforward, the best way to do it was to say those words to her.
        <p></p>He felt like he was attending his own public execution, but he was at ease knowing
        <p></p>there was no need to hide anymore and that he had been able to be outwardly honest.
        <p></p>"But you said that you weren't interested in the angel."
        <p></p>"That wasn't a lie. I have no interest in any angel. Because the one I have eyes for is a
        <p></p>girl, named Mahiru Shiina."
        <p></p>The person Amane loved wasn't an angel who was brilliant in both academics and
        <p></p>sports, with an attractive face and figure, who was reserved and ladylike and
        <p></p>extremely popular. The person he loved more than anyone else was a girl who worked
        <p></p>hard, who was lonely because of her bad habit of pushing other people away, who was
        <p></p>highly wary, yet extremely vulnerable when she let her guard down—just an ordinary
        <p></p>girl, who was wonderful in a completely normal way.
        <p></p>He loved her, not as the angel, but for everything she was inside. To Amane, the
        <p></p>heavenly mask that Mahiru wore held no interest at all.
        <p></p>In response to Amane's decisive statement, one of the more assertive boys made an
        <p></p>astonished face. With his eyebrows raised, he began to open his mouth to speak.
        <p></p>"Please don't torment him too much, okay?"
        <p></p>The boy froze before he could say anything.
        <p></p>Amane's savior was the other individual at the center of the scandal—Mahiru. She had
        <p></p>just returned to the classroom holding a sports drink that was damp with condensation.
        <p></p>When she made eye contact with Amane, Mahiru smiled gently.
        <p></p>"Amane will be troubled if he's not able to eat lunch during the afternoon break."
        <p></p>Mahiru called him by his first name, something only a close friend would do. She
        <p></p>clearly had no intention of hiding their relationship any longer.
        <p></p>She showed no signs of being bothered by anyone's gawking—boys and girls alike.
        <p></p>Seeming to have run out of patience, the same assertive boy stepped toward her.
        <p></p>The crowd made way for him, sensing that he was going to speak for everybody and
        <p></p>ask the questions they all wanted the answers to. Amane's cross-examination was on
        <p></p>hold for the moment.
        <p></p>"Shiina! Is Fujimiya your 'important person'?" asked the boy.
        <p></p>"Amane is very important me, yes."
        <p></p>Mahiru had on the same gentle expression as she answered decisively.
        <p></p>The boy flinched for a second when she plastered on her flawless angel smile, but he
        <p></p>must have felt the pressure of the crowd behind him, because he continued, albeit a
        <p></p>little less forcefully.
        <p></p>"S-so then, um… does that mean that you… like him?"
        <p></p>"Supposing that I do, what would you have to say about it?"
        <p></p>"W-well, it's just… um, if you were going to fall in love… I want to know, why Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"Why Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"Ah, well, um, the idea that boring old Fujimiya is dating you, Shiina, it just feels wrong.
        <p></p>There are better guys out there!"
        <p></p>"Is that so?"
        <p></p>Amane stared off into space, anticipating trouble. He knew that the boy had
        <p></p>inadvertently just set off a land mine.
        <p></p>Mahiru hated it when Amane put himself down. She also said that she hated his
        <p></p>unfairly given poor reputation. Which meant that she hated it when other people
        <p></p>talked badly about him.
        <p></p>Amane knew that most of his classmates thought he was a very dull person. Unlike
        <p></p>when he was with Mahiru, he never really showed his true personality at school. So
        <p></p>he thought it was a fair judgment.
        <p></p>But when it came to whether Mahiru would be able to accept that appraisal, that was
        <p></p>a different matter.
        <p></p>The look on Mahiru's face did not change. It was the same angelic smile she always
        <p></p>wore at school.
        <p></p>But the tension in the air around her was palpable. There was a dangerous glint in her
        <p></p>caramel-colored eyes, faint enough that someone close to her would just barely be
        <p></p>able to make it out.
        <p></p>"Well, um—"
        <p></p>"And exactly what about him is so boring?"
        <p></p>"Ah, well—"
        <p></p>"Would you please tell me, specifically, what about him is unsatisfactory?"
        <p></p>"Like, his attitude, and his l-l-looks, and—"
        <p></p>"Do you choose who you love based on their face?
        <p></p>"N-no, but—"
        <p></p>"Do you fall in love with people based only on their physical appearance? Will you
        <p></p>select your future long-term partner based on how pretty they look?"
        <p></p>As she spoke, Mahiru was still wearing her angelic smile. Despite the friendly
        <p></p>expression, Amane could feel tension radiating off of her. He could tell that Mahiru was
        <p></p>getting angry.
        <p></p>Amane could feel the irritation even from a distance, so the boy she was staring down
        <p></p>probably felt like he was drowning in it.
        <p></p>Indeed, he seemed to have sensed that she was displeased, even as she continued
        <p></p>smiling.
        <p></p>Amane could only see the boy's back, but he could tell that his classmate was almost
        <p></p>cowering.
        <p></p>"W-well…"
        <p></p>"Actually, in the first place, I don't think you have any right to tell anyone why they can
        <p></p>or cannot fall in love with someone else."
        <p></p>The words that came from Mahiru's lips, which were still in a gentle smile, had a
        <p></p>sharpness to them that contrasted with her mild tone.
        <p></p>She was still smiling, but she was angry enough that now everyone, not just Amane,
        <p></p>could tell.
        <p></p>"I've been a little too harsh, haven't I?" she said. "My apologies."
        <p></p>Mahiru saw that her classmate had become speechless, and she finally eased up a
        <p></p>little, giving him an annoyed yet gentle smile. The boy confronting her seemed quite
        <p></p>flustered once he realized that he had made Mahiru, who was always mild-mannered
        <p></p>and cheerful, quite annoyed.
        <p></p>"I'll take the liberty to correct your statements. Amane is a kind and attractive person.
        <p></p>I also think that his quiet, warm presence is simply wonderful. Besides that, he is very
        <p></p>gentlemanly, and he always treats me with utmost respect. He's a wonderful person.
        <p></p>He supports me when I'm having a hard time and is deeply considerate of my feelings.
        <p></p>And at least he never badmouths anyone or tries to get in the way of someone else's
        <p></p>romance."
        <p></p>Those words she added at the end were the finishing blow—she had more or less
        <p></p>declared that she could never love someone like the boy who had said disparaging
        <p></p>things about Amane to her face.
        <p></p>"Is there anything more that you wish to say?"
        <p></p>With a sweet smile, she cocked her head and prompted him for a reply.
        <p></p>The classmate had obviously had enough. He shook his head, and said in a halting and
        <p></p>vanishingly small voice, "N-no, there's nothing," then backed away from Mahiru on
        <p></p>unsteady feet.
        <p></p>Free from obstructions, Mahiru's gaze landed on Amane.
        <p></p>She had basically announced her love for him in front of all their classmates, and his
        <p></p>face stiffened as he wondered how he ought to profess his feelings to her. Mahiru was
        <p></p>wearing the best smile he had seen on her yet that day.
        <p></p>It was completely different from her angelic smile—it was the sweet smile full of joy
        <p></p>that she showed him at home.
        <p></p>"Let's eat lunch together, Amane."
        <p></p>"…Yeah."
        <p></p>No more boys stepped up to interrogate him.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru really had a lot to say, huh?" Amane mumbled. He had gathered with his
        <p></p>classmates to prepare for the cavalry battle, several events after the start of the
        <p></p>afternoon program.
        <p></p>"I think it's a shame it had to happen like that," Yuuta said.
        <p></p>Amane furrowed his eyebrows at Yuuta's comment.
        <p></p>The two of them were standing some ways away from the tent because it was annoying
        <p></p>to be stared at.
        <p></p>People were still looking his way, but it was at least a little better with some distance.
        <p></p>Yuuta's words implied that Amane should have been the one to make the first move.
        <p></p>Amane had no way to refute him.
        <p></p>"I think I get it, but… were Fujimiya and Shiina really that close?" Makoto asked
        <p></p>curiously. He seemed a little suspicious of Amane and Mahiru's relationship.
        <p></p>"Mm, honestly, I wondered why they weren't already dating!" Yuuta replied. "If
        <p></p>anything, I'm impressed that Shiina was able to hold out this long."
        <p></p>"She really hid it well. Which is understandable, seeing the uproar today at lunch. That
        <p></p>was awful, huh?"
        <p></p>Makoto looked at Amane with pity.
        <p></p>Makoto and Kazuya had been in the classroom, but as one might expect, they hadn't
        <p></p>been able to speak to Amane while he was being surrounded and questioned. Amane
        <p></p>didn't mind, since he wasn't very good friends with them, but he would have
        <p></p>appreciated a little help from Itsuki or Yuuta, at least.
        <p></p>"That was really something else. Those guys looked so pathetic, but man, it felt good
        <p></p>to watch Shiina shut them all down," Kazuya remarked.
        <p></p>"They looked miserable, but I think maybe from their perspective, it was just too hard
        <p></p>to believe…"
        <p></p>"Hmm, you think so? But a guy ought to tell the girl he likes how he feels to her face,
        <p></p>right? So it's pretty difficult to pine after somebody when you're not willing to make a
        <p></p>move. Just wishing you could have whatever you want without taking any risks, and
        <p></p>then whining about it when you don't get your way… it's childish. And then to insult
        <p></p>Fujimiya on top of it all? Beyond pathetic."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help but groan. The idea that a man should confess his feelings
        <p></p>affected Amane quite deeply.
        <p></p>"Kazuya, something you said is bothering Fujimiya…"
        <p></p>"Well, from what I can see, Fujimiya was already pretty irritated."
        <p></p>"That's because Shiina expressed her feelings first, you see."
        <p></p>That much was obvious.
        <p></p>Now that things had gone so far, neither Amane nor Mahiru could avoid the truth any
        <p></p>longer. There was no question that Mahiru liked Amane.
        <p></p>However, it was clear that the kind of man who sat back without doing anything must
        <p></p>have absolutely no self-respect.
        <p></p>Since Mahiru had expressed her feelings directly, Amane knew he would have to
        <p></p>respond the same way. He'd known what he wanted to say to her for a long time
        <p></p>already; it was just a matter of how to say it.
        <p></p>"I'm planning to tell her properly after we get home. I won't say anything at school."
        <p></p>He felt he should tell her when they were alone, when he could have her all to himself.
        <p></p>Mahiru had already made a public confession, but even so, at least when it came time
        <p></p>for them to convey their feelings to each other, Amane was resolved to do it more
        <p></p>privately.
        <p></p>Kazuya turned to him with a satisfied-looking smile. "Mm, that's the spirit. But first,
        <p></p>we've got some opponents to kick around in the cavalry battle. They're definitely going
        <p></p>to come for us!"
        <p></p>For some reason, Kazuya was grinning gleefully, and Amane gave a strained smile
        <p></p>back.
        <p></p>Makoto, the one who would be riding on all their shoulders, grumbled wearily, "Don't
        <p></p>you think I've got too much responsibility here?" But he sounded more resigned than
        <p></p>upset, which was a bit of a relief. "You just follow Kazuya's example, all right, Fujimiya?
        <p></p>Really give 'em a good beating."
        <p></p>"I'll handle it."
        <p></p>Amane knew that he was supposed to be fired up and full of manly vigor, ready to fight
        <p></p>back any competitors for Mahiru's attention.
        <p></p>I'll tell her everything once we get home.
        <p></p>For that reason and more, Amane hoped he would make it through the afternoon in
        <p></p>one piece. The other three boys looked at each other and smiled.
        <p></p>"That was awful…"
        <p></p>After rinsing off what felt like a cloud of dust in the bath, Amane flopped down on the
        <p></p>sofa with the feeling of fatigue that always followed vigorous exercise.
        <p></p>Sure enough, the opposing teams had hit them hard during the cavalry battle. But it
        <p></p>wasn't a surprise that they would be particularly aggressive toward Amane's team.
        <p></p>Still, it had caused a lot of trouble for Yuuta and the others.
        <p></p>But Kazuya had gleefully exclaimed, "Now this is youth!" wearing a warlike grin, so it
        <p></p>seemed like he enjoyed that kind of fierce competition.
        <p></p>In the end, Amane's team had not been able to hold out in the face of the white team's
        <p></p>terrible attacks, but thanks to the strenuous efforts of Makoto, who had been on top,
        <p></p>they had nevertheless managed to snatch many more of the other team's headbands
        <p></p>than Amane had expected.
        <p></p>Makoto had been the one doing all the work, but Amane had seen Mahiru, watching
        <p></p>from the sideline, smiling at him.
        <p></p>Just like that, the afternoon program ended. Then came the closing ceremony, followed
        <p></p>by the customary cleanup after the event.
        <p></p>Now Amane was home.
        <p></p>In a lot of ways, the day had been too much to handle, and Amane was already
        <p></p>physically and emotionally exhausted. But it wasn't over just yet.
        <p></p>…I have to tell her.
        <p></p>Mahiru had been brave enough to make her relationship with Amane public; she had
        <p></p>chosen to associate herself with him.
        <p></p>He felt like if he failed to respond to her feelings and put off saying anything, he would
        <p></p>be a disgrace to all men.
        <p></p>I wonder how I should say it.
        <p></p>Amane had made up his mind, but he was still plagued by hesitation and indecision. It
        <p></p>was the first time in his life that he was going to earnestly confess his love for someone,
        <p></p>so undoubtedly, he was terrified.
        <p></p>He worried whether the atmosphere was romantic enough for a girl like Mahiru and
        <p></p>pondered how he should communicate his feelings so that she would be happy to hear
        <p></p>them. No answers seemed to come as the questions swirled around and around in his
        <p></p>mind.
        <p></p>Amane pressed his fingers to his forehead, thinking over the possibilities, when—
        <p></p>from the front door, he heard a key in the lock.
        <p></p>The sound made him jump because it signaled that the girl occupying his thoughts,
        <p></p>who held the spare key to his apartment, was coming to visit.
        <p></p>It was the first time that sound coming from the entryway had set his nerves on edge.
        <p></p>The door closed, and he heard it lock.
        <p></p>Then he heard the echo of slippers walking across the floor, like little breaths of air,
        <p></p>and… a familiar girl with flaxen hair appeared in the hallway.
        <p></p>"Amane."
        <p></p>Her light-pink lips were curved gently upward in a tender smile, even sweeter than
        <p></p>usual, as though she hadn't been bothered in the slightest by the uproar at school.
        <p></p>Amane felt his heartbeat quicken.
        <p></p>Whether she knew how agitated he was or not, Mahiru sat down beside him, as she
        <p></p>always did.
        <p></p>There was no more than a hand's breadth of distance between them.
        <p></p>When Mahiru straightened herself up, her hair moved in gentle waves, carrying the
        <p></p>sweet smell of her soap. Like Amane, she had taken a bath to wash off all the sweat. If
        <p></p>he looked carefully, he could see that her milky white skin was even smoother and
        <p></p>cleaner than usual.
        <p></p>Amane's whole body grew tense as Mahiru gave him a refreshing smile.
        <p></p>"Amane, I'm sure you probably have lots of things you want to say to me, and things
        <p></p>you want to ask, but… could I ask you to let me say one thing first?"
        <p></p>"S-sure?"
        <p></p>Amane put up his guard, wondering what it could be all of a sudden. Mahiru bowed
        <p></p>her head.
        <p></p>"I feel guilty for putting you on the spot and putting you through what I imagine was
        <p></p>some very unpleasant attention, Amane. I'm so sorry."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"…Well, you see," she continued uneasily, "I sort of… knew that would happen."
        <p></p>Amane understood what she had been anxious about. Mahiru knew how influential
        <p></p>she was; that was precisely why she was always so careful about the way she
        <p></p>presented herself.
        <p></p>So when Mahiru had declared in public that Amane was her "important person," it had
        <p></p>been obvious that her announcement would cause a scene, and yet she had done it
        <p></p>anyway, knowing the consequences.
        <p></p>"W-well, I more or less already figured that you knew what would happen when you
        <p></p>did it, so—"
        <p></p>"You're not angry?"
        <p></p>"I'm not."
        <p></p>"I see, thank goodness."
        <p></p>If anything, as far as Amane was concerned, he'd finally made up his mind precisely
        <p></p>because Mahiru had taken the initiative. And now he knew her level of commitment,
        <p></p>so he wasn't upset with her at all.
        <p></p>Besides, Amane had also prepared himself to confess his feelings for Mahiru.
        <p></p>He took a deep breath and stared into Mahiru's eyes. They were even clearer and
        <p></p>calmer than usual, and gentle enough to make him catch his breath.
        <p></p>"Can I apologize for something, too?" he asked.
        <p></p>"For what?"
        <p></p>"…I'm sorry I've been so cowardly."
        <p></p>Before he could tell her how he felt, there was something else he had to say.
        <p></p>"I'm sorry. I knew how you felt, and I couldn't handle it. I looked away and acted like I
        <p></p>didn't notice and pretended like I couldn't see it."
        <p></p>Amane had always vaguely suspected Mahiru had feelings for him, but he had chosen
        <p></p>to ignore them. He'd piled up the excuses, telling himself that he was so pathetic that
        <p></p>she could never love him as he was, and so on.
        <p></p>But he wasn't going to run anymore.
        <p></p>He needed to confront his feelings and Mahiru's. He wanted to tell her the unvarnished
        <p></p>truth.
        <p></p>Amane stared directly at Mahiru, bracing himself so that he wouldn't turn away this
        <p></p>time, and—Mahiru smiled a little.
        <p></p>"Well, that goes for both of us, doesn't it?" she said. "I did the same thing… I mean, if I
        <p></p>wasn't convinced of how you felt, I never could have taken a step like this."
        <p></p>Mahiru quietly reached out and touched Amane's hand. She was still wearing a faint
        <p></p>smile.
        <p></p>"I told you, didn't I?" she said. "I'm a sly one."
        <p></p>"…I don't know. I think I'm slyer."
        <p></p>Amane smiled wryly, thinking that Mahiru's kind of deviousness was awfully cute.
        <p></p>Suddenly, he pulled his hand away from Mahiru's grasp and instead wrapped both
        <p></p>arms around her and embraced her gently.
        <p></p>He felt her delicate body stiffen with surprise, but then she quickly relaxed in his arms.
        <p></p>Mahiru was leaning against his chest and looking up at him. He could see hints of
        <p></p>bewilderment and anticipation in her caramel-colored eyes.
        <p></p>"…Will you let me start?" Amane whispered.
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded, her cheeks slightly flushed, and pressed herself further into his
        <p></p>embrace.
        <p></p>"Um, so, this is my first time seriously falling for anyone. How can I put this…? I never
        <p></p>thought it would happen… I thought it was impossible."
        <p></p>"…Because of your past?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, that's right." He nodded.
        <p></p>He was still embracing Mahiru, not letting her go.
        <p></p>The reluctance that Amane had felt when it came to telling Mahiru that he loved her,
        <p></p>or recognizing that she loved him in return, could be blamed on the lasting effects of
        <p></p>an incident in middle school.
        <p></p>Amane had no confidence, so he had always been too afraid to express affection
        <p></p>toward anyone. When he'd thought about the possibility of being rejected, he had
        <p></p>decided it was better not to form any attachments.
        <p></p>That ended after he met Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Because of that, I thought that I wasn't capable of falling in love with anyone… But I
        <p></p>never expected someone to change that so easily."
        <p></p>He gazed down again at the girl in his arms. Just looking at her filled his chest with
        <p></p>warmth, and he felt like he might overflow with bashful affection.
        <p></p>Mahiru was the first and possibly the last person who would make him feel this way.
        <p></p>That was how in love he was.
        <p></p>"I've realized that people can change when they meet someone they love."
        <p></p>Amane had certainly changed since meeting Mahiru. Thanks to her, he'd finally been
        <p></p>able to start breaking free of the wall he had built around his heart and had learned to
        <p></p>accept himself bit by bit. The feeling of falling in love with someone had also given rise
        <p></p>to the desire to be loved. He had come to know the feeling of wanting to hold someone
        <p></p>in his arms and cherish them.
        <p></p>"…You know, at first, I didn't think you had much charm," he admitted.
        <p></p>"I know. You told me to my face."
        <p></p>"I'm sorry about that, really."
        <p></p>Back then, neither of them had thought too highly of the other, and he had said some
        <p></p>rude things to her. Mahiru had probably also thought that Amane was an unfriendly,
        <p></p>undisciplined loser.
        <p></p>"…You know, when we met, you wouldn't open up to me. You were so distant, but I
        <p></p>figured it was okay as long as we got along all right… But before I knew it, that wasn't
        <p></p>enough anymore."
        <p></p>When they first met, Amane hadn't wanted to get pointlessly involved with Mahiru. He
        <p></p>wondered when that had changed.
        <p></p>"I came to feel like I wanted to learn more about you. I wanted to get to know you.
        <p></p>From the bottom of my heart, I wanted to cherish you. I… wanted to be with you. That
        <p></p>was the first time I'd ever felt like that."
        <p></p>"…I see."
        <p></p>"I've been holding back this whole time. But… you told me I was enough, so I didn't
        <p></p>give up. I tried to think about what I could do to become a better person for you. But,
        <p></p>well, before I could do anything, you took the first step."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh… I was holding back too, you know. You're pretty cool, Amane, and I was
        <p></p>worried that someone else might come along and snatch you up. I was anxious about
        <p></p>whether you'd even like me or not."
        <p></p>"I think you were the only one who was worried about that."
        <p></p>"Hmm. That again…"
        <p></p>Mahiru looked unhappy when Amane put himself down again. But when she noticed
        <p></p>his expression, she blinked several times.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't wearing the pitiful face that Mahiru was always so quick to criticize.
        <p></p>Instead, his eyes were serious and had the look of someone who had prepared himself
        <p></p>to do something especially difficult.
        <p></p>"…So, from now on… I'm going to work hard, so that it's not weird when people see us
        <p></p>together."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"I'm going to become a man who does my best so that no one will tell you that we're
        <p></p>mismatched ever again… And even if I can't do it, I still want to improve enough to feel
        <p></p>proud of myself."
        <p></p>Amane wanted to become the kind of man who was worthy of standing proudly by
        <p></p>Mahiru's side, so that no one could object to their relationship. Not only for Mahiru's
        <p></p>sake, but for his own as well. And so that he could have confidence in himself.
        <p></p>The first step down that path had to start with these words.
        <p></p>"I love you, Mahiru, more than anyone else. Will you be my girlfriend?"
        <p></p>He stared into her clear, caramel-colored eyes and whispered his confession. Her
        <p></p>serene eyes glistened with tears, but not a single drop spilled down her cheeks. Amane
        <p></p>was the only thing reflected in her dewy eyes.
        <p></p>Mahiru closed her eyes and smiled.
        <p></p>"…Yes."
        <p></p>Mahiru's answer was so quiet that even if anybody else had been in the room, Amane
        <p></p>would still have been the only one to hear it. Yet her trembling voice conveyed her
        <p></p>unmistakable agreement.
        <p></p>Mahiru buried her face in Amane's chest again. Her arms wrapped tightly around his
        <p></p>back, holding him firmly in place and not letting go. It was like she was telling him that
        <p></p>she wasn't going to let him get away.
        <p></p>Feeling a little embarrassed, Amane also wrapped his arms securely around Mahiru's
        <p></p>small back.
        <p></p>—I'll never let you go.
        <p></p>I want to treasure you. I want to bring you joy. I want to love you.
        <p></p>Mahiru was the first person to make him feel that way.
        <p></p>"I want to make you happy, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"Is that a promise, Amane?"
        <p></p>Mahiru slowly lifted her face and gave Amane an impish smirk, so he smiled and
        <p></p>lowered his lips to her ear.
        <p></p>"This is my wish. So I promise, right now… I will cherish you, and make you happy,
        <p></p>absolutely," he pledged passionately.
        <p></p>"…Mm."
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded and gave Amane a sweet smile that melted his heart.

        <p></p>Chapter 54: The Day After the Confession 
        <p></p>Mahiru and I are dating.
        <p></p>If he was to put it into words, he could have summarized
        <p></p>it in that one short sentence, but Amane's heart was
        <p></p>overflowing with so much emotion that he could barely
        <p></p>string a thought together.
        <p></p>The night after the confession, after Mahiru had returned
        <p></p>to her own apartment, Amane had found himself feeling
        <p></p>restless and in a dreamy haze.
        <p></p>He shared a new bond with his first love: the girl he'd
        <p></p>fallen head over heels for. It made sense that he would be
        <p></p>ecstatic.
        <p></p>It really hadn't been that long since they'd first met—just
        <p></p>over half a year—and yet, having spent those days pining
        <p></p>away, so close to the object of his unrequited love, it had felt
        <p></p>like a very long time indeed.
        <p></p>Shortly after the beginning of the new year, Amane
        <p></p>realized he had feelings for Mahiru, meaning he had spent
        <p></p>about four months in such a state.
        <p></p>Whether it had been "just four months" or "four long
        <p></p>months" depended on perspective, but for Amane, it felt like
        <p></p>forever. The saying goes that "first love bears no fruit," but
        <p></p>in Amane and Mahiru's case, that didn't seem to apply.
        <p></p>Amane was happy that they were together now, but
        <p></p>without the slightest bit of experience, he had no idea what
        <p></p>he ought to do next. He didn't know how he should act
        <p></p>around her the following day.
        <p></p>Kept awake all night by a combination of joy and
        <p></p>apprehension, Amane was rather sleep-deprived when he
        <p></p>welcomed Mahiru into his apartment the day after they
        <p></p>confessed to each other.
        <p></p>"…Um, g-good morning."
        <p></p>Mahiru, who had come to say good morning at an hour
        <p></p>much closer to the afternoon, was wearing a big smile that
        <p></p>completely failed to hide the fact that she felt just as
        <p></p>awkward as Amane.
        <p></p>The day after Sports Day was a school holiday, so it wasn't
        <p></p>unusual for Mahiru to come over. She had visited frequently
        <p></p>before they started dating, too, so it wasn't particularly
        <p></p>strange. She was a familiar figure at home.
        <p></p>What had changed was the feeling of distance between
        <p></p>them, thanks to their new relationship. It somehow seemed
        <p></p>like they were further apart compared to before.
        <p></p>Normally, because she was so used to it, Mahiru would
        <p></p>walk through the door like it was her own house, making
        <p></p>herself at home, but…today, she seemed somehow tense.
        <p></p>However, Amane's nervousness was much worse. He
        <p></p>couldn't even muster his usual lighthearted greeting and
        <p></p>instead let his eyes wander nervously around the room as he
        <p></p>finally managed to reply in a quiet voice, "…Morning."
        <p></p>Then they both took their seats on the living room sofa,
        <p></p>leaving a wider-than-usual space between them.
        <p></p>"Um… A-Amane, you look a little sleepy."
        <p></p>"Yeah, well…how do I put this? I was so happy that I
        <p></p>couldn't really sleep," Amane mumbled, sounding flustered.
        <p></p>Mahiru's cheeks became redder, as if she knew exactly
        <p></p>what he meant. "I—I must be pretty carefree, since I slept
        <p></p>quite well, feeling happy and fortunate…"
        <p></p>"N-no, I think that's great! I just—I was thinking about all
        <p></p>sorts of things and was too worked up, like a little kid the
        <p></p>night before a field trip!"
        <p></p>"…So you're happy, too?"
        <p></p>"Well, yeah… Of course I am, now that I know the girl I
        <p></p>like feels the same way… I'm so happy that my head can't
        <p></p>stop spinning."
        <p></p>Amane had never done this sort of thing before, so he was
        <p></p>practically trembling with joy at the idea that the person he
        <p></p>liked reciprocated his feelings. However, he still had no idea
        <p></p>how he should act toward Mahiru. He was at a total loss.
        <p></p>His parents' relationship wasn't a good reference, either.
        <p></p>Amane did think the two of them got along better than
        <p></p>average, maybe even a little too well. Even though they only
        <p></p>did so inside the house, they were openly affectionate.
        <p></p>Amane felt like trying to use his parents as an example
        <p></p>would only lead to embarrassment.
        <p></p>So Amane was wrestling with the problem of how to act
        <p></p>toward his new girlfriend as he answered. Mahiru put on a
        <p></p>soft, effortless smile and started to lean on Amane, so—
        <p></p>without thinking—he grabbed her shoulder and stopped her.
        <p></p>Mahiru's expression stiffened immediately, and Amane
        <p></p>knew that he had messed up. He pulled back the hand that
        <p></p>he'd put up to stop her and waved it in front of his face.
        <p></p>"Th-that's not— It's not that I don't want to… Just, it's
        <p></p>like, I feel awkward again, about getting close to you. When
        <p></p>you go for it so suddenly, somehow it's kind ofembarrassing, don't you think?"
        <p></p>He tacked on the lame question at the end because he was
        <p></p>uncomfortable.
        <p></p>They had been close enough to touch plenty of times
        <p></p>before, to the point where it had become normal, but now
        <p></p>that their relationship had changed, sitting at the usual
        <p></p>distance somehow made Amane nervous.
        <p></p>It wasn't that he hadn't felt embarrassed before, but now
        <p></p>that his perception of Mahiru had changed, he was overly
        <p></p>conscious of her.
        <p></p>"…When I think about you being my girlfriend, I can't
        <p></p>settle down. It's my first time dating anyone, and…"
        <p></p>"I mean, it's not like I'm perfectly composed, either, but…I
        <p></p>guess my feeling of wanting to stay close is stronger. N-now
        <p></p>that we've finally started dating…I think it's best if we are
        <p></p>honest about our feelings."
        <p></p>Mahiru's voice trembled with slight bashfulness as she
        <p></p>mumbled those words, looking up at Amane timidly. The
        <p></p>effect was so charming that Amane stifled his groan.
        <p></p>"So could I get a little…closer?" she asked.
        <p></p>"…Feel free."
        <p></p>If he was being honest, Amane wanted nothing more than
        <p></p>to grab Mahiru and squeeze her tightly like a stuffed animal,
        <p></p>to revel in the joy that was welling up inside of him. But he
        <p></p>had a feeling that if he allowed himself to do that, he might
        <p></p>end up doing something really embarrassing and regret it
        <p></p>afterward, so he decided to limit himself to light cuddling.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to be happy with it, as she leaned against
        <p></p>Amane's arm with a cherubic look of joy on her smiling face.
        <p></p>As a matter of fact, even before they had started dating,
        <p></p>Mahiru had recently become quite clingy. The fact that he
        <p></p>felt more nervous about it than he had before was probably
        <p></p>because he lacked both courage and experience in these
        <p></p>situations.
        <p></p>…I wonder what I should do now?
        <p></p>He worried over whether just cuddling was enough.
        <p></p>Amane had zero dating experience, and Mahiru was his
        <p></p>first girlfriend.
        <p></p>Mahiru was in the same situation, but still, Amane
        <p></p>couldn't help but want to take the lead, as a guy.
        <p></p>But as much as he wanted to take the initiative, he had no
        <p></p>idea how.
        <p></p>Partly because of what had happened to him in the past,
        <p></p>Amane had never shown a lot of interest in others, and since
        <p></p>he'd never been much of a romantic, he'd never even
        <p></p>dreamed about dating a girl. Sadly, Amane's energy had
        <p></p>always been directed toward his studies and hobbies, and he
        <p></p>completely lacked any knowledge when it came to the
        <p></p>essential subject of romance.
        <p></p>Amane's meager understanding was limited to the fact
        <p></p>that boys and girls who were dating held hands, went on
        <p></p>dates, and kissed—and might get more physical once their
        <p></p>relationship became more serious.
        <p></p>Aside from holding hands and going on dates, he couldn't even imagine suddenly kissing her—or doing anything else,
        <p></p>for that matter. So Amane settled on the idea that they
        <p></p>should go out, but he knew that that alone wasn't really
        <p></p>"dating."
        <p></p>Amane wanted to make Mahiru happy, and for the two of
        <p></p>them to be happy together, but he felt slightly hopeless at
        <p></p>the realization that he had absolutely no idea how to go
        <p></p>about it.
        <p></p>"…What's the matter?" Mahiru asked. "D-do you not like
        <p></p>me leaning on you after all…?"
        <p></p>"Ah, no, that's not it. Sorry for making you worry."
        <p></p>Mahiru was staring at Amane, who had been silently
        <p></p>fretting with a serious look on his face. He felt pathetic for
        <p></p>giving her the wrong idea that he didn't like feeling her
        <p></p>touch.
        <p></p>"I was just wondering about something… Well, I think I
        <p></p>can probably ask you, since it involves you, too…"
        <p></p>"S-sure."
        <p></p>Amane felt bad about asking her, since this was her first
        <p></p>time dating anyone as well, but he decided it might be good
        <p></p>to consult with her, as fellow first timers. Surely it was better
        <p></p>to talk things through together, rather than worrying alone.
        <p></p>"So listen, we, um… We've started dating, but…"
        <p></p>"Yes?"
        <p></p>"…Now that we are, what, specifically, should we do?""Huh?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had obviously been bracing herself, unsure of
        <p></p>what kind of question was headed her way. She looked
        <p></p>surprised.
        <p></p>Even though Amane was self-conscious about asking such
        <p></p>a stupid question, even for him, he was asking earnestly.
        <p></p>"…W-well, it's my first time dating anyone, and…I don't
        <p></p>know exactly what we're supposed to do."
        <p></p>"…N-now that you mention it…," she replied.
        <p></p>But as he had expected, Mahiru, who had also never had
        <p></p>much experience with the opposite sex, was similarly
        <p></p>stumped by Amane's conundrum.
        <p></p>"Does anything come to mind?"
        <p></p>"…Holding hands?"
        <p></p>"We do that all the time."
        <p></p>"Spending days off together?"
        <p></p>"That's every day."
        <p></p>"Going out?"
        <p></p>"Well, we've been doing that."
        <p></p>"Hugging?"
        <p></p>"We do that."
        <p></p>Unfortunately, it seemed that Mahiru didn't know any more than Amane, and everything she brought up was
        <p></p>something they'd already done. She couldn't come up with
        <p></p>anything more that couples were supposed to do together. It
        <p></p>seemed like there was nothing else.
        <p></p>What do couples do…?
        <p></p>Amane sighed, and Mahiru tugged nervously at the hem
        <p></p>of his shirt. When he looked at her again, wondering what
        <p></p>was wrong, he saw that her face was flushed slightly red.
        <p></p>"…So it's hard to say this, or rather, it's embarrassing,
        <p></p>but… Haven't we been doing all the things that couples do
        <p></p>together, just without calling it dating…?"
        <p></p>After Mahiru said that, a silence fell over the room.
        <p></p>…Now that she's said it out loud… No, even if she hadn't
        <p></p>said anything, she's right…!
        <p></p>They had been spending time in the same space, holding
        <p></p>hands, and going out together as if it was totally natural, but
        <p></p>those were things that boys and girls normally did when they
        <p></p>were in a relationship.
        <p></p>Of course, even though it might have been clear at first,
        <p></p>maybe he hadn't realized that these activities had become
        <p></p>entirely commonplace for them.
        <p></p>"I—I also wanted you to notice me, and I did my very best
        <p></p>to make it happen, but…when I really think about it, Amane,
        <p></p>I was doing things that a girlfriend does, wasn't I?"
        <p></p>"…N-now that you mention it…"
        <p></p>"So maybe, rather than trying to act like a couple, we should just act like normal…touching each other, and
        <p></p>spending time together, and stuff. Besides, isn't it better if,
        <p></p>instead of forcing ourselves to conform and overthink
        <p></p>everything, we just do it our own way…I mean, date the way
        <p></p>we want to…?"
        <p></p>Amane felt a weight had lifted at the words our own way.
        <p></p>…Maybe we don't have to worry about how other people
        <p></p>do things?
        <p></p>Amane had been anxious to act the part of a boyfriend,
        <p></p>but there was really no need to worry about that. Mahiru
        <p></p>liked Amane, and Amane liked Mahiru, so they were
        <p></p>together. As long as those things were true, everything was
        <p></p>fine. They could take their time and didn't have to rush or
        <p></p>push themselves.
        <p></p>"You're right. I'm sorry, I just… You know I always
        <p></p>overthink things. This is my first time, so I really don't know
        <p></p>what I'm doing."
        <p></p>"…Right."
        <p></p>"So what, then? …We'll act like we always have, but…from
        <p></p>now on, like, with love?"
        <p></p>With his mind made up, Amane took Mahiru's hand in
        <p></p>his. Her cheeks, which were already quite red, flushed even
        <p></p>more. She cast her eyes down as if she was embarrassed but
        <p></p>squeezed his hand back and leaned against his arm.
        <p></p>"Amane?"
        <p></p>"Yeah?" "…I'm happy, just like this."
        <p></p>"Me too."
        <p></p>Amane agreed with her quietly whispered words, and he
        <p></p>silently enjoyed the feeling of warmth against his side.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 55: Going to School Together and Making a Debut 
        <p></p>"Amane, wake up please."
        <p></p>There was a gentle voice calling his name.
        <p></p>In the midst of a comfortable slumber, he answered the
        <p></p>soft whispering voice with a short "Mm," raised his heavy
        <p></p>eyelids, and slowly opened his eyes.
        <p></p>The blurry figure of a lovely girl appeared before him,
        <p></p>faintly illuminated by the sunlight streaming in through the
        <p></p>window.
        <p></p>She seemed to have put one knee up on the bed to shake
        <p></p>him awake and was leaning forward, her hemp-colored hair
        <p></p>cascading around her like wisteria vines that swayed with
        <p></p>her every movement.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Yes. Good morning."
        <p></p>When he called out her name to confirm it was her, she
        <p></p>nodded and answered in a familiar voice.
        <p></p>Amane didn't think he'd overslept, so he was having a
        <p></p>little trouble figuring out why Mahiru was in his bedroom.
        <p></p>She was there as if it was the most natural thing in the
        <p></p>world, further deepening his confusion. "…Morning. Why are you here?"
        <p></p>"Don't you remember what we talked about yesterday?"
        <p></p>Mahiru frowned slightly.
        <p></p>"Yesterday?" he replied, then recalled their exchange from
        <p></p>the previous evening.
        <p></p>"Beginning this Monday, could we start walking to school
        <p></p>together?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had brought up the question as they were parting
        <p></p>on Sunday night.
        <p></p>She'd looked up at him uneasily, fidgeting as if she
        <p></p>couldn't settle down, which made him a little nervous, too.
        <p></p>Mahiru had probably spoken cautiously in order to see
        <p></p>whether Amane was planning to conceal their relationship.
        <p></p>They had already talked it over and decided to go public, but
        <p></p>she still seemed worried about it.
        <p></p>As far as Amane was concerned, they had basically
        <p></p>confessed their love to the world already, so he hadn't even
        <p></p>considered keeping it a secret. Rather, he fully intended to
        <p></p>tell people they were dating now.
        <p></p>"Yeah, sure."
        <p></p>"R-really?"
        <p></p>"What would I get out of lying?"
        <p></p>When she had heard Amane's answer, the tinge of anxiety
        <p></p>in Mahiru's eyes disappeared, replaced by shades of delight. Amane's heart fluttered when he'd heard her whisper
        <p></p>bashfully, "I've always wanted to walk to school together,"
        <p></p>but she hadn't seemed to notice his agitation.
        <p></p>"All right, then, I'll come over to your place in the
        <p></p>morning," she'd said brightly. "While we're at it, we may as
        <p></p>well eat breakfast together."
        <p></p>"Oh, sweet. I get to eat Mahiru's cooking first thing in the
        <p></p>morning."
        <p></p>"It's just going to be leftovers… Is it all right if I make you
        <p></p>a lunch box, too?"
        <p></p>"I would like nothing better."
        <p></p>Amane would have been perfectly content with the
        <p></p>breakfasts that Mahiru made, so he couldn't help but feel
        <p></p>delighted for a chance to eat her cooking at lunch, too.
        <p></p>The thought that she wouldn't have to restrain herself in
        <p></p>front of other people anymore had Mahiru beaming with
        <p></p>happiness, and Amane was glad to see that whenever she'd
        <p></p>looked at him. At the same time, it made him feel a bit
        <p></p>embarrassed.
        <p></p>We'll start going together tomorrow, huh?
        <p></p>Up to that point, he had been staggering his commutes in
        <p></p>order to avoid giving anyone clues about his relationship
        <p></p>with Mahiru.
        <p></p>But going forward, that would no longer be necessary.
        <p></p>Being open about their relationship at school was sure to
        <p></p>make others jealous of him, which was worrying, but the most important thing was that it would make Mahiru happy.
        <p></p>Being by her side was enough for him.
        <p></p>Amane gazed at Mahiru, who was smiling happily, and
        <p></p>mumbled quietly, "I guess I've got my work cut out for me."
        <p></p>"…Ah—"
        <p></p>As his brain fog started to clear, Amane groaned a little
        <p></p>when he remembered their conversation from the previous
        <p></p>night.
        <p></p>He wasn't opposed to the idea, but seeing Mahiru first
        <p></p>thing in the morning surprised him and made him forget.
        <p></p>Mahiru watched Amane's reaction with an exasperated
        <p></p>look.
        <p></p>But she didn't seem that irritated, rather she looked
        <p></p>amused to be chiding Amane for his hopelessness, so Amane
        <p></p>pouted his lips in apology.
        <p></p>"Good grief, you're so forgetful… Well, go on—get dressed
        <p></p>and wash your face."
        <p></p>"Okay."
        <p></p>Mahiru was probably going to prepare their meals while
        <p></p>he did that.
        <p></p>Suppressing a yawn, Amane got up out of bed and took off
        <p></p>the shirt he was wearing. He heard a sudden shriek from
        <p></p>right beside him. "Hyah!"
        <p></p>He tossed his shirt on the bed, then looked at Mahiru,
        <p></p>who had her eyes firmly closed and was trembling. Her cheeks were red.
        <p></p>"L-listen, I told you this before, but please don't change in
        <p></p>front of me," she said, clearly agitated from seeing him take
        <p></p>off his shirt.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help but smile wryly.
        <p></p>"I'm a guy, so I don't really mind if you see me."
        <p></p>"Well, I do…"
        <p></p>"Look, I'm not trying to show off or anything, and I'm not
        <p></p>going to tell you that you have to get used to it or whatever,
        <p></p>but we won't be able to go to a lot of summer staples like the
        <p></p>pool if you let this bother you."
        <p></p>Amane wondered how Mahiru had gotten by up until
        <p></p>now, since she was apparently not accustomed to seeing
        <p></p>boys' bodies… But since she didn't know how to swim, she
        <p></p>had probably always come up with some reason or another
        <p></p>to sit out of swim classes at school.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't imagine Mahiru, who was so serious by
        <p></p>nature, skipping a class, but since she really didn't know
        <p></p>how to swim, and had purposely chosen a high school where
        <p></p>swimming wasn't a required subject, she must have
        <p></p>managed somehow.
        <p></p>They had talked about possibly visiting the pool over the
        <p></p>summer, which would be difficult if she was overly
        <p></p>conscious. Actually, at the pool, all the boys would be half
        <p></p>naked. Amane was starting to worry if she would be able to
        <p></p>take it.
        <p></p>"Uh… I—I can handle it…," Mahiru responded, almost groaning, in a feeble voice. She must have also been selfconscious about her reaction. Then she timidly opened her
        <p></p>eyes and looked at Amane's body.
        <p></p>Almost on the verge of tears and shaking, with a brightred face, Mahiru groaned after peering at his upper half.
        <p></p>Frankly, Amane didn't think he made for a particularly
        <p></p>salacious tableau. He'd been exercising more and adding to
        <p></p>his training regimen in an effort to become a better match
        <p></p>for Mahiru. Compared to when they'd first met, his figure
        <p></p>was much more robust. Faint bulges of muscle were just
        <p></p>starting to show on his body. But it wasn't something so
        <p></p>impressive as to force Mahiru to avert her eyes.
        <p></p>…If she can't get used to this, it's going to mean trouble
        <p></p>when we go all the way.
        <p></p>Amane figured that was probably a long way off, but it
        <p></p>would still pose some difficulty if their relationship was
        <p></p>going to develop past a certain point.
        <p></p>But Amane was positive that he would also freeze in his
        <p></p>tracks if he ever saw Mahiru similarly exposed, so it was
        <p></p>probably going to be an issue for both of them.
        <p></p>Amane's own face was now red, as he imagined
        <p></p>impossible scenarios, so he spoke to Mahiru, whose face was
        <p></p>just as flushed. "…Uh, so, um… Would you please go make
        <p></p>food?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, I think I'll do that," she replied, scampering out of
        <p></p>the room as fast as she could.
        <p></p>After Mahiru was gone, Amane banged his head on the
        <p></p>nearest wall and let out a small groan. "What was she thinking, so early in the morning?"
        <p></p>Amane stared into the mirror. The person staring back
        <p></p>seemed unfamiliar somehow.
        <p></p>Even though he was dressed in his school uniform as
        <p></p>usual, Amane looked like a different person from the neck
        <p></p>up. Or rather, he looked like a version of himself that he only
        <p></p>ever showed Mahiru—a version that seemed out of place in
        <p></p>his uniform.
        <p></p>Sweeping back his black bangs, Amane teased and
        <p></p>adjusted his hair with his fingertips. He knew he had it easy
        <p></p>compared to girls his age, since he didn't have to apply
        <p></p>makeup or anything, but even so, he wasn't used to carefully
        <p></p>arranging his hair like this.
        <p></p>"…Amane?"
        <p></p>A voice called out to him from behind.
        <p></p>Reflected in the mirror was Mahiru, who had finished
        <p></p>getting ready to leave for school and had come to summon
        <p></p>Amane from the sink.
        <p></p>When he turned around and looked straight at her, he saw
        <p></p>that she had a slightly clouded expression.
        <p></p>"What's the matter?" he asked.
        <p></p>"…Don't you hate that?"
        <p></p>"Hate what?"
        <p></p>"…That hairstyle?" "Oh, that."
        <p></p>She broached the topic with some hesitation, and her
        <p></p>words made Amane worry.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed anxious about Amane admitting to being
        <p></p>her "mystery man." He'd always rejected the idea of styling
        <p></p>his hair this way before going to school.
        <p></p>As far as Amane was concerned, however, he'd taken the
        <p></p>time to dress himself up because he'd wanted to. It would
        <p></p>have been a lie to say he didn't feel at least a little nervous,
        <p></p>but since he had resolved to stand confidently by Mahiru's
        <p></p>side, he wanted to go with a look that wouldn't make her
        <p></p>embarrassed to be seen with him.
        <p></p>He wasn't necessarily going to stand out as some hunk,
        <p></p>but this look had gotten the seal of approval from Itsuki and
        <p></p>Yuuta. For now, Amane was just hoping nobody would
        <p></p>question Mahiru's tastes in men.
        <p></p>"Not really; I don't hate it. Do you?" he asked.
        <p></p>"…I don't hate it, but…I'm just feeling a bit conflicted."
        <p></p>"Conflicted?"
        <p></p>"…I might have a hard time keeping you all to myself."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked undeniably sweet as she bashfully
        <p></p>mumbled those charming words. Amane gave a little smile
        <p></p>and gently stroked her head, being careful not to muss her
        <p></p>hair.
        <p></p>"Well, why not enjoy having me to yourself while you still
        <p></p>can?" "…I think I will."
        <p></p>Honestly, he had meant it as a joke, but Mahiru nodded
        <p></p>obediently and pressed herself against Amane's chest.
        <p></p>He had never expected her to agree, and he cringed a little
        <p></p>when he realized he had said something that sounded
        <p></p>presumptuous, but his lips curled naturally into a smile as
        <p></p>he felt her forehead against his body.
        <p></p>There was nothing strange about his hand moving on its
        <p></p>own to stroke her hair, in response to her overwhelming
        <p></p>cuteness.
        <p></p>Mahiru was about one head shorter than him and had her
        <p></p>face buried in his chest, clutching the fabric of his shirt so he
        <p></p>couldn't pull away.
        <p></p>But when she glanced up at him, she looked somehow
        <p></p>lonely.
        <p></p>"…You're really cool, so I feel like lots of other girls are
        <p></p>going to talk to you. I'm happy they'll see you for what you
        <p></p>really are, but…"
        <p></p>"Leaving aside whether I'm actually cool or not, do you
        <p></p>think I have eyes for anyone other than you?"
        <p></p>"No, I don't, but it's an emotional issue."
        <p></p>"Jealousy?"
        <p></p>When Amane asked this without thinking, Mahiru's
        <p></p>cheeks instantly flushed, but she affirmed his guess with a
        <p></p>meek yes before rubbing her forehead into his chest again. She must have been really embarrassed. Even her ears,
        <p></p>peeking out from her flaxen hair, were a deep red.
        <p></p>"It's all right. Even if another girl does talk to me, I'm not
        <p></p>interested in anyone but you, Mahiru."
        <p></p>He knew that probably wasn't enough to quell her anxiety,
        <p></p>but Amane really didn't think about other girls in a romantic
        <p></p>way. His attention would not be diverted so long as he had
        <p></p>this beloved girlfriend who was burning with adorable
        <p></p>jealousy.
        <p></p>Amane was naturally apathetic toward unfamiliar people
        <p></p>anyway, so he was confident he wouldn't even take notice of
        <p></p>any other girls. And the type of girl who would suddenly
        <p></p>show interest in him because of his new appearance was the
        <p></p>kind he didn't want to get to know in the first place.
        <p></p>"…I know that. That's why I'm reminding you of my
        <p></p>feelings, so there's no opening for someone to take
        <p></p>advantage of."
        <p></p>"Just don't get carried away… I don't want to let other
        <p></p>people see too many of your cute faces."
        <p></p>"…You're so quick to say things like that!"
        <p></p>Flustered by Mahiru's sudden burst of inexplicable anger,
        <p></p>Amane tried to soothe her by stroking her hair, but she beat
        <p></p>playfully at his chest.
        <p></p>"When you say things like that so casually, I just can't take
        <p></p>it," she exclaimed.
        <p></p>"What does that mean?" "It's bad for my heart."
        <p></p>"Hey, that's my line… And anyway, you're one to talk.
        <p></p>Sometimes I feel like I might die, because you fawn all over
        <p></p>me so naturally."
        <p></p>It was actually Mahiru who, along with her propensity for
        <p></p>touching him, had the highest destructive power.
        <p></p>The feeling of her soft body, the way her scent hung in the
        <p></p>air, and how she always gently smiled at him meant that
        <p></p>Amane's heart was always beating fast, like he was
        <p></p>constantly sprinting.
        <p></p>He could feel his heart thumping loudly from Mahiru's
        <p></p>loveliness. She must have noticed it, too, with her face
        <p></p>buried in his chest.
        <p></p>"…I always suspected that a surprise attack would be
        <p></p>more effective," Mahiru mumbled quietly as she pressed her
        <p></p>cheek tightly against his chest. "…But your heart is really
        <p></p>pounding hard, so as of today, I'm convinced of it," she
        <p></p>whispered, seeming very satisfied to know she had made his
        <p></p>heart race, and brushed her cheek against him.
        <p></p>The action was so sweet that Amane nearly groaned again.
        <p></p>He told himself to get a grip and stroked Mahiru's hair as a
        <p></p>way of redirecting the urges that arose inside of him.
        <p></p>After about five minutes, Mahiru seemed to be energized.
        <p></p>Seeing her flushed cheeks and watery eyes made Amane's
        <p></p>heart ache, but Mahiru appeared content, so he sequestered
        <p></p>his impatient feelings down deep in his chest.
        <p></p>"Well, should we get going?" Despite the morning distractions, they would be on time
        <p></p>for school, as they had given themselves plenty of time to
        <p></p>prepare. Even so, Amane wanted to leave soon, and when he
        <p></p>said so, Mahiru put on a smile and answered, "Yes." Her
        <p></p>skin was glowing.
        <p></p>It's only morning, and I'm already exhausted…
        <p></p>Amane didn't dislike the show of affection—actually, it
        <p></p>was just the opposite; he was so pleased by it that he was
        <p></p>wearing himself out by exercising all his self-restraint. If it
        <p></p>had been the weekend, he would have indulged Mahiru
        <p></p>further, but they had school, so he was unable to do as he
        <p></p>wished.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't appear to have noticed Amane's
        <p></p>exhaustion. She seemed to be bursting with energy.
        <p></p>Even though he was a little tired from the morning's
        <p></p>various tribulations, it wasn't a bad sort of tiredness. Amane
        <p></p>smiled wryly, picked up his school bag, and he and Mahiru
        <p></p>stepped out the door together.
        <p></p>Feeling some strangely deep emotions about leaving the
        <p></p>house in school uniforms together for the first time, Amane
        <p></p>locked the door and looked over at Mahiru. She was
        <p></p>fidgeting nervously.
        <p></p>Her hand was still gripping the hem of his shirt.
        <p></p>"…Want to hold hands?"
        <p></p>"Yeah."
        <p></p>He had apparently guessed correctly. Looking at the
        <p></p>bashful Mahiru, he grumbled quietly, "You're so cute, damn," then casually took her backpack and slung it over his
        <p></p>own shoulder. With the opposite hand, he intertwined his
        <p></p>own fingers with Mahiru's.
        <p></p>She immediately looked up at him with eyes that said she
        <p></p>hadn't meant to make him carry her bag, but he whispered,
        <p></p>"I'm your boyfriend now, so you should let me do things like
        <p></p>this for you."
        <p></p>Mahiru pressed her lips tightly together in an adorable
        <p></p>expression of acceptance.
        <p></p>"You know, it feels kind of embarrassing to hold hands
        <p></p>like this again," Amane said.
        <p></p>They were leaving the apartment building and walking
        <p></p>their normal route to school, but they hadn't held hands like
        <p></p>this since their Golden Week outing, so there was a slight
        <p></p>awkwardness to it.
        <p></p>Rather than simply being her escort, Amane entwined his
        <p></p>fingers with Mahiru's, holding her hand in a gesture of
        <p></p>loving intimacy. They had held hands many times before,
        <p></p>but never like this, so he was naturally quite nervous.
        <p></p>He was worried about whether he was squeezing her hand
        <p></p>too tightly, or if his sweaty palms were making her
        <p></p>uncomfortable, but when he glanced over at Mahiru, she was
        <p></p>smiling cheerfully.
        <p></p>"It feels a little embarrassing, but I'm happy," she said.
        <p></p>"…Yeah."
        <p></p>"I've been wanting to go to school like this for a long time.
        <p></p>And finally being able to do that… I'm just…so happy." Walking to school side by side was such a trivial thing. But
        <p></p>apparently it was something Mahiru had been eagerly
        <p></p>anticipating, and her expression looked brighter than usual.
        <p></p>"And does that have much to do with me?"
        <p></p>Mahiru relaxed into a smile and mumbled timidly, "S-sure
        <p></p>it does… Because being with you is the reason why I'm
        <p></p>happy."
        <p></p>"…I see."
        <p></p>Amane felt his chest growing gradually hot as he realized
        <p></p>just how much she liked him.
        <p></p>He had been trying his best not to let his timidness show
        <p></p>on his face, but Mahiru seemed to notice, and her happy
        <p></p>smile broadened.
        <p></p>"So from now on, I'm going to be happy every day… I'm a
        <p></p>lucky girl."
        <p></p>"I feel like I should be the one saying that sort of thing."
        <p></p>"Well then, we're both happy, and that's cause for
        <p></p>celebration, don't you agree? We can finally enjoy it."
        <p></p>Mahiru giggled and leaned in close.
        <p></p>Taking care not to disturb Mahiru, Amane subtly shifted
        <p></p>so that there was still some room between them. With his
        <p></p>free hand, he gave her a pat on the head.
        <p></p>Although he had gotten used to walking while holding
        <p></p>hands, Amane was still uncomfortable getting too close in
        <p></p>public. Of course, he was glad to be near his girlfriend, but
        <p></p>he was worried about how it must look to other people if the two of them were too affectionate so early in the morning.
        <p></p>Trying not to let his uncertainty show on his face, Amane
        <p></p>squeezed Mahiru's dainty hand tightly, and they walked to
        <p></p>school with their arms pressed against each other.
        <p></p>It was the time of day where people would be commuting
        <p></p>to work or school, so there were a lot of students and people
        <p></p>in suits around. Amane was bothered by the thought that
        <p></p>they were all looking at them.
        <p></p>The closer they got to school, the more he felt like people
        <p></p>were staring.
        <p></p>"I can feel their eyes on us," Amane grumbled exhaustedly
        <p></p>in spite of himself.
        <p></p>They received a lot of different looks. Some people must
        <p></p>have been wondering who the boy walking hand in hand
        <p></p>with Mahiru was. Others were looking at the couple with
        <p></p>jealousy or envy in their eyes.
        <p></p>And while Amane had expected as much, actually
        <p></p>experiencing it was more uncomfortable than he had
        <p></p>imagined. At least not everybody who looked their way
        <p></p>seemed to disapprove, but as someone who had been
        <p></p>perfectly happy living a quiet, inconspicuous life, he was
        <p></p>certainly feeling unsettled.
        <p></p>"There's no helping it," Mahiru said. "At a glance, you
        <p></p>look like a changed man."
        <p></p>He and Mahiru, pressed close, were walking alongside
        <p></p>each other holding hands. Of course, calling attention to the
        <p></p>fact that they really were a couple was going to earn them
        <p></p>some stares from the other students on their way to school.But it was obvious that something had changed with Amane
        <p></p>since Sports Day, and although no one was asking who he
        <p></p>was out loud, they were watching with curious eyes.
        <p></p>"Do I really look that different?"
        <p></p>"Yes. How can I put it? You changed your hair, obviously,
        <p></p>but you're also standing up nice and straight, and you have a
        <p></p>confident expression, so the impression you make is
        <p></p>completely different."
        <p></p>"Sorry, I've always been a loser."
        <p></p>"Please don't put yourself down… You've always been
        <p></p>different. I like both versions of you, but I hate the Amane
        <p></p>who belittles himself."
        <p></p>"I'll be careful from now on; I don't like hearing that you
        <p></p>hate me."
        <p></p>"Very good."
        <p></p>Mahiru gave Amane a satisfied smile, and even more
        <p></p>stares came their way.
        <p></p>This time, some of them gave more menacing looks,
        <p></p>which made Amane's cheek twitch slightly, but they
        <p></p>disappeared as soon as Mahiru flashed a first-rate angelic
        <p></p>smile at the onlookers.
        <p></p>In some senses, the angel, unfazed by the attention of the
        <p></p>crowds, was the stronger of the two of them.
        <p></p>Amane adjusted his grip on Mahiru's hand and looked
        <p></p>straight ahead. He could still feel the prickle of staring eyes.
        <p></p>They would arrive at school very soon, which meant even more people would be looking. Amane's shoulders began to
        <p></p>ache a little.
        <p></p>"If this is how people are staring now, it's gonna be really
        <p></p>annoying once we're in the classroom."
        <p></p>"Better come to terms with it… Or are you saying you hate
        <p></p>it?"
        <p></p>"I don't hate it. After all, I decided to change."
        <p></p>When Mahiru had confessed her feelings, Amane had
        <p></p>known he was going to have to change his life for the better.
        <p></p>He'd already made up his mind to improve himself so he
        <p></p>could be the kind of guy who was good enough to be
        <p></p>Mahiru's boyfriend—and a version of himself that he
        <p></p>wouldn't be ashamed of.
        <p></p>Amane readied himself, feeling a slight stomachache
        <p></p>coming on. He couldn't let himself slack off; he had to
        <p></p>become someone worthy of her.
        <p></p>"…Is that so?" Mahiru murmured, squeezing his fingers
        <p></p>tightly.
        <p></p>"Huh? Mahiru?"
        <p></p>Amane noticed Mahiru's ears had gone slightly red, and
        <p></p>he was about to point that out when a familiar, cutesy voice
        <p></p>called out from behind. They turned around and saw
        <p></p>Chitose, blinking dramatically in surprise.
        <p></p>Wearing an expression that could best be described as
        <p></p>dazed, Chitose looked Mahiru over, then shifted her gaze to
        <p></p>examine Amane. Chitose noticed their interlocked hands and smiled in
        <p></p>satisfaction, "Aha!" She trotted up to them and slapped
        <p></p>Amane on the back enthusiastically. "Good morning! So you
        <p></p>finally decided to make an appearance, mystery man?"
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>"Morning, Mahiru! I see everything went well!"
        <p></p>Chitose looked like she was in a great mood as she
        <p></p>slapped him again, fairly hard, with a wide smile.
        <p></p>So far they had only gotten looks of curiosity and jealousy,
        <p></p>so Amane's chest warmed just a little at this expression of
        <p></p>pure goodwill.
        <p></p>"Congratulations, Mahiru! I guess there was some use in
        <p></p>me always looking out for you!"
        <p></p>"I used your advice for all sorts of things."
        <p></p>"Sure did! Like what to do when Amane was being so
        <p></p>obtuse, and so on."
        <p></p>"…Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"W-well, you were really slow to realize…"
        <p></p>He wasn't able to make much of a counterargument.
        <p></p>It was his own fault for stubbornly failing to pick up on
        <p></p>the signals she had been sending out the whole time, so it
        <p></p>was no wonder she had consulted with Chitose.
        <p></p>"Well, it is Amane we're talking about, after all," Chitose
        <p></p>said as she looked him over again. He wasn't too happy about that appraisal. Chitose examined him closely,
        <p></p>probably because it was the first time she had ever seen him
        <p></p>style his hair properly."Wow, even so, I think this is the first time I've ever seen
        <p></p>Amane all dressed up like Mahiru's mystery man!"
        <p></p>"…What did you call me?"
        <p></p>"That's what Itsuki and Yuuta called it. Mm-hmm, you
        <p></p>know, you're not at Itsuki's level, but you still look pretty
        <p></p>good!"
        <p></p>Chitose smiled again and whacked him on the back. It was
        <p></p>her way of showing that she cared. Amane took this as
        <p></p>encouragement—and reassurance that he was the same as
        <p></p>always even if his outward appearance had changed—and his
        <p></p>lips curled slightly upward.
        <p></p>"So as far as you're concerned, Itsuki's number one,
        <p></p>right?"
        <p></p>"Of course he is! And you're Mahiru's number one, so no
        <p></p>complaints, right?"
        <p></p>"All right, as long as I'm in that position, I'm happy."
        <p></p>Amane had no interest in becoming Chitose's number
        <p></p>one. He was perfectly satisfied so long as Mahiru said he was
        <p></p>the most important person to her.
        <p></p>He glanced over at Mahiru, who was still holding his
        <p></p>hand. She put her face close to his arm and whispered
        <p></p>quietly, "…Amane is my number one." Maybe she was
        <p></p>slightly embarrassed to announce it in front of Chitose—her
        <p></p>cheeks flushed a bit.
        <p></p>"The blushing maiden! You're so cute, Mahiru. If Amane
        <p></p>wasn't here, I'd give you a big hug and shower you with love."
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah. That's not something to do on the way to
        <p></p>school; you can hug her all you want once we get to the
        <p></p>classroom."
        <p></p>"Huh? Yay! Mahiru, I got permission from your
        <p></p>boyfriend! I'm gonna squeeze you tight later!"
        <p></p>"Ah, o-okay, sure, just—be gentle…?"
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded with bewilderment once it was somehow
        <p></p>decided that she was going to get hugged, and Chitose
        <p></p>started walking along beside her, grinning from ear to ear.
        <p></p>She was probably eager to congratulate Mahiru.
        <p></p>Satisfied that the two of them were getting along
        <p></p>harmoniously, Amane turned away and started to look
        <p></p>around.
        <p></p>There were more eyes on them than ever before.
        <p></p>…Bet we're going to be hit with a barrage of questions
        <p></p>when we get to the classroom.
        <p></p>Amane smiled bitterly but made sure the two girls
        <p></p>wouldn't see it, as he imagined what would be coming soon
        <p></p>in several minutes under a deluge of stares.
        <p></p>Once they made it to the school building, they were met
        <p></p>with even more looks, and even though Chitose was by their
        <p></p>side, the sight of Amane and Mahiru holding hands and
        <p></p>walking down the hall naturally attracted a lot of attention.
        <p></p>Chitose reacted nonchalantly, "Whoa, you're really the
        <p></p>center of attention." But Amane wasn't accustomed to all the staring.
        <p></p>Mahiru strolled along confidently, accustomed to drawing
        <p></p>people's gazes. Their tightly clasped hands were in full view
        <p></p>—and the walk to the classroom was something like a public
        <p></p>debut.
        <p></p>As they proceeded down the hallway, Amane could hear
        <p></p>voices.
        <p></p>"The angel is with a guy…"
        <p></p>"Shiina looks different than usual…"
        <p></p>"Was there always a guy like that here?! That's a different
        <p></p>guy from the one at Sports Day, isn't it…?"
        <p></p>Of course, Amane was actually the same boy who Mahiru
        <p></p>had pointed out as her important person on Sports Day.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't respond to any of their comments, but she
        <p></p>did show her sweet, angelic smile to everyone around them.
        <p></p>"Amane?"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"We'll arrive soon. Are you doing all right?"
        <p></p>Mahiru posed the question as they approached their
        <p></p>classroom.
        <p></p>"We're already showing off that we're dating, and I've
        <p></p>prepared myself. I'll be fine."
        <p></p>"…Is that so?" "Everyone's gonna be so surprised!" Chitose interrupted.
        <p></p>"Imagine, Amane showing up all handsome the Monday
        <p></p>after Mahiru made that huge declaration. I was surprised,
        <p></p>too!" Chitose gave an easygoing smile.
        <p></p>Amane realized that he probably should have contacted
        <p></p>her and told her, as well as Itsuki and Yuuta, and felt slightly
        <p></p>regretful.
        <p></p>He had put it off because he'd felt awkward about
        <p></p>announcing that he and Mahiru had started dating, but
        <p></p>looking back, he was sure he ought to have informed the
        <p></p>friends who had been looking out for them first.
        <p></p>"…Chitose?"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"Sorry, um, for not letting you know."
        <p></p>"Nah, you got together after Sports Day was over, right? I
        <p></p>figured the two of you were busy making out, plus you're the
        <p></p>type who would rather tell us face-to-face and not over text
        <p></p>messages, so don't worry about it!"
        <p></p>Amane had mixed feelings about Chitose's certainty that
        <p></p>they had been "busy making out," but it was true that the
        <p></p>two of them had spent the previous day snuggled up
        <p></p>together, thinking of nothing else.
        <p></p>Besides, as Chitose had said, Amane had wanted to
        <p></p>personally share the news with his friends who had looked
        <p></p>out for them in various ways rather than over the phone.
        <p></p>And Chitose had figured it out before he'd said anything and
        <p></p>run up to tease them, so it was less of an announcement and
        <p></p>more like she was just confirming it was real. "…Thank you."
        <p></p>"My pleasure! Heh-heh, you should have a little more
        <p></p>respect for me; it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that I
        <p></p>was a central figure in hooking you two up!"
        <p></p>"Ha-ha. Allow me to repay the great Chitose with a crepe
        <p></p>from that place you like in front of the station sometime."
        <p></p>"I accept your offer!"
        <p></p>As Amane engaged in some banter with Chitose, he and
        <p></p>Mahiru arrived at the door to their classroom.
        <p></p>"Ah, good morning, Shii…na?"
        <p></p>The first to notice them were some girls who were
        <p></p>hanging out nearby.
        <p></p>They were sitting on their desks, talking excitedly about
        <p></p>something, but they looked up when they realized Mahiru
        <p></p>had entered the room…then noticed Amane holding her
        <p></p>hand.
        <p></p>Their eyes traveled from the clasped hands to Amane's
        <p></p>face.
        <p></p>The looks on the girls' faces showed that they were
        <p></p>wondering who he was.
        <p></p>That wasn't surprising, Amane had never dressed up in
        <p></p>front of his classmates before. Some of the girls in class had
        <p></p>probably seen him around town, but the Amane Fujimiya
        <p></p>they knew from school had never looked like that, so in their
        <p></p>eyes, he must have seemed like a stranger. However, the incident at Sports Day the week before,
        <p></p>where Mahiru made it public that Amane was her
        <p></p>"important person," was still fresh in everybody's minds.
        <p></p>And Amane had also admitted to being the guy they'd seen
        <p></p>with Mahiru during Golden Week.
        <p></p>If they put a little thought into it, they should have been
        <p></p>able to make the connection that the young man currently
        <p></p>holding hands with Mahiru was indeed Amane.
        <p></p>Before they had completed the mental calculus needed to
        <p></p>reach that conclusion, Amane let go of Mahiru's hand and
        <p></p>put his bag down on his desk.
        <p></p>He did it to show everyone very clearly who he was.
        <p></p>Once they realized, the classroom became quieter than
        <p></p>usual. Even the classmates who were usually bursting with
        <p></p>conversation had their eyes trained on Amane.
        <p></p>"Good morning, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>Just as the silence was starting to feel awkward, Yuuta
        <p></p>and Itsuki approached Amane, wearing their usual smiles.
        <p></p>He was suddenly extremely grateful for his two friends,
        <p></p>who not only recognized him but greeted him like they
        <p></p>always did.
        <p></p>"Mornin', guys."
        <p></p>"What's going on, Amane? Did you finally accept your
        <p></p>fate?"
        <p></p>"Come on, Yuuta, that's no way to put it… It's more like,
        <p></p>he caught her, but he got caught as well." Amane had consulted with the two of them many times.
        <p></p>And Itsuki had been the first one to recognize that he had
        <p></p>feelings for Mahiru. The two boys had been able to tell what
        <p></p>was going on the instant Amane and Mahiru had walked into
        <p></p>the classroom holding hands, especially with Amane having
        <p></p>styled his hair in what they had named his "mystery man"
        <p></p>look.
        <p></p>"Congratulations, Fujimiya. We've only become friends
        <p></p>recently, so I can't say it's actually been that long, but I was
        <p></p>starting to get impatient. I'm excited that it's finally
        <p></p>happening."
        <p></p>"You don't know the half of it, Yuuta! I've been looking
        <p></p>out for him for like half a year. There's a limit to how much a
        <p></p>guy can take, waitin' on this coward!"
        <p></p>"Oh, well, I'm sooo sorry to make you two wait," Amane
        <p></p>answered sarcastically.
        <p></p>Itsuki nodded seriously and mumbled, "It took you long
        <p></p>enough." It seemed like his friend might have actually gotten
        <p></p>rather emotional after watching Amane and Mahiru dance
        <p></p>around each other for the past six months.
        <p></p>For better or worse, Itsuki had helped Amane and pushed
        <p></p>him along—more accurately, kicked him forward—so Amane
        <p></p>was grateful. Itsuki had been a little too meddlesome
        <p></p>sometimes, but even so, he had always been there to
        <p></p>encourage Amane whenever he was at a standstill. Among
        <p></p>all their friends, Itsuki was probably the one who was most
        <p></p>invested in their new relationship.
        <p></p>"So you made up your mind to go with that look, huh?"
        <p></p>"Yeah." "Man, it seems weird; I'm not used to seeing you done up
        <p></p>like that."
        <p></p>"You're right. I only got to see it the other day."
        <p></p>Yuuta had seen Amane dressed up for Golden Week
        <p></p>almost a month ago. But that had been the only time, so
        <p></p>Amane wasn't surprised that his friends weren't used to it
        <p></p>yet. The only one who was used to it was Mahiru.
        <p></p>Speaking of Mahiru, Chitose was hanging all over her,
        <p></p>rubbing her head teasingly as their other classmates shuffled
        <p></p>over to swarm around them. Amane was some distance
        <p></p>away, but the classroom was so quiet that he could hear
        <p></p>what they were asking her. Even if he hadn't, though, he
        <p></p>could have guessed what they were discussing.
        <p></p>"Hey, Fujimiya!"
        <p></p>As Amane was staring sympathetically in Mahiru's
        <p></p>direction, someone else called his name.
        <p></p>When he turned toward the voice, several girls had
        <p></p>surrounded him. They were looking him over, not even
        <p></p>attempting to hide the immense curiosity in their eyes.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't very good at dealing with the opposite sex,
        <p></p>so situations like this had always been bad for his stomach.
        <p></p>However, he had been steeling himself for something like
        <p></p>this to happen, so he answered without letting his inner
        <p></p>thoughts show.
        <p></p>"…What is it?"
        <p></p>"Wow, it really is Fujimiya! You look a bit different, so we
        <p></p>were surprised!" "Yeah, this is a totally new look!"
        <p></p>"It really is! Before, you were pretty plain!"
        <p></p>"Whoa, it's rude to call him plain."
        <p></p>"Ah, sorry, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>"It's fine; you're not wrong," Amane said with a wry smile.
        <p></p>He was almost overwhelmed by the energy of the girls but
        <p></p>tried his best not to get swept away.
        <p></p>What they were saying was the truth, so he didn't argue
        <p></p>back or get angry about it. He was the one who chose to be
        <p></p>plain, and personality-wise, he had never wanted to stand
        <p></p>out, so in class, he had remained the quiet person who was
        <p></p>always just kind of there.
        <p></p>Anyone in this class would have viewed him as reserved
        <p></p>and unremarkable.
        <p></p>That had suddenly changed, so it was understandable
        <p></p>there was some confusion.
        <p></p>"You really committed to a new style, huh?" one of the
        <p></p>girls asked.
        <p></p>"Guess so," he answered. "Is it weird?"
        <p></p>"Not at all! I think you look much better."
        <p></p>"Actually, you're hot now; I was surprised!"
        <p></p>"Well, if you think so, then it must have been worth the
        <p></p>effort."
        <p></p>All their compliments made Amane feel pretty embarrassed, but it wouldn't do him any good to disagree—
        <p></p>he had learned that being too humble could become a toxic
        <p></p>habit over time, so he gratefully accepted the compliments.
        <p></p>He nodded, trying his best to maintain a gentle
        <p></p>expression, and the girls laughed like they were enjoying
        <p></p>themselves.
        <p></p>"Hey, hey, can I ask you one thing?"
        <p></p>"As long as it's something I can answer, go ahead," he
        <p></p>replied.
        <p></p>Finally, here it comes.
        <p></p>It was a question someone was bound to ask sooner or
        <p></p>later, so he planned to answer now, to make the situation
        <p></p>clear.
        <p></p>The rest of their classmates seemed to be straining their
        <p></p>ears to hear, so if he made the announcement here, it was
        <p></p>sure to circulate throughout the school.
        <p></p>"Are you and Mahiru dating? I heard you came to school
        <p></p>holding hands today…"
        <p></p>"Yes, we started dating last week. Thanks for asking."
        <p></p>When he clearly affirmed their suspicions, a chorus of
        <p></p>shrill shrieks filled the room. He thought he could also hear
        <p></p>the boys behind him making noises of despair and
        <p></p>resentment, but he ignored them.
        <p></p>At any rate, he was sure the boys would have their own
        <p></p>questions later, so Amane decided he would deal with them
        <p></p>then."Wha—? How did you get with Shiina…?"
        <p></p>"We've shared a connection since last year. We just
        <p></p>naturally became close. Right, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>Mahiru approached with a smile. That didn't mean that
        <p></p>the barrage of questions was over, but maybe she had
        <p></p>concluded that it would speed things along if the girls saw
        <p></p>her conversing with Amane.
        <p></p>She moved over next to him and stood close enough that
        <p></p>it was hard to tell if they were touching, then flashed a lovely
        <p></p>smile at the girls who had been interrogating him.
        <p></p>"It's difficult to explain, but all sorts of things happened
        <p></p>between us, and we became a couple. My feelings had been
        <p></p>unrequited for a long time, so I'm very, very happy… So I
        <p></p>was sort of bragging. That's why we came in holding hands."
        <p></p>Just like when they were walking to school, Mahiru placed
        <p></p>her hand on Amane's, and he smiled slightly and squeezed
        <p></p>her hand.
        <p></p>"Actually, I think I was the one who fell for you first,"
        <p></p>Amane said.
        <p></p>"Oh, I'm sure I was first," Mahiru teased. "Well, in either
        <p></p>case, you took forever to confess."
        <p></p>"I do regret that; I feel sorry about it. But I've made my
        <p></p>intentions clear, so please forgive me."
        <p></p>"…I believe I was the one who took the first step, though." "Next time, I'll be sure to do it right."
        <p></p>"Do what, exactly?"
        <p></p>"…I…uh…guess we'll see."
        <p></p>If Mahiru was thinking about what the next step in their
        <p></p>relationship might be, she didn't show it… She just acted like
        <p></p>it was a mystery.
        <p></p>Amane had something in mind, but it wasn't the kind of
        <p></p>thing he was going to say out loud. He didn't even feel like
        <p></p>he was old enough for something so serious just yet, so he
        <p></p>tucked the thought away in a far corner of his mind. Amane
        <p></p>was certain his feelings for Mahiru would never fade or
        <p></p>change, no matter how many years went by. He intended to
        <p></p>be the one to ask her, when the time was right, so he decided
        <p></p>that the whole matter could wait.
        <p></p>Mahiru gave Amane a dissatisfied look when he dodged
        <p></p>her question, but he stroked her hair, and she seemed to be
        <p></p>mollified.
        <p></p>"…You're avoiding the issue again."
        <p></p>"I'll say it someday; be patient."
        <p></p>"Always making me wait."
        <p></p>She sounded disappointed, but her expression was one of
        <p></p>pure delight.
        <p></p>But then she seemed to realize something, and she quickly
        <p></p>covered her face with her hands as she flushed bright red.
        <p></p>Amane wondered what had caused her to do that, but when
        <p></p>he looked around the room, he saw their classmates staring,
        <p></p>speechless.
        <p></p>They were all staring at Amane and Mahiru.
        <p></p>—Oops.
        <p></p>Sure, he had been meaning to show off his relationship
        <p></p>with Mahiru and cement his standing as her boyfriend, but
        <p></p>he hadn't meant for them to have the kind of conversation
        <p></p>they usually had at home in front of everybody.
        <p></p>Out of habit, he patted her head without thinking, and it
        <p></p>was easy to see what their classmates thought of him
        <p></p>touching her like that.
        <p></p>"…Watch out, Amane—you're flirting, and you don't even
        <p></p>realize it."
        <p></p>Even Itsuki was telling him to dial it back—and he was
        <p></p>one half of the original "cringe couple."
        <p></p>Flustered, Amane removed his hand from Mahiru's head
        <p></p>and bit down on his lip in an attempt to keep his cheeks
        <p></p>from heating up.
        <p></p>In the blink of an eye, news that Amane and Mahiru had
        <p></p>started dating spread throughout the school. For better or
        <p></p>worse, thanks to some gossipy classmates and their display
        <p></p>of affection on the way to school, the rumors were
        <p></p>confirmed.
        <p></p>Whenever Amane walked down the hall, he would hear
        <p></p>people whispering, so he felt extremely uncomfortable.
        <p></p>"Well, I'm sure it'll die down in a few days," Makoto said,
        <p></p>gazing at the uproar, one step back from the crowd. "I'm sure it will." Kazuya nodded. "Ultimately, people get
        <p></p>bored of talking about the same thing over and over. And
        <p></p>something else will come along, and everyone will forget all
        <p></p>about it."
        <p></p>"I sure hope you're right," Amane groaned. "It's gonna be
        <p></p>awful if every day is like this."
        <p></p>Even during break times, people were whispering things
        <p></p>at a distance, and it really bothered him.
        <p></p>"Well, I'm sure the questions will stop eventually, but you
        <p></p>might find yourself getting swarmed for another reason soon
        <p></p>enough," Makoto said.
        <p></p>"Another reason?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"I think you might be considered a hot commodity now."
        <p></p>"But I'm already taken."
        <p></p>He was already thinking about his future with Mahiru, so
        <p></p>even if another girl tried to catch his eye, he was sure
        <p></p>nothing would happen. Nobody could compete with Mahiru
        <p></p>for his attention. He couldn't imagine choosing anyone over
        <p></p>her.
        <p></p>What Amane didn't want was for people to think he might
        <p></p>be insincere. The thought really bothered him.
        <p></p>"Well, there are times when love isn't logical."
        <p></p>"Hmm, it's rare to hear you say something like that,
        <p></p>Makoto," Kazuya remarked.
        <p></p>"How rude. You know, I bet it's impossible to ignore your feelings, if you really, really like someone, even if you know
        <p></p>they're already taken. Love is like a reflex, or something. Of
        <p></p>course, sometimes you can't act on that impulsiveness,
        <p></p>though," Makoto continued as he looked over at a group of
        <p></p>girls who were huddled together chatting, then sighed.
        <p></p>"Well, I don't think the two of you have anything to worry
        <p></p>about," he added.
        <p></p>"I agree," said Kazuya. "Flaunting it in front of everybody
        <p></p>the way that you two did will probably discourage anyone
        <p></p>else from trying. But you know, Amane, I never would have
        <p></p>thought you'd act like that in public."
        <p></p>"Please forget about that…!"
        <p></p>Amane was struck with embarrassment thinking about his
        <p></p>exchange with Mahiru that morning. They had been trying
        <p></p>to make it clear that they were together, but Amane had
        <p></p>certainly not meant to pat Mahiru's head or come as close as
        <p></p>he had to letting on that he was already thinking about
        <p></p>marriage.
        <p></p>Mahiru had done her best to deflect the attention, but
        <p></p>Itsuki and Makoto had apparently noticed anyway. They'd
        <p></p>made some astonished remarks about how in love the couple
        <p></p>must be.
        <p></p>"Well, Amane, now everyone knows you're the only one
        <p></p>who gets to see that side of Shiina. That counts as a win, at
        <p></p>least?"
        <p></p>"…You're probably right, but even so, it's still pretty
        <p></p>embarrassing."
        <p></p>"Says the guy who came to school holding her hand." "That's different," Amane insisted. That kind of thing was
        <p></p>a lot more mortifying when it was unintentional.
        <p></p>"Aw, you shouldn't feel down. Actually, I bet there are
        <p></p>some people who are grateful you made such a scene."
        <p></p>"Grateful?"
        <p></p>"Sure, the rest of the girls will be happy that all the boys
        <p></p>who had their eyes on Shiina will finally start looking
        <p></p>elsewhere."
        <p></p>The thought had actually crossed Amane's mind already.
        <p></p>Not every girl in their class looked up to Mahiru. Amane
        <p></p>knew some of them had complicated feelings toward her, at
        <p></p>least in part because she monopolized the attention of the
        <p></p>boys in their class. Mahiru had always been single,
        <p></p>unattainable, and had shown no one any affection, but now
        <p></p>that she told everyone she had a special relationship with
        <p></p>Amane and made it clear that she didn't have eyes for
        <p></p>anyone else, some of the animosity the girls held toward her
        <p></p>seemed to have subsided.
        <p></p>"It must be hard for girls to deal with all that stuff,"
        <p></p>Amane remarked. "Well, now that that's settled, I hope
        <p></p>Mahiru can be just one of the girls. She felt so embarrassed
        <p></p>being called an angel; she honestly hated it."
        <p></p>"She really did hate that, huh?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, no surprise there. Even Yuuta makes a face when
        <p></p>you call him a prince."
        <p></p>In his heart, Amane said a little prayer for Yuuta, who
        <p></p>probably had the same problems as Mahiru. "…What are you guys talking about?" Mahiru was headed
        <p></p>their way. She must have finished her conversation with
        <p></p>Chitose.
        <p></p>Although it seemed like she hadn't heard what the boys
        <p></p>had been discussing, Mahiru saw that Amane was blushing
        <p></p>and realized someone must have reminded him of their
        <p></p>interaction that morning. She gave the three of them, Amane
        <p></p>included, a suspicious look.
        <p></p>"Oh, Shiina? We weren't discussing anything particularly
        <p></p>important. We were talking about how you're just one of the
        <p></p>girls now."
        <p></p>"And how on earth did you arrive at that topic…?" Mahiru
        <p></p>asked.
        <p></p>"Ah, well, um…," Amane stammered, "…we were just
        <p></p>talking about how everyone seems to have finally realized
        <p></p>that you're not some angel; you're just an ordinary girl."
        <p></p>Amane and the other boys explained their conversation to
        <p></p>Mahiru, putting aside what had happened that morning.
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded. "I see. You know, I was always aware that
        <p></p>some people…idolized me. So I'm sure what you said is
        <p></p>probably true," she said, keeping her voice down.
        <p></p>Makoto and Kazuya both made faces that said they
        <p></p>understood perfectly.
        <p></p>They had been friends with Yuuta for a long time, so they
        <p></p>most likely had seen all sorts of things along the way. They
        <p></p>probably had been concerned about Mahiru as well, who had
        <p></p>been going through almost the same sort of problems. "But I'm not really worried about what other people say
        <p></p>about me anymore," Mahiru added.
        <p></p>"Oh, really?"
        <p></p>"Nope… As long as I'm the only girl for Amane, nothing
        <p></p>else matters," she replied quietly.
        <p></p>Only Amane, Makoto, and Kazuya were close enough to
        <p></p>hear her.
        <p></p>But her words had been imbued with a great deal of
        <p></p>destructive power.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't the only one who was enchanted by
        <p></p>Mahiru's wide and bashful smile, with her slightly flushed
        <p></p>cheeks.
        <p></p>Makoto and Kazuya made noises of surprise, and the
        <p></p>other students who had been glancing at them occasionally
        <p></p>also stared at Mahiru with their mouths hanging open.
        <p></p>"Fujimiya, do something about your girlfriend…," his
        <p></p>friends groaned.
        <p></p>Amane knew they were right, but even so, he couldn't do
        <p></p>anything about the collateral damage, and anyway, he was
        <p></p>the one suffering the worst of it, so he was busy desperately
        <p></p>trying to calm down his pounding heart.
        <p></p>"…You're really in deep, huh?" Makoto murmured in
        <p></p>exasperation.
        <p></p>Her cheeks still bright red, Mahiru smiled even wider and
        <p></p>nodded.

        <p></p>Chapter 56: Interrogation Over Lunch 
        <p></p>"Amane, what do you want to do for lunch?"
        <p></p>When morning classes were over, Mahiru approached
        <p></p>Amane's seat carrying a bag with two lunch boxes in it.
        <p></p>He had been planning to eat lunch with the usual group
        <p></p>but now found himself hesitating somewhat, worried it
        <p></p>might cause them trouble.
        <p></p>Incidentally, Makoto and Kazuya had been eating with
        <p></p>them lately, but the two of them had already firmly refused
        <p></p>to join them that day, on the grounds that they didn't want
        <p></p>to put themselves in the line of fire. Sadly, it was undeniable
        <p></p>that Amane and Mahiru had been making things even worse
        <p></p>during the breaks between classes.
        <p></p>"Hmm, well, if Itsuki and the others don't mind, I'd like to
        <p></p>eat together, but—" Amane hesitated.
        <p></p>"Did you think we were actually going to abandon you?"
        <p></p>Itsuki, Chitose, and Yuuta joined Amane and Mahiru.
        <p></p>They already had their wallets out.
        <p></p>Itsuki grinned bitterly. "Don't be a stranger, man. We'll
        <p></p>eat together like we always do."
        <p></p>"Itsuki…"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"After all, you two are liable to get into trouble without a
        <p></p>chaperone, so you could almost say it's my responsibility to
        <p></p>be there."
        <p></p>"…I've got mixed feelings about that," Amane grumbled.
        <p></p>But he understood what Itsuki was getting at as he
        <p></p>remembered how careless he and Mahiru had been earlier in
        <p></p>the day. It obviously wasn't intentional, but he wouldn't
        <p></p>deny that either Mahiru or he could slip up again.
        <p></p>Itsuki's concern wasn't entirely misplaced. "Well, in any
        <p></p>case, we're doing the usual," he said.
        <p></p>"I actually want to see Mahiru be more aggressive, so I
        <p></p>don't mind," Chitose said. "As far as I'm concerned, you two
        <p></p>can go for it."
        <p></p>Yuuta chimed in. "I think it would be…awkward for the
        <p></p>rest of us, if you were to make a big show of your intimacy…
        <p></p>you know?"
        <p></p>"You too, Kadowaki…?"
        <p></p>"It would be embarrassing for those of us who'd have to
        <p></p>watch," Yuuta continued. "At the same time, you two seem
        <p></p>happy, and that's the most important thing," he said with a
        <p></p>smile.
        <p></p>Amane was left speechless by Yuuta's heartfelt
        <p></p>endorsement.
        <p></p>"Though some of us would appreciate it if you showed at
        <p></p>least a little restraint," Yuuta added.
        <p></p>Amane had gotten that sense after seeing Makoto's and
        <p></p>Kazuya's reactions, so he nodded seriously.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…So the cafeteria's okay, yeah? I mean, I don't have a
        <p></p>lunch box, so I'm going there anyway."
        <p></p>"Sounds good," Amane agreed.
        <p></p>"All right, let's get going. I wonder what the special is
        <p></p>today?"
        <p></p>"I think it's fried chicken."
        <p></p>"Oh, sweet! The fried chicken they serve here is so light
        <p></p>and crispy; it's so good."
        <p></p>Itsuki walked off, waving his wallet and grinning broadly.
        <p></p>Amane felt grateful and followed him.
        <p></p>"…Here, Amane, take your lunch box."
        <p></p>Once the five of them had taken their seats in the cafeteria
        <p></p>and gotten their food, Mahiru pulled a lunch box out of her
        <p></p>bag and offered it to Amane.
        <p></p>His was one size larger than Mahiru's, which she pulled
        <p></p>out next, and his held quite a bit more food. It was enough to
        <p></p>satisfy the appetite of a high school boy rather than a girl
        <p></p>who usually didn't eat very much.
        <p></p>"Mm, thanks."
        <p></p>"Aw, Mahiru made you lunch, how nice!"
        <p></p>"I'm not giving you any."
        <p></p>"Stingy!" Chitose puffed out her cheeks in feigned anger.
        <p></p>"Why don't you swap a little with me?" Mahiru offered,
        <p></p>and immediately, the balloon of Chitose's cheeks deflated.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>It was a childish performance, but it matched perfectly
        <p></p>with Chitose's carefree attitude, and Itsuki also smiled as he
        <p></p>looked on.
        <p></p>Amane lifted the lid of his lunch box as he listened to the
        <p></p>girls.
        <p></p>The inside was packed with the remainders of the
        <p></p>previous day's chicken-and-tomato stew, spinach and corn
        <p></p>sauteed in butter and soy sauce, steamed broccoli and mini
        <p></p>tomatoes, wieners cut neatly into the shape of little
        <p></p>octopuses, and Amane's favorite dish, rolled omelets.
        <p></p>Knowing Amane's appetite, Mahiru had been sure to
        <p></p>include plenty of the main dish. He basically ate anything,
        <p></p>and liked vegetables, too, but he had a bigger appetite when
        <p></p>there was meat involved. On top of that, she had added
        <p></p>rolled omelets, his favorite food, so Amane was excited.
        <p></p>"I put a lot of your favorite dish in yours, Amane, is that
        <p></p>all right?"
        <p></p>"That omelet is the only thing that's gonna get me through
        <p></p>the afternoon."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"You're exaggerating."
        <p></p>"No, I mean it."
        <p></p>Amane loved egg dishes and found an omelet even more
        <p></p>satisfying than meat. So an extra-large portion of it was
        <p></p>exactly what he wanted.
        <p></p>"Thanks for the meal," Amane said, showing his
        <p></p>appreciation for Mahiru and the food, and immediately
        <p></p>extending his chopsticks toward the omelet.
        <p></p>When he put it in his mouth, it felt soft, and when he bit
        <p></p>down, the harmony between the rich taste of the dashi and
        <p></p>the slight sweetness of the sugar spread gently through his
        <p></p>mouth, and his lips curled into a smile.
        <p></p>It was so delicious that it would have been a waste to
        <p></p>swallow right away, so he chewed slowly and savored the
        <p></p>taste.
        <p></p>People did say it was important to chew your food well,
        <p></p>and he also really felt like he wanted to enjoy it as long as he
        <p></p>could.
        <p></p>The egg was as delicious as always, and as Amane ate
        <p></p>without attempting to hide the look of rapture on his face,
        <p></p>Yuuta watched him and let out an astonished squawk.
        <p></p>"…You make it look really delicious, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>"It really is."
        <p></p>"I can tell. If you can make Amane look that happy when
        <p></p>he's eating, you must be really blessed, Shiina."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>With a smile, Mahiru had been watching Amane. When
        <p></p>Yuuta turned to her, her cheeks flushed slightly, and she
        <p></p>smiled. "Yes, indeed, I'm very grateful that he always tells
        <p></p>me how tasty my cooking is. It's worth the effort—really it
        <p></p>is."
        <p></p>"I'm glad that you made it for me, and trust me, it's
        <p></p>delicious."
        <p></p>"I've got a good grasp on your tastes now, Amane, and I
        <p></p>want to concentrate on cooking stuff you like."
        <p></p>"You're doing fine as it is, I'd say."
        <p></p>"Since I'm going to the trouble, I want to match your
        <p></p>tastes perfectly."
        <p></p>"I like everything you make. As long as you cook it,
        <p></p>anything is delicious."
        <p></p>Amane hoped to be with Mahiru for a long time, so he
        <p></p>didn't want her to cook just to suit his preferences but also
        <p></p>to make things she enjoyed eating.
        <p></p>Rather than matching every meal to his tastes, he wanted
        <p></p>to compare and adjust dishes until they found something
        <p></p>that was just right for the two of them together—and also try
        <p></p>foods Mahiru liked as well.
        <p></p>As Amane tossed a wiener carved with a smiley face into
        <p></p>his mouth, he nodded seriously; Mahiru made an anxious
        <p></p>face and hunched over.
        <p></p>When he saw that her cheeks had taken on a slight tinge
        <p></p>of red, he looked up at the other people around the table and
        <p></p>saw Itsuki looking astonished.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"You're not even gonna give me a chance to keep you from
        <p></p>flirting, eh?"
        <p></p>"…We're not flirting," Amane replied.
        <p></p>"Says you… Tch."
        <p></p>"Wait, so you're saying that this is only the lead-in?"
        <p></p>Chitose asked. "This doesn't even count as flirting yet?"
        <p></p>"You guys…," Amane groaned.
        <p></p>"Well, I guess compared to your exchange in the
        <p></p>classroom earlier, this isn't as bad," Itsuki said. "I can't
        <p></p>blame you for staking your claim, either. If nothing else, you
        <p></p>definitely let everyone know that there isn't the tiniest gap
        <p></p>where they can butt in between you two."
        <p></p>At those words, Amane shifted his gaze from his friends to
        <p></p>the cafeteria seats surrounding them. He noticed that many
        <p></p>of the boys, both their peers and some upperclassmen, were
        <p></p>looking his way.
        <p></p>They were practically glaring at him with undisguised
        <p></p>contempt, although whenever Mahiru glanced in their
        <p></p>direction, they were quick to avert their eyes.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure whether he should be embarrassed
        <p></p>that everyone had overheard their conversation or grateful
        <p></p>that they had managed to rein it in.
        <p></p>Yuuta frowned. "And here I was certain that they were
        <p></p>doing it on purpose…," he grumbled. "…But seriously, it's
        <p></p>great that you're so close. Just remember that it's easy for
        <p></p>others to peer into your little world, so maybe be a little
        <p></p>more discreet," he cautioned. "Though it does seem to have
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>been effective…" Yuuta sounded slightly exasperated as he
        <p></p>added that last part.
        <p></p>Amane could only grimace in response.
        <p></p>"…Wh-what's with the crowd, guys?"
        <p></p>Upon returning to the classroom after lunch, Amane
        <p></p>found himself swarmed by the other boys in his class.
        <p></p>Mahiru was not in her seat—she'd apparently gone to buy
        <p></p>drinks with Chitose. Itsuki and Yuuta saw that Amane was
        <p></p>being surrounded and told him to resign himself to an
        <p></p>interrogation before promptly turning their attention to
        <p></p>preparing for the next class.
        <p></p>Amane cursed them for being so insensitive, but he knew
        <p></p>that if he was going to continue dating Mahiru, he'd have to
        <p></p>learn to deal with this sort of thing himself. So he let out a
        <p></p>quiet sigh and allowed the boys in his class to encircle him.
        <p></p>Surprisingly, they didn't seem to be mad at Amane in
        <p></p>particular. It was more like they simply needed to vent their
        <p></p>frustrations at him.
        <p></p>"Incredible, the theft of the century! You've stolen our
        <p></p>angel!"
        <p></p>"…You're overstating it, plus Mahiru never belonged to
        <p></p>any of you in the first place."
        <p></p>"I'm so jealous; you get to eat the angel's handmade
        <p></p>lunches!"
        <p></p>"…Well, we are dating, so you can't really complain about
        <p></p>that."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"I can't believe you got someone so out of your league, just
        <p></p>like that."
        <p></p>"…It wasn't exactly easy, you know."
        <p></p>Complaints were flying at him from every direction, but
        <p></p>all of them were just sulky and benign. He could hear some
        <p></p>small tinges of jealousy, but they weren't shouting their
        <p></p>objections to the relationship itself, so Itsuki, who kept
        <p></p>sneaking glances over to watch, flashed an infuriating smile
        <p></p>and looked away again. Clearly, he did not intend to offer
        <p></p>any help for the time being.
        <p></p>"So how did you and Shiina get to know each other in the
        <p></p>first place? You mentioned you've been hanging out since
        <p></p>last year, but what did you guys even have in common?"
        <p></p>"Ah, well, how do I explain…? I just happened to lend her
        <p></p>an umbrella when she was caught in the rain. A lot has
        <p></p>happened since then, but that was the reason we started
        <p></p>spending time together."
        <p></p>"That's all?!"
        <p></p>"Th-that's all? I mean, well, after that we got to know each
        <p></p>other, and Mahiru couldn't stand that I was such a slob, so
        <p></p>she started taking care of me."
        <p></p>"You sure are a lucky guy!"
        <p></p>"Well, I won't deny that."
        <p></p>Quite the series of coincidences had brought them
        <p></p>together.
        <p></p>If Mahiru hadn't gotten a phone call from her mother that
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>day, or if Amane hadn't noticed his surroundings, or if he
        <p></p>had taken a hot shower after lending her his umbrella like he
        <p></p>should have, or if he'd displayed any kind of ulterior
        <p></p>motives, Amane's and Mahiru's fates would never have
        <p></p>become linked. If just one of those elements had turned out
        <p></p>differently, their present relationship probably never would
        <p></p>have come to be.
        <p></p>And so he had no doubt that the fact they formed a
        <p></p>connection was nothing short of a small miracle.
        <p></p>Amane shrugged and chuckled while frowning anxiously,
        <p></p>and the classmate in front of him sighed quietly.
        <p></p>"…I don't mean to put you down, but I don't understand
        <p></p>why the angel fell for you, Fujimiya. If it was a matter of
        <p></p>looks or brains, surely there would be other choices. Now we
        <p></p>know how you met, but what caused her to start liking you?"
        <p></p>"I honestly have no idea why she likes me—or even when
        <p></p>she started…"
        <p></p>Amane knew she cared about him, but he did not
        <p></p>specifically understand when Mahiru had started having
        <p></p>feelings for him. He didn't know how to respond to their
        <p></p>questions as Mahiru was probably the only one who knew
        <p></p>the answers.
        <p></p>Amane could only smile ambiguously, and a few of his
        <p></p>classmates—the ones who had started speaking to him since
        <p></p>he'd helped them during Mahiru's study session the week
        <p></p>prior—laughed a little.
        <p></p>"Well, I wonder if it isn't this? Fujimiya is a calm guy, he
        <p></p>really pays attention to the people around him, and he's
        <p></p>always looking out for everyone. Maybe that's why?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Shiina doesn't seem like she would go for the boisterous
        <p></p>type, so maybe you're right. She would probably prefer
        <p></p>someone who makes her feel at ease when they spend time
        <p></p>together over someone who's more energetic, right? And
        <p></p>Fujimiya can be blunt, but he wouldn't make fun of his
        <p></p>partner or do hurtful stuff on purpose. He's probably nice to
        <p></p>be around."
        <p></p>"Actually, now that I think about it, Fujimiya has always
        <p></p>been concerned about Shiina, hasn't he? That was true at the
        <p></p>study session, and during cooking class, and at Sports Day,
        <p></p>too. He's always been watching out for her, like a
        <p></p>gentleman."
        <p></p>"That is a very Fujimiya-like way of taking care of Shiina."
        <p></p>Two of Amane's classmates talked about him like he
        <p></p>wasn't even there.
        <p></p>Amane could feel himself getting flustered, and he glared
        <p></p>at them. "Seriously… Imano, Yamazaki, gimme a break."
        <p></p>But his classmates showed no signs of flinching back from
        <p></p>Amane's piercing gaze.
        <p></p>"He's probably trying to hide his embarrassment."
        <p></p>"So he's not being up-front with us, I see."
        <p></p>"You guys…"
        <p></p>Just as Amane was thinking that he might have preferred
        <p></p>it if they had been making fun of him rather than singing his
        <p></p>praises, he heard a familiar voice, laughing from outside the
        <p></p>circle.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Ah-ha-ha! Well, Amane's a hard nut to crack, but he is
        <p></p>nice, and pretty gentle, which couldn't have hurt with
        <p></p>Mahiru."
        <p></p>"That's right… What are you doing here, Shirakawa?!"
        <p></p>Chitose, who hadn't been in the classroom until now, had
        <p></p>suddenly poked her head in.
        <p></p>"Huh? Lunch break is almost over, and I got a tip that
        <p></p>while we were gone, you guys ganged up on Amane, so we
        <p></p>came back to check it out. By the way, Mahiru herself is
        <p></p>here, too, guys."
        <p></p>"S-sorry."
        <p></p>Mahiru, the focus of the conversation, apologized as she
        <p></p>returned.
        <p></p>The students still had afternoon classes to get through, so
        <p></p>of course Mahiru would return to the classroom, and she
        <p></p>would notice them talking about her when she did. That
        <p></p>should have been obvious, but it didn't seem to have
        <p></p>occurred to anyone.
        <p></p>When Amane glanced over in Itsuki's direction, Itsuki
        <p></p>waved his smartphone. Apparently he had been the one to
        <p></p>call the girls back. Amane didn't know whether he should be
        <p></p>grateful or angry that Itsuki hadn't jumped into the
        <p></p>conversation himself.
        <p></p>Mahiru saw that Amane was surrounded, and she put on
        <p></p>an anxious smile as she walked over to him. Mahiru, who
        <p></p>had spent the day completely attached to his side, ignored
        <p></p>the eyes fixed on her.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Sounds like you haven't been straightforward with
        <p></p>them," she told Amane. "…It's hard to put an answer into
        <p></p>words, if you ask me why I started liking Amane. But he
        <p></p>accepts me for everything that I am, and he respects and
        <p></p>cherishes me, so I guess that's it." Her voice was calm, with
        <p></p>an affectionate tone.
        <p></p>"As I've said before, Amane may seem cold at first glance,
        <p></p>but on the inside, he's gentle, kind, and chivalrous. He's
        <p></p>supported me through tough times and doesn't give easy,
        <p></p>superficial encouragement. He sees me for who I am and has
        <p></p>shown me who he is through his actions. He's also accepted
        <p></p>all of my flaws. On top of that, he has encouraged me and
        <p></p>helped me until I could stand on my own. It would be
        <p></p>stranger if I hadn't fallen for someone like that… It was
        <p></p>enough to convince me that he's the only one for me."
        <p></p>Amane felt his face burning up as he realized Mahiru was
        <p></p>saying that she had been attracted to him since that time
        <p></p>over spring break, when he had seen her with her mother.
        <p></p>He had been meaning to ask her when exactly she had
        <p></p>first started liking him, and what she liked about him, but he
        <p></p>had never expected to hear the answer this way, in public,
        <p></p>lovingly detailed and delivered with a joyful yet bashful look
        <p></p>on her face.
        <p></p>Amane was filled with the urge to bolt from the room.
        <p></p>"Amane is the person who accepts me, cares for me,
        <p></p>respects me, and looks out for me," Mahiru continued. "He's
        <p></p>shy and a little blunt but always kind. The more I get to
        <p></p>know him, the more I like him."
        <p></p>"M-Mahiru, please stop there."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Of course, it would be a lie to say he doesn't have any bad
        <p></p>points," she added. "He's pretty hopeless when it comes to
        <p></p>taking care of himself, and he suffers from a dire lack of
        <p></p>confidence… But recently he's been working hard and
        <p></p>getting better, which is just great, in my opinion, and it's
        <p></p>really cute that he thinks so highly of me and gets a little
        <p></p>intimidated— Mmph!"
        <p></p>"…Please, have mercy!"
        <p></p>Amane was sure he would die of shame if she told them
        <p></p>anything more, so in the middle of Mahiru's sentence, he
        <p></p>interrupted her by clamping one hand over her mouth. But it
        <p></p>was already too late, and the embarrassment was agonizing.
        <p></p>But Amane was not the only one with a red face.
        <p></p>The other students surrounding them, who had all
        <p></p>listened to Mahiru's rambling about her sweetheart, were
        <p></p>also slightly flushed. Everyone was looking around as if they
        <p></p>couldn't stand to be there any longer.
        <p></p>"Why would you say stuff like that?"
        <p></p>"I thought I should use the opportunity to explain how
        <p></p>much I like you," Mahiru answered, "and to call attention to
        <p></p>your good points, to keep you and the other boys from
        <p></p>fighting."
        <p></p>"Well, I don't think it was such a good idea… Plus, a lot of
        <p></p>the stuff you said was really embarrassing!"
        <p></p>"What part?"
        <p></p>"…The last bit."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Well, it's the truth. Of course, those things about you are
        <p></p>great, too. I find your flaws just as charming."
        <p></p>"Stop it. Even if that's true, I seriously won't last if you do
        <p></p>that again."
        <p></p>Amane bit his lip. It was a complicated feeling, listening
        <p></p>to his girlfriend list his shortcomings in front of everybody.
        <p></p>From beside him came a reserved little giggle.
        <p></p>"You don't get to laugh; you're just as new at this as I am,"
        <p></p>Amane grumbled in a voice only Mahiru could hear, and
        <p></p>then he turned away. When he did, Mahiru punched his arm
        <p></p>very gently, so she seemed to have some self-awareness.
        <p></p>As Amane was trying to regain his composure after her
        <p></p>adorable attack, a soft clapping echoed through the
        <p></p>classroom. Chitose was standing there staring at them,
        <p></p>hands held together.
        <p></p>"Okay, okay, flirting time is over! The damage is done…
        <p></p>Unless there's a challenger among you gentlemen who
        <p></p>thinks he can force his way between these two deeply
        <p></p>infatuated lovers?"
        <p></p>"Impossible."
        <p></p>"I don't think any of us could win."
        <p></p>"You mean we'd get our asses kicked."
        <p></p>The other boys shook their heads despondently at
        <p></p>Chitose's challenge.
        <p></p>Amane, too, hung his head, defeated.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>He'd never expected Mahiru to say so much—and in front
        <p></p>of everyone, as well. His heart could barely take it. When he
        <p></p>looked over at her, wishing he could just disappear from the
        <p></p>shame, he saw Mahiru was wearing a smile that was full of
        <p></p>confidence and joy.
        <p></p>"Oh, Shiina…" One of the girls in their class, who had
        <p></p>been watching the whole scene unfurl from the background,
        <p></p>stepped forward to address Mahiru. "How do I put this…?
        <p></p>When you're with someone you really care about, you're just
        <p></p>like any other ordinary girl, huh?"
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes widened at first, then she gave a smile that
        <p></p>was innocent and impish.
        <p></p>"I mean, I am just a normal girl," she asserted without
        <p></p>hesitation, before looking coyly over at Amane again. He
        <p></p>wondered whether this might actually make her more
        <p></p>popular…then ruffled her hair to hide his embarrassment.
        <p></p>The rest of the day felt extremely long, probably because
        <p></p>people kept staring at them.
        <p></p>Although they had deliberately made a display of
        <p></p>themselves, it was nevertheless mentally exhausting to be
        <p></p>the focus of so much attention, some of which was certainly
        <p></p>unfriendly.
        <p></p>By the time the day's lessons finally ended, Amane felt
        <p></p>drained.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, let's go home," he called to her. She was also
        <p></p>getting ready to head out.
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru were, as always, part of the "go-home
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>club." Apparently, Mahiru didn't participate in clubs because
        <p></p>she worried there would be problems if she joined. She
        <p></p>thought her presence might be too much of a distraction.
        <p></p>She'd made that choice precisely because she was aware of
        <p></p>her effect on people, but Amane was a little sad that she felt
        <p></p>compelled to hold back for such a reason.
        <p></p>Mahiru herself didn't seem bothered by it. She had even
        <p></p>pointed out that not being in a club had allowed her to meet
        <p></p>Amane in the first place, which had only embarrassed him
        <p></p>more.
        <p></p>Mahiru finished gathering up her things and gave Amane
        <p></p>a soft smile. "Okay, sorry for making you wait."
        <p></p>Amane felt his expression relax as well. Before, they had
        <p></p>always had to go home separately, but now he was happy
        <p></p>they could walk back side by side.
        <p></p>"We're headed out; is that okay?"
        <p></p>As he picked up Mahiru's bag from where she'd set it on
        <p></p>his desk, Amane spoke to Itsuki, who was beside him. Yuuta
        <p></p>had club activities to attend, so he had already disappeared
        <p></p>from the classroom.
        <p></p>"Mm, well, I would feel bad for butting in on the
        <p></p>newlyweds, so you two go on and flirt as much as you like on
        <p></p>your way back home," Itsuki answered.
        <p></p>"We are not newlyweds, dumbass."
        <p></p>"Yeah, I know, you're more like an old married couple."
        <p></p>"That's not what I mean."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane glared at his friend for talking nonsense, but Itsuki
        <p></p>didn't seem to pay him any mind. Instead, he cheerfully
        <p></p>answered Amane's sharp look with his usual flippant grin.
        <p></p>"No matter how you slice it, that's just how you seem.
        <p></p>Don't you think so, too, Chi?"
        <p></p>"Totally!" Chitose agreed.
        <p></p>"You're so nosy! Or is that the duty of the cringe couple?"
        <p></p>"Oh, big words! We're the original, so I'm crowning you
        <p></p>two 'cringe couple the second.'"
        <p></p>"Unbelievable…"
        <p></p>"Now, now, Amane, calm down."
        <p></p>Amane wanted to flick Itsuki right in the forehead, but
        <p></p>Mahiru stepped in to mediate, so he gave up on the idea.
        <p></p>"And you, Mr. Akazawa, please don't tease Amane so
        <p></p>much."
        <p></p>"Mahiru…"
        <p></p>"Amane can't be honest about his feelings, so when you
        <p></p>tease him, he gets sulky. So please, go easy on him, okay?"
        <p></p>"Mahiru, not you, too?"
        <p></p>"I'm only kidding…"
        <p></p>Amane had conflicting feelings about Mahiru joining in
        <p></p>on everyone's teasing. But seeing her at school with a
        <p></p>genuine, happy smile, he couldn't bring himself to put a stop
        <p></p>to it.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>She had always worn the beautiful, angelic, fake smile that
        <p></p>everyone admired, with her true one hidden behind it. There
        <p></p>was no way Amane was going to condemn the comfortable,
        <p></p>lively demeanor that she had now.
        <p></p>That said, he knew he wouldn't be satisfied until he got
        <p></p>her back for the teasing, so he intended to make her pay
        <p></p>once they arrived home.
        <p></p>"Come on, Amane, let's head back." Mahiru seemed to
        <p></p>have sensed something and hurriedly urged him to leave, so
        <p></p>Amane smiled and took her hand.
        <p></p>"Okay."
        <p></p>"One reason I'm glad we made our relationship public is
        <p></p>that we can go shopping together now," Mahiru said softly as
        <p></p>they were picking out ingredients for that evening's meal in
        <p></p>the supermarket.
        <p></p>The supermarket wasn't really a place where high school
        <p></p>couples went together, and they hadn't planned for it to be a
        <p></p>date, but they needed to prepare for dinner, so the two of
        <p></p>them stopped by.
        <p></p>"Yeah, I guess we couldn't really go together before, huh?"
        <p></p>"Right. But from now on, we can go shopping and do
        <p></p>other things together openly."
        <p></p>"Yeah, we can. And if you like, we can even talk about the
        <p></p>menu."
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>Generally, they decided on the menu ahead of time, but
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>going forward, if there was something Amane suddenly
        <p></p>wanted to eat, he could point it out in the store.
        <p></p>Originally, they had planned to make a Japanese-style
        <p></p>meal that night, but Amane had seen the lunch of the day at
        <p></p>the school cafeteria and told Mahiru that he wanted to have
        <p></p>fried chicken instead. So she was going to grant his wish.
        <p></p>She placed a carefully selected package of chicken thighs
        <p></p>into the basket that Amane was holding and said, "We've
        <p></p>had meat for the last few meals, so a seafood dish would be
        <p></p>nice for tomorrow, don't you think?" Mahiru was already
        <p></p>planning the next night's dinner as well. "What do you think,
        <p></p>Amane?"
        <p></p>"Well, anything is fine… But that's not super helpful,
        <p></p>yeah? Let's see, I think I'd like to eat some mackerel."
        <p></p>"It's in season now, so that should be perfect. All right, I'll
        <p></p>make roasted spicy mackerel. You don't like too much
        <p></p>vinegar, right?"
        <p></p>"Mm-hmm."
        <p></p>Amane smiled and remarked on how well she knew him,
        <p></p>and Mahiru responded bashfully, "Well, I have been making
        <p></p>you dinner for more than half a year."
        <p></p>Amane had indeed been eating with Mahiru for more than
        <p></p>six months, and she'd had plenty of time to get to know his
        <p></p>preferences. The better part of the year had gone by since
        <p></p>they had started spending time together, and Amane felt
        <p></p>moved reminiscing about it.
        <p></p>"…It's amazing to think that we've been hanging out for
        <p></p>half a year," he said.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"It certainly seemed like a long time from my perspective,
        <p></p>you know? Since you were so obtuse and pretended not to
        <p></p>see the truth, even after you noticed how I felt," Mahiru
        <p></p>answered.
        <p></p>"Uh… I said I was sorry."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, I didn't mean to pick on you… Now that I know
        <p></p>how you really feel, it's all right."
        <p></p>Amane felt a little uncomfortable as Mahiru gave him an
        <p></p>impish smile. But he knew that it was his own fault for
        <p></p>failing to make a move in the first place. There was nothing
        <p></p>to do but admit his shortcomings.
        <p></p>"Well, from now on, I'll make sure to express my love
        <p></p>more openly."
        <p></p>"Thank you very much. I'll do the same."
        <p></p>"…Although if you do it too much, things will get difficult
        <p></p>for me, so please do it in moderation."
        <p></p>"What do you mean by difficult?"
        <p></p>"…Please don't bring out my inner animal."
        <p></p>If Mahiru continued to spoil Amane, his brain might cease
        <p></p>to function, so he didn't want her to take it too far.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to take his meaning. He could practically
        <p></p>see the blood rushing to her face as she answered him in a
        <p></p>docile voice, "I-I'll be careful…"
        <p></p>Amane nodded, feeling his own face turning red. "Yeah."
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 57: Change of Circumstance, Change of Attitude 
        <p></p>"Say, Itsuki?"
        <p></p>"What is it, my friend?"
        <p></p>"…Would you say Mahiru has somehow gotten even more
        <p></p>popular since we started dating?"
        <p></p>Amane muttered these words as he watched his girlfriend
        <p></p>cheerfully talk with a cluster of classmates who had
        <p></p>surrounded her in their classroom.
        <p></p>"Sure would," Itsuki affirmed.
        <p></p>Several days had passed since Amane and Mahiru had
        <p></p>started dating, and Mahiru's popularity showed no signs of
        <p></p>declining. It actually seemed to be increasing.
        <p></p>It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say Mahiru had always
        <p></p>been the most popular person in their class, but now there
        <p></p>were even more people hovering around her.
        <p></p>Amane was grateful that there seemed to be more girls
        <p></p>than boys in the crowd, although he did have mixed feelings
        <p></p>about the passionate looks the boys were giving her.
        <p></p>"Well, it's pretty obvious why she's more popular than
        <p></p>ever," Itsuki added.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"And why is that?"
        <p></p>"How do I put this…? Up to now, it was like she existed on
        <p></p>the other side of a glass showcase, but now she seems more
        <p></p>approachable somehow. I think it's because their idol, the
        <p></p>unattainable Miss Shiina, has shown that she's actually just
        <p></p>an ordinary girl by being with a guy like you, Amane."
        <p></p>Sure enough, the nature of Mahiru's smile had changed
        <p></p>since she started dating Amane. Of course, she still had her
        <p></p>angelic smile, but she had started to show her true face as
        <p></p>well; she was frequently showing the innocent face of a girl
        <p></p>her age.
        <p></p>It was happening gradually, but she was behaving less like
        <p></p>the angel and showing more of her real self. That made
        <p></p>Amane happy to see, but at the same time, he felt a little bit
        <p></p>uneasy about having to share another secret.
        <p></p>He had asked her to do it, to show everyone that she was
        <p></p>an ordinary girl, but now that it was happening, he felt
        <p></p>depressed to see it and hated himself for his own
        <p></p>inconsistency.
        <p></p>"How can I explain it? I really feel conflicted," Amane
        <p></p>said, "seeing her true self in public when it used to be
        <p></p>something private and special. I know I ought to be happy
        <p></p>about it, but somehow, I feel depressed. I think I'm being
        <p></p>petty, even for me."
        <p></p>"That's your possessiveness materializing… But look, it's
        <p></p>not like the face she has on now is everything, right? I'm
        <p></p>sure she has plenty of faces that she only shows to you."
        <p></p>"Yeah, I guess."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>The look of embarrassment mixed with happiness that
        <p></p>she made when he touched her, the discontented expression
        <p></p>with both cheeks puffed out like little balloons when she was
        <p></p>pouting, the soft, sweet smile she put on whenever he
        <p></p>pampered her, like a sponge that had soaked up a load of
        <p></p>honey—all these were faces she showed only to Amane.
        <p></p>"Besides, you're the one who changed her. That smile
        <p></p>exists because of you, so don't lose your nerve now. 'Look at
        <p></p>how cute my Mahiru is!'—that's how you should be acting."
        <p></p>"…I can't exactly call her 'my Mahiru,' but I'll try not to get
        <p></p>jealous."
        <p></p>"What do you mean, you can't say that she's yours? After
        <p></p>flirting like that in front of everyone?"
        <p></p>"Well, that was… We didn't do it on purpose."
        <p></p>"It would have been pretty bold if you had! And even if it
        <p></p>wasn't on purpose, it still shows just how much you like each
        <p></p>other. Enough to make waves. Look around you, man!"
        <p></p>Itsuki poked Amane in the forehead, and Amane pressed his
        <p></p>lips together into a tight line.
        <p></p>Recently, for some reason, some of their classmates had
        <p></p>taken to blushing or looking around restlessly whenever
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru were nearby. Even when they weren't
        <p></p>touching very much or talking about anything important,
        <p></p>their presence made them blush. Amane did not understand.
        <p></p>He did receive a fair number of looks of jealousy, but
        <p></p>more and more, the stares he was getting were lukewarm.
        <p></p>According to one male classmate, who had previously
        <p></p>turned on him in jealousy, the fact that he and Mahiru were
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>so close was making other people feel hopeless.
        <p></p>It was embarrassing to hear, even from outsiders, that
        <p></p>Mahiru only had eyes for him, but it also made him a little
        <p></p>happy.
        <p></p>"Well, I guess she's also showing off that she's her own
        <p></p>person and not obsessed with you."
        <p></p>"I'm not worth obsessing over. I don't stand out as much
        <p></p>as Mahiru, and I don't want people to pay attention to me. I
        <p></p>don't know what to do when that happens."
        <p></p>"…Well, you might not stand out, but you're still a solid
        <p></p>guy. I don't need to talk about your academics, and you are a
        <p></p>little sarcastic, but fundamentally, you're a gentleman and
        <p></p>the kind of honest guy who doesn't turn his back on people.
        <p></p>From the perspective of a girl who's looking for some
        <p></p>stability, I bet you look like a good catch."
        <p></p>"It's kinda…weird hearing you talk about me like that…"
        <p></p>"Okay, that's a fifty-point penalty for bad-mouthing me.
        <p></p>Now then, you never say what you're thinking, so people
        <p></p>assume you're unsociable, but that's just perception, and
        <p></p>personality-wise, you are surprisingly straightforward."
        <p></p>"A sure sign that I'm screwed up."
        <p></p>Even though Amane had been sulking less and less, he
        <p></p>was still convinced that he had a bad personality.
        <p></p>He felt like the compliments about being sincere and a
        <p></p>good person would be better directed toward a
        <p></p>straightforward, agreeable young man like Yuuta, rather
        <p></p>than a guy like himself, who had a warped view of the world.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"In my opinion, you're super easy to read and have an
        <p></p>honest personality. Chi says the same thing, that you're easy
        <p></p>to understand."
        <p></p>"You guys—"
        <p></p>"You go on and on about being screwed up or whatever,
        <p></p>but you're a straight shooter and a considerate guy, I think.
        <p></p>You're a little sarcastic, though."
        <p></p>"Oh, I'm so sorry."
        <p></p>Amane turned away peevishly, and Itsuki laughed out
        <p></p>loud and slapped his shoulder. Amane jabbed him back
        <p></p>gently with his elbow and mumbled quietly, "Thanks, man."
        <p></p>"You've gotten easier to talk to since you started dating
        <p></p>Shiina, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>It seemed Mahiru wasn't the only one experiencing a
        <p></p>change in her social life. Amane's environment was
        <p></p>changing, too.
        <p></p>Before getting together with Mahiru, Amane had rarely
        <p></p>spoken to anyone other than his closest friends. Besides
        <p></p>simple greetings or when it was required for schoolwork, not
        <p></p>many people had ever gone out of their way to speak to him,
        <p></p>either. But since he and Mahiru had started dating, people
        <p></p>had begun to speak to him more frequently.
        <p></p>"…I have?"
        <p></p>Amane was helping out a female classmate who had
        <p></p>gotten stuck with cleaning the classroom because the boy
        <p></p>who was originally supposed to do it was absent. She was
        <p></p>worried about being late to her part-time job.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>He wasn't sure how to reply to her sudden assertion, so he
        <p></p>shrugged in response.
        <p></p>Mahiru had meant to help as well, but another girl had
        <p></p>approached her to ask for some advice, and they were
        <p></p>chatting in a corner of the classroom.
        <p></p>Mahiru was very caring that way, as she had always been,
        <p></p>and as her boyfriend, he found it very charming, but he also
        <p></p>thought it looked like a difficult thing to do.
        <p></p>As she smoothly wrote down the day's events in the class
        <p></p>log, the girl on duty for the day glanced over at Amane's face
        <p></p>while he finished tidying up the classroom and cleaning the
        <p></p>blackboard, and she smiled.
        <p></p>"You've really changed, you know? Actually, before you
        <p></p>had your makeover, you were difficult to approach. You gave
        <p></p>off an aura that said 'Don't talk to me.' I wondered if you
        <p></p>might have some kind of social anxiety."
        <p></p>"Sorry about that."
        <p></p>"Ah-ha-ha, I don't know what to do with that apology. It's
        <p></p>just part of your personality, so I wasn't trying to criticize
        <p></p>you, all right? I just figured that you're the type to keep your
        <p></p>friend circle small but tight-knit. That's why I thought it was
        <p></p>interesting you got along with Kadowaki. And now you've
        <p></p>gone through an image change, and a few days have passed.
        <p></p>You're the same guy you've always been, but I can tell you're
        <p></p>just starting to become more social."
        <p></p>"…You're very observant, Kido."
        <p></p>"Well, it's just one of my hobbies, so…"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane was surprised that she had been paying quite a bit
        <p></p>of attention to him. He didn't know her that well, though she
        <p></p>seemed a lot like Chitose, a person who was often at the
        <p></p>center of things, lifting the mood with her bright smile. She
        <p></p>was popular in a different way from Mahiru—and that
        <p></p>summed up what he knew about this girl, Ayaka Kido.
        <p></p>Amane had never interacted with her before, so his
        <p></p>impressions of her were based purely on observation, but
        <p></p>apparently she had been watching him carefully, even
        <p></p>though she had never directly talked with him until now.
        <p></p>"…Well, you noticed an awful lot, even though I kept
        <p></p>myself shut away."
        <p></p>"For Shiina's sake?"
        <p></p>"No, not for her sake, but for my own."
        <p></p>Mahiru had never wished for him to change, and he
        <p></p>wasn't going to claim she was responsible for his new
        <p></p>behavior. The desire to change had come from Amane
        <p></p>himself.
        <p></p>"It was thanks to Mahiru that I decided to change, but it
        <p></p>wasn't for her," he explained. "I wanted to be by her side, so
        <p></p>I stopped closing myself off; that's all. I did everything for
        <p></p>my own sake."
        <p></p>Amane was confident that Mahiru would have liked him
        <p></p>just the same even before he plucked up the courage to take
        <p></p>these steps, but even so, he wanted to feel proud that he had
        <p></p>made the decision to change for himself.
        <p></p>He felt that he wanted to put in the effort to better himself
        <p></p>so he would be suitable enough to walk by Mahiru's side. To
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>put it into words, it was nothing more than his own selfsatisfaction. It was Amane's decision; it had not been
        <p></p>something Mahiru had asked for. Amane asserted he had
        <p></p>done it for himself.
        <p></p>Ayaka, who looked to have finished writing her log entry,
        <p></p>was smiling happily. "Shiina sure is lucky, huh?"
        <p></p>"…How did we get on this topic?"
        <p></p>"Oh-hoh-hoh, it's just what we were talking about!"
        <p></p>Amane felt like his cheek was about to start twitching.
        <p></p>Ayaka was grinning cheerfully, but there wasn't so much as a
        <p></p>hint of teasing in her eyes, so he couldn't get mad at her.
        <p></p>"Well, just from that, I can tell you're devoted, mister. If
        <p></p>you didn't care for her, you wouldn't try to change. I think
        <p></p>it's amazing you would work so hard for the person you
        <p></p>love… Oh, you don't like it worded that way, do you? That
        <p></p>you would work hard to match her. That's love, real love."
        <p></p>"…It's not a bad thing…right?"
        <p></p>"Oh no, it's good, it's good! I'm sure Shiina can also tell
        <p></p>that you care about her a lot. Actually, she's looking over
        <p></p>here right now."
        <p></p>When Amane glanced at the corner of the classroom at
        <p></p>Ayaka's urging, he saw Mahiru waiting there quietly, alone,
        <p></p>apparently finished with her conversation. She was wearing
        <p></p>a slightly anxious expression, probably because he was
        <p></p>having a heartfelt talk with another girl.
        <p></p>"She's looking right at you, huh?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"She sure is."
        <p></p>"Make sure she doesn't misunderstand this, okay? I've got
        <p></p>my own boyfriend, so I wasn't trying to make her jealous or
        <p></p>anything."
        <p></p>Ayaka laughed, and at the same moment, almost as if it
        <p></p>had been timed, a guy's voice called for her from outside the
        <p></p>classroom.
        <p></p>"Ayaka, you done yet? You'll be late for work."
        <p></p>"Sou? Wait up, I'll just go turn this in!"
        <p></p>That reminded Amane that she had a part-time job to
        <p></p>rush to, yet she hadn't seemed to be in too much of a hurry.
        <p></p>Not enough to prevent her from hanging around having a
        <p></p>leisurely chat with the boy anyway.
        <p></p>He made eye contact with Ayaka, and she responded with
        <p></p>a playful wink.
        <p></p>"Thanks for helping me out, Fujimiya. Um, as thanks…
        <p></p>this is all I have, sorry. See ya!"
        <p></p>In one very swift motion, Ayaka pulled something out of
        <p></p>her bag, placed it in the palm of Amane's hand, turned, and
        <p></p>trotted out of the classroom.
        <p></p>Thinking that the girl was like a passing storm, Amane
        <p></p>looked down at the thing she'd handed him and saw it was a
        <p></p>chocolate bar packed with protein puffs—the kind that Yuuta
        <p></p>had suggested he ought to eat after working out.
        <p></p>"She didn't need to thank me… And why did she choose
        <p></p>this?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane stared at the door that Ayaka had left through,
        <p></p>wondering why she'd been carrying the bar around in the
        <p></p>first place, and whether by offering it to him she'd meant to
        <p></p>say that he was too thin and needed to put on more muscle.
        <p></p>Meanwhile, Mahiru approached him.
        <p></p>She didn't look upset, exactly, but she was making an
        <p></p>expression like she had something to say.
        <p></p>"…You look like you really want to say something."
        <p></p>"D-don't take this to mean I don't trust you, okay? But you
        <p></p>looked like you were enjoying your conversation, so I was
        <p></p>wondering what you were talking about…"
        <p></p>As one might expect, Mahiru seemed to be uneasy about
        <p></p>her boyfriend talking to another girl.
        <p></p>Amane never had the intention of making Mahiru feel
        <p></p>that way and had figured she would have recognized that it
        <p></p>was just small talk even from the other side of the room, but
        <p></p>if she had been worried about it, he thought he ought to
        <p></p>apologize.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Sorry for worrying you. She was just telling me how
        <p></p>much I've changed. Even from Kido's perspective, I must
        <p></p>look really different."
        <p></p>Naturally, Amane was embarrassed to tell her that he and
        <p></p>Kido had discussed matters regarding love, so he
        <p></p>intentionally omitted that from his explanation, but he was
        <p></p>able to tell Mahiru the main thrust of their conversation.
        <p></p>He stroked her hair as he spoke slowly, and she seemed to
        <p></p>calm down a little. Her troubled frown slowly softened into a
        <p></p>smile. Recently, Amane had figured out that Mahiru liked it
        <p></p>when they touched.
        <p></p>"Well, she's right. When it comes to appearance, you've
        <p></p>turned into a handsome young man. It's a very clear
        <p></p>difference from before."
        <p></p>"I did come off as gloomy, so I guess it's a big difference."
        <p></p>"Sure, because the previous Amane was a quiet guy with
        <p></p>an almost impenetrable reserve. Your old look made you
        <p></p>seem completely unapproachable… But if she said you've
        <p></p>changed, she probably meant something personality-wise,
        <p></p>huh?"
        <p></p>"Well, she said I was easier to talk to now."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh. That's just because you've never been very
        <p></p>assertive. You never have trouble when someone else starts
        <p></p>the conversation. So when you announced that you were
        <p></p>dating me, it was a signal for everyone to come talk to you.
        <p></p>And now that you've talked with others more, they've
        <p></p>realized you're easy to get along with. That's what I think, at
        <p></p>least. Also, you've mellowed out, compared to before."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru poked at Amane's cheek with her fingertip, getting
        <p></p>back at him for tussling her hair. It tickled, and he felt
        <p></p>humiliated by it, so he grabbed her hand and pushed it away
        <p></p>from his face.
        <p></p>Instead, he squeezed her hand, then entwined his fingers
        <p></p>with hers and tapped the tips of his fingers against the back
        <p></p>of her hand, satisfying her craving for physical contact.
        <p></p>Mahiru, who was wearing a more comfortable smile than
        <p></p>before, leaned in and whispered, "Amane, you've also been
        <p></p>smiling more lately."
        <p></p>In his embarrassment, Amane averted his gaze from
        <p></p>Mahiru.
        <p></p>"…I think that changed because I've been spending time
        <p></p>with you. Also, if you're going to say that, I should mention
        <p></p>that you seem easier to talk to than before, too."
        <p></p>"If that's true, it's because I've been spending time with
        <p></p>you."
        <p></p>"…Oh really, now?"
        <p></p>"That's right."
        <p></p>He could tell she was smiling happily without even
        <p></p>looking at her. Keeping his face turned away, Amane
        <p></p>kneaded her hand energetically, as if in payback—and to
        <p></p>distract from his obvious bashfulness.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 58: Something that Can’t Be Concealed 
        <p></p>By late June, the rainy season was at its peak, and there
        <p></p>was a string of days when the weather alternated between
        <p></p>clear and stormy.
        <p></p>Droplets of rain fell steadily from a gray and gloomy sky,
        <p></p>and the air felt thick and dismal. Everyone was feeling
        <p></p>cooped up, probably because the color of the sky was even
        <p></p>darker than it had been before.
        <p></p>"…Yuck, it's so muggy!"
        <p></p>"Well, it is the rainy season."
        <p></p>It was only to be expected that the school was also filled
        <p></p>with a listless atmosphere. All the members of the sports
        <p></p>clubs were sopping wet from practicing outside, which
        <p></p>added to the dreariness.
        <p></p>Even Chitose, who loved to run around energetically
        <p></p>despite not being a member of any sports club, seemed to
        <p></p>have met her match and had collapsed limply down in her
        <p></p>seat, where she lay flopped across her desk. Amane hadn't
        <p></p>seen her so drained since last year's rainy season. Even her
        <p></p>hairstyle was different.
        <p></p>Chitose usually wore her hair down, but on that day, she
        <p></p>had it tied into two frizzy bunches—wild from the humidity
        <p></p>—with one behind each ear. Despite her efforts to control it,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>from time to time, a stray lock would escape from the
        <p></p>confines of its hair band. There was no doubt that she had
        <p></p>struggled considerably to tie it in the first place.
        <p></p>"You seem to be doing just fine, Amane."
        <p></p>"Hmm, well, I do usually prefer a quieter atmosphere. I
        <p></p>could do without the humidity, though."
        <p></p>"Good for you. I can't stand it when it's like this. It makes
        <p></p>me want to run around screaming."
        <p></p>"The ground is in bad shape, so you'll have to wait until
        <p></p>the weather clears up to go wild. If you fell, you'd hurt
        <p></p>yourself and your clothes would get covered in mud."
        <p></p>"It would never come out in the wash… I'll sit tight, but
        <p></p>man…"
        <p></p>Even her voice seemed dulled by the rainy weather.
        <p></p>Considering Chitose was so terribly weary, Amane
        <p></p>wondered how Mahiru was doing. He could see her chatting
        <p></p>with a group of girls, wearing a gentle smile. Somehow, her
        <p></p>expression looked slightly more energetic than usual.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem to notice that Amane was watching her,
        <p></p>and she was enjoying her conversation.
        <p></p>Amane was staring at Mahiru, thinking about how he was
        <p></p>going to spend a lot of time with her when they got home.
        <p></p>Makoto noticed where he was looking and asked, "What,
        <p></p>Fujimiya, you jealous of the girls?"
        <p></p>Makoto always observed his surroundings closely, so it
        <p></p>was no surprise that he had noticed where Amane was
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>looking, but Amane had to smile because the reason his
        <p></p>friend imagined was completely wrong.
        <p></p>"No, I'm not petty enough to be jealous of the girls. It's
        <p></p>just, her hair is different today, so it gives her a new look,
        <p></p>and I was admiring it."
        <p></p>Amane was too embarrassed to say what had actually
        <p></p>been on his mind, so he pivoted to another reason in
        <p></p>response, and Makoto responded in an understanding tone,
        <p></p>"She's got it tied up today, huh?"
        <p></p>Just like Chitose, Mahiru's hair was tied up. But Mahiru's
        <p></p>hair was longer than Chitose's and had a lot of volume, so
        <p></p>she had gathered it all into two braids that hung loosely
        <p></p>down on either side.
        <p></p>She didn't change her hairstyle often, so it had also been a
        <p></p>new look for their classmates. Amane had heard some of the
        <p></p>boys muttering that seeing the angel was like a breath of
        <p></p>fresh air in the suffocating humidity.
        <p></p>"You seem rather chipper, Makoto. I'm jealous, for more
        <p></p>than one reason," Chitose grumbled.
        <p></p>Trying desperately to control her hair, which didn't want
        <p></p>to listen to her in the humidity, Chitose looked jealously at
        <p></p>Makoto's smooth locks, which seemed entirely unbothered
        <p></p>by the damp air. She had also been bugging Amane about his
        <p></p>hair from the moment she'd first seen him that morning; she
        <p></p>seemed incredibly jealous of anyone whose hair was
        <p></p>unaffected by the humidity.
        <p></p>"I'm not exactly chipper. Just not as depressed as
        <p></p>everyone else. I still have trouble with practical stuff when
        <p></p>the rain won't let up, and I'd like the rainy season to end
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>soon. When it's this cloudy, you can't even see the stars."
        <p></p>"Oh right, you're in the astronomy club. I guess when it's
        <p></p>like this, seeing the stars is out of the question."
        <p></p>"I mean, we hardly ever actually go look at the stars as a
        <p></p>club. If we wanted to watch the stars at school, we would
        <p></p>have to get an adviser to accompany us, put in an application
        <p></p>to get access to the roof, and stay at school after hours. It's a
        <p></p>whole thing. As a club, we mostly do research and stuff, then
        <p></p>watch the stars on our own at home. But either way, it seems
        <p></p>like we won't be able to observe anything for a little while. It
        <p></p>sucks."
        <p></p>Makoto frowned in vexation, and Chitose nodded in
        <p></p>agreement. Mahiru seemed to have finished her
        <p></p>conversation and walked over with easy, elegant movements
        <p></p>to stand by Amane's side.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>As Amane quietly pulled out her chair and urged her to
        <p></p>sit, he summarized their conversation to the curious-looking
        <p></p>Mahiru, "We were talking about what a pain the rainy
        <p></p>season is."
        <p></p>Mahiru deftly took her seat in front of Chitose and put on
        <p></p>a sympathetic smile when she heard the words rainy season.
        <p></p>"Well, she has a particularly difficult time with it, don't
        <p></p>you, Chitose?" she said. "It's hard for you to go out and enjoy
        <p></p>yourself, and you can't even go outside to exercise, and your
        <p></p>hair also gets messed up."
        <p></p>"I was certain that Chitose would be bursting with energy
        <p></p>even during the rainy season," Makoto remarked. "But if I
        <p></p>really think back, in middle school, too, you were always
        <p></p>quiet during this time of the year, weren't you? Especially in
        <p></p>second year. It was hard to imagine you'd be as hyper as you
        <p></p>are now."
        <p></p>"Agh, I don't wanna think about middle school!"
        <p></p>Chitose hated talking about things that happened back
        <p></p>then, when she'd been a very different person. She clapped
        <p></p>both hands over her ears and turned away.
        <p></p>Makoto shrugged and said, "I mean, you can be a little
        <p></p>loud, but the way you are now seems to suit you more;
        <p></p>honestly, I think it's better." It wasn't clear whether he was
        <p></p>trying to soothe her or make her angry so she would perk up
        <p></p>again.
        <p></p>"…You trying to pick a fight with me, Makoto?"
        <p></p>"That's not what I meant to do, but…but it's true that
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>you're loud… I mean, lively."
        <p></p>"Don't bother correcting yourself, I know what you
        <p></p>meant!"
        <p></p>Chitose frowned petulantly and beat her fists on her desk.
        <p></p>But her face seemed brighter, maybe because some of her
        <p></p>energy had returned. Makoto had managed to cheer her up
        <p></p>in his own way.
        <p></p>In response to Chitose's huffy fit, Amane caught Mahiru's
        <p></p>eye and smiled inconspicuously.
        <p></p>Ultimately, the rain continued through to the end of the
        <p></p>school day, and the sky was the same forbidding shade when
        <p></p>it was time to go home.
        <p></p>Because of that, the well-traveled road to and from school
        <p></p>was unusually quiet, as most students were in a hurry to get
        <p></p>home.
        <p></p>As for Amane, he drew Mahiru close to him underneath
        <p></p>his large umbrella, sharing it like sweethearts do, and
        <p></p>walked along at a pace that was comfortable for her.
        <p></p>He held Mahiru's bag as always, so it wouldn't get wet.
        <p></p>Maybe because the two of them were alone, Mahiru let out a
        <p></p>slightly disheartened and exhausted-sounding sigh. Amane
        <p></p>glanced over at her.
        <p></p>She noticed his stare and took her bag back from him. "…
        <p></p>It's so humid during the rainy season that your mood gets
        <p></p>somber, too, don't you think?" Mahiru mumbled, playing
        <p></p>absently with the ends of her hair, which were sticking out at
        <p></p>random angles a little more than usual. "And it's hard to do
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>your hair. Mine gives me such trouble, and it tangles easily."
        <p></p>"It sounds like it's more difficult than usual to set it right.
        <p></p>Personally, I think the way you have it today is cute, but I'm
        <p></p>sure it's annoying to deal with."
        <p></p>Amane personally considered getting to see Mahiru style
        <p></p>her hair in lots of different ways to be a perk, but he figured
        <p></p>that, from a girl's perspective, properly arranging it was a
        <p></p>big deal. Especially for Mahiru, who cared about her
        <p></p>personal appearance more than most.
        <p></p>The way she had her hair tied at the moment looked more
        <p></p>subdued and sweeter than usual, but Mahiru herself
        <p></p>probably did not like it all that much.
        <p></p>"C-cute?" After pondering the word, Mahiru's eyes darted
        <p></p>around bashfully, and she slapped Amane's arm with her
        <p></p>fingertips in an attempt to hide her embarrassment. "…
        <p></p>Anyway, it's hard to look after my hair in the summertime,
        <p></p>you know? At the height of summer, there's the problem of
        <p></p>sunlight causing damage, so proper care is essential. In the
        <p></p>winter, it's dry, and in the summer, it's humid, and UV rays
        <p></p>can cause harm… The way I care for it changes depending on
        <p></p>the season and the weather, so it's hard to keep up with."
        <p></p>"Being a girl sounds difficult."
        <p></p>"That's why I'm jealous of your hair, Amane."
        <p></p>Amane blinked when the topic changed to him, and
        <p></p>Mahiru looked up at his hair with slight envy. That morning,
        <p></p>it had seemed like too much work to style his hair with wax,
        <p></p>so all he had done was run a comb through it like he did on
        <p></p>the weekends.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"It's nice and smooth despite the humidity. As far as
        <p></p>grooming, it doesn't demand that much, does it?"
        <p></p>"The most I do is use that shampoo from the beauty
        <p></p>salon."
        <p></p>"That's because your hair was healthy to begin with. If you
        <p></p>took really good care of it, it would be even smoother and
        <p></p>shinier."
        <p></p>"I don't really want that, but… Well, if I have the time, I'll
        <p></p>make the effort."
        <p></p>If it made it more enjoyable for Mahiru to touch his hair,
        <p></p>then he figured making time to take care of it would be
        <p></p>worth it. Not that he was unhappy with it as it was, and
        <p></p>Mahiru never seemed to have a problem with it, either, but if
        <p></p>he thought it might make her even happier, he was glad to
        <p></p>do it.
        <p></p>He looked at Mahiru's face and saw that she had a faint
        <p></p>smile—so faint that it was barely visible. The rain was
        <p></p>obviously affecting her, and there was less vigor in her
        <p></p>expression than usual.
        <p></p>Gazing at her pale cheeks, Amane let out a quiet sigh.
        <p></p>"You know, it really sucks that I can't go jogging in this
        <p></p>weather. I had a routine going, and now I feel like I might
        <p></p>revert to my old idle habits."
        <p></p>It wasn't a good idea to go for a long run while it was
        <p></p>pouring rain. The rain would cool his muscles down even if
        <p></p>he warmed up before running, and he wouldn't get a very
        <p></p>good workout.
        <p></p>And so for the time being, he was going to take a break
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>from running. To compensate, he planned to step up the
        <p></p>weight training for his legs.
        <p></p>"You say that, but haven't you been doing more weight
        <p></p>training than usual already?"
        <p></p>"That's because I don't want to backslide, now that my
        <p></p>efforts are actually starting to show."
        <p></p>"Hee-hee, you're so serious; what a good boy. Very
        <p></p>admirable."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked pleased and softly patted Amane on the
        <p></p>back. It tickled, and with the hand that wasn't holding the
        <p></p>umbrella and his bag, Amane got his revenge by doing the
        <p></p>same to Mahiru.
        <p></p>Afterward, he looked at the sky. The horizon was still
        <p></p>dark, but something about it seemed more pleasant. It was
        <p></p>probably because the rain wasn't as intense as it had been.
        <p></p>Now it seemed to be gently enveloping them.
        <p></p>Of course, the real reason he felt at ease was due to the
        <p></p>person at his side.
        <p></p>"Well, there are some downsides to this weather, but
        <p></p>walking with you in the rain like this isn't bad at all. Rainy
        <p></p>days have their own sort of charm. The color of the sky and
        <p></p>the feeling in the air is unique, and I like it. Taking a quiet
        <p></p>stroll on a day like this seems romantic, too."
        <p></p>The rainy season might be despised by girls who
        <p></p>especially cared about their appearance, but Amane liked it.
        <p></p>It was a quiet time wrapped in a gentle feeling.
        <p></p>He liked the overcast sky giving off a dull, calm light, the
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>gentle sound of rain that tickled his ears, and the faint
        <p></p>fragrance of the rain, with the hydrangeas in full, vivid
        <p></p>bloom as if to decorate the otherwise faded scenery.
        <p></p>The landscape around them wasn't simply dark and
        <p></p>hopeless. The rainy season, and the mood and environment,
        <p></p>felt comfortable to Amane.
        <p></p>Besides, he had Mahiru by his side.
        <p></p>Just by softly squeezing her hand, the world looked
        <p></p>brightly colored again. If he changed his attitude and
        <p></p>focused on Mahiru next to him, the scenery seemed more
        <p></p>peaceful and charming. Just by walking together, the world
        <p></p>looked perfectly lovely.
        <p></p>"The rain was what led to us meeting, so I like it. And I
        <p></p>think that walking through the rain like this with you is a
        <p></p>priceless moment."
        <p></p>This was their first rainy season together as a couple, and
        <p></p>Amane found meaning in the very act of walking side by
        <p></p>side. It felt more precious because he knew that this exact
        <p></p>moment would never come again.
        <p></p>"Besides—"
        <p></p>"Besides?"
        <p></p>"On rainy days, there are more bargain items left at the
        <p></p>supermarket. And there are fewer people out, despite the
        <p></p>sales, so it's easier to pick up good deals!"
        <p></p>As a joke, Amane added the last reason for liking the rain
        <p></p>with a smile. Mahiru looked taken aback, but gradually her
        <p></p>expression also relaxed into a gentle smile.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Hee-hee, that's the sort of thing you learn by living alone
        <p></p>for a long time. I get it, though."
        <p></p>"That's fine; who cares? Some types of knowledge are just
        <p></p>practical to have."
        <p></p>"I'm not saying it's bad, hee-hee-hee."
        <p></p>Mahiru giggled cheerfully, before slowly settling down
        <p></p>and looking up at Amane with quiet eyes.
        <p></p>"Amane, you're someone who can live a quiet and colorful
        <p></p>life, aren't you? You see the beauty and fun in everything
        <p></p>around you."
        <p></p>"I'm not sure what you mean?"
        <p></p>"Oh, I just suddenly had the thought. It's wonderful that
        <p></p>you can find enjoyment in all sorts of things from all sorts of
        <p></p>angles," Mahiru mumbled with a hint of jealousy. She
        <p></p>sounded a little lonesome.
        <p></p>"But I think the only reason everything I see seems to be
        <p></p>so vivid is because you're by my side, Mahiru. Really, you
        <p></p>taught me to see things I had never seen before. And I hope
        <p></p>you keep teaching me, too."
        <p></p>When Amane turned to look directly into Mahiru's
        <p></p>caramel-colored eyes, he could see them waver for a
        <p></p>moment and begin to fill with tears. But they weren't tears of
        <p></p>sadness, and slowly an expression of joy appeared on her
        <p></p>face.
        <p></p>"…I've also learned all sorts of things from you, Amane.
        <p></p>And I'm looking forward to more from now on, too."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"That's good to hear."
        <p></p>He had gotten Mahiru to promise to stay by his side,
        <p></p>whether she realized it or not. He hoped he could keep her to
        <p></p>himself for a long time.
        <p></p>Amane had no intention of giving up his spot beside her,
        <p></p>no matter the cost.
        <p></p>Still holding Mahiru's hand, he smiled, then peered into
        <p></p>her eyes again. She was wearing the most relaxed expression
        <p></p>he had seen on her all day.
        <p></p>"…Well then, let's hurry up and think of something you
        <p></p>can do to enjoy yourself on a rainy day once we get home."
        <p></p>"Like what?"
        <p></p>"How about we buy some small side dishes at the
        <p></p>supermarket, then watch a drama or one of the DVDs I have
        <p></p>at home, or listen to some music and take it easy? On a day
        <p></p>like this, it's best not to work too hard—and to spend time
        <p></p>relaxing. I could tell you weren't feeling too well today,
        <p></p>physically and mentally."
        <p></p>When he stared intently into her caramel-colored eyes, he
        <p></p>could see that he had hit the mark. She flinched, and her
        <p></p>eyes started darting around.
        <p></p>Actually, he had thought something was off when they
        <p></p>had walked to school together that morning and was
        <p></p>convinced once they'd reached the classroom. Mahiru was
        <p></p>not feeling well.
        <p></p>Her usual smile was lacking some of its luster, and
        <p></p>although it was hard to tell because of the dark, dismal,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>rainy atmosphere, her complexion was worse than usual as
        <p></p>well. Moreover, her motions had been just a bit more
        <p></p>deliberate, as if she was trying to move as little as possible.
        <p></p>Whether it had to do with the weather or a feminine issue,
        <p></p>it was a private matter, and he couldn't ask. But it was
        <p></p>obvious that she was feeling lethargic, and she seemed like
        <p></p>she was struggling. Amane wanted to make sure she took it
        <p></p>easy for the rest of the day.
        <p></p>When he looked at Mahiru anxiously, she seemed to have
        <p></p>resigned herself and leaned her head against Amane's arm
        <p></p>as they walked.
        <p></p>"…That perceptiveness of yours is both good and bad. I
        <p></p>can't hide anything."
        <p></p>"It's because you're bad at hiding stuff. When you're not
        <p></p>feeling well, your movements and behavior change a little
        <p></p>bit."
        <p></p>"For example?"
        <p></p>"If I tell you, you'll try to hide it, so I'm not saying."
        <p></p>Amane could tell when Mahiru was smiling, or walking, or
        <p></p>even moving her hands differently, but if he told her that,
        <p></p>she would deliberately try not to do it, so he wasn't going to
        <p></p>say anything.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked dissatisfied, but there was no way Amane
        <p></p>was going to give in, so he turned down her request and
        <p></p>rubbed her hand that he was holding. Her hand felt a little
        <p></p>colder than usual, which he figured was due to the rainy
        <p></p>weather.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"You ought to rely on me a little bit more, okay? Here,
        <p></p>let's go into that grocery store. We'll get side dishes and…
        <p></p>Well, if there's anything you want me to make, I'll make it."
        <p></p>"…Rice balls."
        <p></p>He realized she was really having a hard time when she
        <p></p>obediently answered without putting up any resistance. He
        <p></p>thought with slight remorse that he should've taken better
        <p></p>care of her.
        <p></p>But Mahiru didn't seem like she was in danger of
        <p></p>collapsing, and at school, the last thing she wanted to do was
        <p></p>seem like she was struggling. Amane was probably reading
        <p></p>too much into things, but still, he thought it was probably
        <p></p>best to stay close to her side.
        <p></p>Amane adjusted his grip on Mahiru's hand as she leaned
        <p></p>on him limply, and he smiled down at her. She had stopped
        <p></p>trying to keep up appearances and was wearing a listless
        <p></p>expression.
        <p></p>"I can make something a little more elaborate than that,
        <p></p>you know? You can ask me to make whatever you want."
        <p></p>"I'd like to have the rice balls that you make."
        <p></p>Amane had been sure she was holding back because he
        <p></p>wasn't a very good cook, but apparently Mahiru really was
        <p></p>happy with his rice balls. She looked up at him with
        <p></p>somewhat frail eyes.
        <p></p>"Is that okay?"
        <p></p>"Sure thing. If you want them, I'll make them. I'll make
        <p></p>the best ones I can!" Amane smiled playfully.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru also smiled happily. "I'm expecting them to be
        <p></p>good, okay?" She seemed to be feeling more at ease, so
        <p></p>Amane, maintaining a gentle expression, headed for the
        <p></p>supermarket with Mahiru in tow.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 59: What Changed After Starting to Date 
        <p></p>"Come to think of it, Fujimiya, I know you started dating
        <p></p>Shiina after Sports Day, but has anything else about you
        <p></p>changed?"
        <p></p>The school sports grounds were unusable due to the long
        <p></p>spell of rain, so the girls were having gym indoors while the
        <p></p>boys had health class. Just as their teacher left the
        <p></p>classroom, the student sitting in front of Amane asked him
        <p></p>that question.
        <p></p>It was just a guess, but Amane figured the inquiry was
        <p></p>prompted by their teacher's warning that since Sports Day
        <p></p>was behind them, it was time to focus on their studies. As far
        <p></p>as Amane was concerned, his attitude in class was the same
        <p></p>as ever, or maybe even more serious than before, so he
        <p></p>hadn't thought those words were directed at him. But the
        <p></p>mention of Sports Day must have unconsciously reminded
        <p></p>the other boys of him.
        <p></p>The rest of the boys must have been curious, too, because
        <p></p>they all turned to face him, which gave Amane some mixed
        <p></p>feelings.
        <p></p>"Well, I've started getting ambushed like this at school,"
        <p></p>he muttered.
        <p></p>"Sorry. But other than that? How far have you two gone?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…We've hardly done anything," Amane replied. "At most,
        <p></p>we've started walking home together and stuff."
        <p></p>About two weeks had passed since Amane and Mahiru
        <p></p>had started dating, but nothing had really changed. After all,
        <p></p>they had plenty of physical contact before making it official,
        <p></p>and Mahiru was still coming over to his apartment like
        <p></p>always.
        <p></p>If he had to name something, it would be that he had been
        <p></p>trying to make more deliberate physical contact, but as far as
        <p></p>their daily lives were concerned, things were still the same.
        <p></p>"No way!"
        <p></p>"Why would I need to lie about that?"
        <p></p>"Well, I mean, come on…"
        <p></p>"Look—"
        <p></p>"Shiina's fallen so hard for you, so, like, I thought you'd be
        <p></p>fooling around more or something."
        <p></p>"Fooling around…? Not really; stuff like that is—"
        <p></p>"Amane! You're such a prude. We can't count on you for
        <p></p>any juicy stories." Itsuki had apparently overheard the
        <p></p>conversation from nearby. "You know, any normal couple
        <p></p>would be fooling around… You two are unbelievable!" he
        <p></p>said, exasperated.
        <p></p>Amane stared daggers at his friend, but Itsuki just
        <p></p>laughed, not at all bothered.
        <p></p>"…I don't even know how to respond to that. I'm not going
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>to force us to do things just because it's what couples are
        <p></p>supposed to do. Everything's like it always was."
        <p></p>"So that means you guys have always been fooling around,
        <p></p>right?"
        <p></p>"Listen here—"
        <p></p>"I think Yamazaki's got a point," Itsuki insisted. "You
        <p></p>might think you're being careful, but it's plain for everyone
        <p></p>to see. Even when I try to stop you two, you flirt. So I figured
        <p></p>if that's you guys trying to tone it down in public, you must
        <p></p>be even more flirtatious at home."
        <p></p>Amane didn't mean to do so, but he had ended up making
        <p></p>the case that he and Mahiru had always been intimate. He
        <p></p>started to insist it wasn't how it sounded but knew the other
        <p></p>boys probably wouldn't listen anyway, no matter what he
        <p></p>said.
        <p></p>"Wait, what do you mean 'at home'…?"
        <p></p>Amane cursed silently as the boys surrounding him
        <p></p>started to make a fuss. Too late, he realized Itsuki had added
        <p></p>some unnecessary information.
        <p></p>"Shiina is usually over at Amane's place, and I bet when
        <p></p>they're alone they flirt like crazy. They're already way past
        <p></p>dating; they're practically married, man."
        <p></p>"Itsuki…"
        <p></p>"If you try to hide it, people are gonna suspect something,
        <p></p>so I'll just go ahead and say it. Some people have already
        <p></p>spotted you going back to the same apartment building, so
        <p></p>really, I'm just setting the record straight before you end up
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>with a bad reputation."
        <p></p>Itsuki gave Amane a meaningful look, then pressed his
        <p></p>lips together tightly. They both knew Mahiru would be upset
        <p></p>if she became the subject of weird rumors.
        <p></p>It would definitely be bad if people thought Mahiru was
        <p></p>spending the night already, even though they had just
        <p></p>started going out. It wouldn't make Amane happy at all if
        <p></p>people said those kinds of things about her.
        <p></p>She had stayed over before, and he had lent her his bed,
        <p></p>but not once had they ever slept in the same room together.
        <p></p>Mahiru had pleaded with him to join her once when she was
        <p></p>half asleep, but he hadn't gone through with it, so surely that
        <p></p>didn't count.
        <p></p>"Now that I think about it, you did say that you were
        <p></p>neighbors with Shiina… Did you mean she's super close by?"
        <p></p>"…Well, we live in the same building, so she's at my place
        <p></p>a lot."
        <p></p>"So that means if we go over to your place, we could go to
        <p></p>hers, too…"
        <p></p>"I won't invite you up, so you'll get turned away at the
        <p></p>entrance. If you make any suspicious moves, the security
        <p></p>guard will come and throw you out. You can count on that."
        <p></p>Of course, the apartment building where Amane and
        <p></p>Mahiru lived wasn't fancy enough to have a concierge, but it
        <p></p>did have decent security. The building was designed for
        <p></p>fairly wealthy residents, with an inner courtyard, and
        <p></p>security guards who would deal with anyone acting
        <p></p>suspiciously.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Come on, that was a joke… So in other words, Shiina
        <p></p>hangs out at your place a lot, Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"H-hangs out? Well…yeah, we spend quite a lot of time
        <p></p>together, but—"
        <p></p>Mahiru wasn't just hanging out. Aside from bathing and
        <p></p>sleeping, she spent almost all her time at Amane's
        <p></p>apartment. She was practically living there. But Amane
        <p></p>knew if he said that, it would set the boys off again, so he
        <p></p>chose not to mention it.
        <p></p>But even with just that information, the other boys drew
        <p></p>closer to him, their eyes wide. From the sound of their chairs
        <p></p>scraping one after another across the floor, it was fairly
        <p></p>shocking news.
        <p></p>"Hold up, hold up, that's not right!"
        <p></p>"It's like something from a porno game plot. The old
        <p></p>'childhood friend' trope! It's not right!"
        <p></p>"And in the meantime, you two look like you have the
        <p></p>most wholesome relationship! If anything, we're losing our
        <p></p>minds because you're such a Goody Two-shoes. The only
        <p></p>thing we could do is to tell you to make a move."
        <p></p>"Wha…? Make a move? We only just started going out;
        <p></p>there's no way."
        <p></p>They had been dating for two weeks, and Amane was not
        <p></p>in a hurry to do anything like that. And even if he did want
        <p></p>to, he was worried that Mahiru would think he was only
        <p></p>interested in sex.
        <p></p>Amane had no intention of rushing things. He would leave
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>it to Mahiru, instead of pressing the issue and trying to force
        <p></p>things to move forward. Anyway, they hadn't even kissed
        <p></p>yet, so there was no way they were going to jump straight
        <p></p>into doing more.
        <p></p>"It's better to let time pass and take it slow," Amane said.
        <p></p>"We'll do stuff like that when we're both ready. I'm not going
        <p></p>to force it on her."
        <p></p>Amane felt embarrassed to be talking about the subject
        <p></p>and ended the conversation with an anticlimactic
        <p></p>pronouncement.
        <p></p>Itsuki looked around at the other boys and shrugged
        <p></p>dramatically. "You see? This is one of those things that
        <p></p>Shiina likes about Amane. He's a toootal gentleman. He's so
        <p></p>cautious and considerate, you could almost say he's
        <p></p>impotent."
        <p></p>"Fujimiya, are you out of your mind? Are you made of
        <p></p>flesh and blood? How can you even call yourself a man?"
        <p></p>"I see how it is. You're all here to make fun of me."
        <p></p>Amane scowled, wondering how anybody could see
        <p></p>anything other than a man when they looked at him.
        <p></p>From all sides, he heard things like, "If you had a girl as
        <p></p>cute as the angel by your side, why wouldn't you pin her
        <p></p>down?" and "This is what a loser looks like," which made his
        <p></p>mouth twitch.
        <p></p>"It's none of your business, so just shut up," Amane
        <p></p>insisted. "We're taking things at our own pace, so we don't
        <p></p>need anyone butting in."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"You know, I heard that Shiina has been getting advice
        <p></p>from Chi," Itsuki mentioned.
        <p></p>"Well, you can tell Chitose to be careful about what she
        <p></p>says. Mahiru doesn't need to learn everything that Chitose
        <p></p>has to teach."
        <p></p>Even though Mahiru had a good head on her shoulders,
        <p></p>she was a beginner when it came to adult relationships, and
        <p></p>Amane was worried that Chitose might give her false
        <p></p>expectations.
        <p></p>"So you're insisting that you should be the one to instruct
        <p></p>the innocent Shiina?"
        <p></p>"Cut it out, man."
        <p></p>Amane glared critically at Itsuki, wondering why he had
        <p></p>to interpret everything that way, but Itsuki feigned
        <p></p>innocence.
        <p></p>"Now, now. Besides, even if I told Chi to stop, the other
        <p></p>girls are probably telling her all sorts of things, too. Shiina's
        <p></p>in love, she's adorable, and they're gonna give her advice."
        <p></p>"And what good does that do me, if they give her all kinds
        <p></p>of weird ideas?"
        <p></p>"You get to appreciate Shiina's charming, adorable efforts,
        <p></p>of course."
        <p></p>"Well, I guess I can't argue with that, but just try putting
        <p></p>yourself in my shoes; think of the shock my poor heart will
        <p></p>have to take."
        <p></p>"Isn't it nice that she's working so hard for you?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>When Itsuki put it that way, Amane couldn't possibly
        <p></p>refute it, so he just frowned and kept his complaints to
        <p></p>himself. Itsuki must have known how he would react
        <p></p>because he cackled with laughter.
        <p></p>"Well, I can't stop Chi from trying to help, since she's
        <p></p>decided she wants to encourage Mahiru's love for you."
        <p></p>"…It's your fault for not knowing what kind of advice your
        <p></p>girlfriend might be giving."
        <p></p>"I don't think she's telling her anything too extreme. Even
        <p></p>Chi has some tact, after all."
        <p></p>"I wonder…"
        <p></p>"Just the other day, I saw Shirakawa lecturing Shiina on
        <p></p>how to cuddle, telling her, 'Amane will be happy if you do
        <p></p>things like this,'" another boy added.
        <p></p>"Itsuki, you have a duty to control her…"
        <p></p>"Like it's my fault?!"
        <p></p>Amane looked accusingly at Itsuki and said, "So she is
        <p></p>teaching Mahiru all kinds of weird stuff?"
        <p></p>It was easy to imagine Chitose had, for better or worse,
        <p></p>been filling Mahiru's head with all sorts of information
        <p></p>about male-female relationships. The only one who could
        <p></p>keep Chitose in check was Itsuki, so Amane thought that
        <p></p>Itsuki ought to be the one to stop her.
        <p></p>Amane let out an exasperated sigh, and the boys
        <p></p>surrounding him stared at him in silence. The atmosphere
        <p></p>was indescribable.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"So this is just you boasting about your love life?" one of
        <p></p>the boys asked, summarizing what everyone wanted to say.
        <p></p>"…That wasn't my intention," Amane replied. But there
        <p></p>wasn't a single boy there who believed him.
        <p></p>"That reminds me, you guys were all riled up during gym
        <p></p>today; did something interesting happen?"
        <p></p>Classes were over for the day, and they had returned
        <p></p>home. Amane hadn't been prepared for Mahiru's sudden
        <p></p>question, and he dropped his smartphone, letting it fall to
        <p></p>his lap. It was quite heavy because of the wallet-style case, so
        <p></p>he felt a bit of pain in his thighs as he returned Mahiru's
        <p></p>gaze, and their eyes met. She was sitting beside Amane with
        <p></p>a very puzzled look.
        <p></p>She obviously knew the boys had been talking about
        <p></p>something. They had kept chatting after the period ended, so
        <p></p>she must have heard voices when she came back to the
        <p></p>classroom.
        <p></p>"Oh, well no, um, please don't worry about it."
        <p></p>Amane averted his eyes. He couldn't possibly tell her that
        <p></p>they had been asking how far he and Mahiru had gone.
        <p></p>"Huh…?" Mahiru sounded upset. "Usually when you say
        <p></p>something like that, it's exactly the sort of situation I should
        <p></p>be worried about it."
        <p></p>"It was just regular boy talk; we had some catching up to
        <p></p>do, you could say."
        <p></p>"Uh-huh… The type of conversation that you can't repeat
        <p></p>—or don't want to?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"It's not that I can't repeat it, it's just embarrassing."
        <p></p>His reply seemed likely to invite misunderstanding, but
        <p></p>Amane was ashamed to explain their conversation in detail,
        <p></p>so he settled on being vague. Mahiru stayed quiet as she
        <p></p>stared at Amane.
        <p></p>Is she fed up with me or displeased…? He felt a slight
        <p></p>twinge of pain somewhere near his stomach, but Mahiru
        <p></p>gave an uneasy smile.
        <p></p>"Ah, if you don't really want to say, that's fine; you don't
        <p></p>have to. It wouldn't be nice for me to pry; you deserve your
        <p></p>own privacy, too. I'm sure there are some things that boys
        <p></p>only talk about with other boys. Some topics that girls ought
        <p></p>not ask you about."
        <p></p>"I have mixed feelings about how understanding you are,
        <p></p>but… Well, it's nothing that serious. Would it be okay to not
        <p></p>talk about it?"
        <p></p>"I mean, you would never ask me what I talk about with
        <p></p>other girls, right?"
        <p></p>"I guess not. If I went about it poorly, I would probably
        <p></p>offend you, though I wouldn't ask anything you didn't want
        <p></p>to answer. Even if you're my girlfriend, that doesn't mean
        <p></p>it's okay to tell you how to lead your life, you know?"
        <p></p>Amane was smart enough to know that girls had all sorts
        <p></p>of secret conversations among themselves. Even though he
        <p></p>was curious about what Mahiru might have discussed, he
        <p></p>was also afraid of the answer, so he didn't really want to ask.
        <p></p>Still, he figured there were probably people who would have
        <p></p>liked to pry.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru was her own person with her own life, so Amane
        <p></p>intended to respect her privacy, even if she was his
        <p></p>girlfriend.
        <p></p>That's the difference between them and me.
        <p></p>This time, Amane looked directly at Mahiru, and she
        <p></p>smiled softly, looking amused.
        <p></p>"I feel the same way," she said. "I don't think it's right for
        <p></p>me to try to know everything about you just because I like
        <p></p>you. Even if there are things I don't know, that doesn't
        <p></p>change how I feel about you, Amane."
        <p></p>"…That's one of the charming things about you, you
        <p></p>know."
        <p></p>"Right back at you."
        <p></p>Mahiru giggled in her elegant voice and leaned against his
        <p></p>arm. Amane felt self-conscious because he could sense her
        <p></p>trust in him. Tracing the pad of his finger lightly over the
        <p></p>smooth back of her hand, he whispered, "Is it really all right
        <p></p>if I don't tell you?"
        <p></p>His conversation with the other boys wasn't something he
        <p></p>particularly wanted to share, but neither was it something he
        <p></p>felt like he had to hide. He was prepared to tell her if not
        <p></p>knowing made her anxious, but Mahiru smiled, still leaning
        <p></p>against him.
        <p></p>"If you want to tell me, I'll listen, but if it's something
        <p></p>you'd rather not share, then I won't ask."
        <p></p>She left it up to him to do as he pleased, and Amane
        <p></p>pondered over what to do for a full ten seconds before slowly
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>opening his mouth to speak.
        <p></p>"…Well, um, how do I put it? The guys were asking me
        <p></p>how things have changed since we started going out, and
        <p></p>they asked me how far we've gone, and other typical
        <p></p>questions like that."
        <p></p>The other boys probably already had their suspicions, but
        <p></p>they hadn't said them out loud, so Amane hadn't responded
        <p></p>to them. But they had also expressed interest in how things
        <p></p>had changed for him, so he had decided to make that the
        <p></p>main point when telling Mahiru.
        <p></p>Amane spoke hesitantly, but Mahiru seemed to
        <p></p>understand. "I guess they were curious about it, huh?" She
        <p></p>smiled wryly. "But things that have changed since we started
        <p></p>dating… I guess my awareness of you has. Like, I touch you a
        <p></p>lot on purpose now, but that's it."
        <p></p>"That's because we were already close to begin with.
        <p></p>Rather than saying we've changed, I feel like our
        <p></p>surroundings have instead."
        <p></p>The two of them had only realized it upon later reflection,
        <p></p>but they had been touching each other in moderation before
        <p></p>they even started dating. They held hands when Amane was
        <p></p>escorting her to places, embraced when consoling each
        <p></p>other, and once, Mahiru had kissed his cheek for revenge.
        <p></p>They'd been so touchy that it was strange they hadn't
        <p></p>become a couple sooner.
        <p></p>It was extremely embarrassing to think about, and Amane
        <p></p>wondered why he hadn't been able to return her affection at
        <p></p>the time. He had been cautious—no, cowardly—so he
        <p></p>couldn't work up the determination.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Of course, he was ashamed of how pathetic he'd been, so
        <p></p>moving forward, he wanted to be able to take the lead with
        <p></p>Mahiru, and he intended to put in the effort so he would be
        <p></p>able to do so confidently.
        <p></p>"You're right about that. And you've totally fixed your
        <p></p>appearance, which changed how people see you. It's gotten
        <p></p>easier for everyone, even girls, to talk to you."
        <p></p>"No, the only time girls speak to me is to cheer me on,
        <p></p>so…"
        <p></p>"But I've been hearing people say you look cool, too, you
        <p></p>know? And that your smile is cute."
        <p></p>"That smile was probably directed at you, though… You're
        <p></p>the only one I see," Amane whispered quietly to calm her.
        <p></p>He couldn't help imagining that she was feeling a little
        <p></p>jealous.
        <p></p>Even as her cheeks flushed slightly, she pressed her head
        <p></p>against him and didn't seem at all dissatisfied.
        <p></p>Amane thought about how cherubic and cute she looked
        <p></p>when she did that, but he knew that if he said it out loud, she
        <p></p>would scold him to not treat her like a child, so he kept it to
        <p></p>himself and smiled quietly.
        <p></p>As Amane gazed lovingly at Mahiru, who seemed to be in
        <p></p>a good mood, he recalled what had happened when he was
        <p></p>surrounded by his classmates and remembered there was
        <p></p>something he needed to ask her.
        <p></p>"Anyway, I did hear one thing that I want to ask about."
        <p></p>"Oh?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Mahiru, it seems you've been getting advice from Chitose
        <p></p>and some of the other girls. They're not telling you anything
        <p></p>weird, right?"
        <p></p>He stared at Mahiru with the unspoken additional
        <p></p>question of And you're not telling them any details about
        <p></p>our relationship, right? Mahiru looked up awkwardly at
        <p></p>Amane and then suddenly averted her gaze.
        <p></p>"…Only a little bit—"
        <p></p>"They are, aren't they? Well… I won't tell you not to talk to
        <p></p>them, but please try not to expose too much of our personal
        <p></p>lives. It'll be super embarrassing if rumors start circulating."
        <p></p>"I-I'll be careful."
        <p></p>Consulting with her friends wasn't an issue, but Amane
        <p></p>didn't want Mahiru to share too much about their
        <p></p>relationship. Of course, he trusted Mahiru to exercise good
        <p></p>judgment, but she could also be a little careless sometimes,
        <p></p>so Amane figured it would be best to warn her, just in case.
        <p></p>Mahiru shrank back into her seat, perhaps thinking that
        <p></p>she had already overshared, even if they were her friends.
        <p></p>Not that Amane hadn't also consulted with Itsuki and
        <p></p>Yuuta, but he had always chosen his topics carefully and had
        <p></p>never asked them anything particularly deep. He was
        <p></p>starting to suspect that maybe Mahiru had some major
        <p></p>complaint or insecurity about their relationship.
        <p></p>"…Are you really that anxious about dating me?" he asked.
        <p></p>"A-anxious? It's not like that… Um, I j-just asked them
        <p></p>how I could make you happy."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"But I'm perfectly happy just being with you…"
        <p></p>"Yes, of course… You're the type who says it's more than
        <p></p>enough just to be with me. You don't desire much, and you
        <p></p>rarely make requests of people, isn't that right?"
        <p></p>"I feel like I could say the same about you."
        <p></p>All of what she'd said also applied to Mahiru herself, but
        <p></p>after blinking several times, hiding her caramel-colored eyes
        <p></p>for a moment each time they closed, she smiled at him
        <p></p>coquettishly.
        <p></p>"…I can be quite greedy, you know? I want to have you all
        <p></p>to myself; I want to pamper you and be pampered."
        <p></p>"Right back at you, as you would say."
        <p></p>"You want to be spoiled?"
        <p></p>"…W-well, I like you, so yes, and I want to do the same for
        <p></p>you, too. As for keeping you all to myself, well, I'll try to only
        <p></p>do that when we're at home."
        <p></p>Mahiru probably didn't think so, but Amane had always
        <p></p>considered himself to be the more possessive one.
        <p></p>He knew, of course, that Mahiru had her own feelings and
        <p></p>her own life—and that she should be able to live however she
        <p></p>wanted. Amane did want to respect that, but…be that as it
        <p></p>may, she was his girlfriend, and he often caught himself
        <p></p>wishing he didn't have to share her with anyone else.
        <p></p>He knew Mahiru was popular, and he could accept that
        <p></p>for what it was, but he still wanted to pull his cute girlfriend
        <p></p>into his arms and keep her for himself. He wished she would
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>show her sweet side only to him and that she wouldn't be
        <p></p>affectionate with anybody else. That was how deeply Amane
        <p></p>loved Mahiru.
        <p></p>Man, that's heavy, even for me…, he chided himself. But
        <p></p>for some reason, Mahiru smiled pleasantly, looking tickled.
        <p></p>"…I found one thing that has changed about you since we
        <p></p>started dating, Amane."
        <p></p>"What?"
        <p></p>"You're more honest about expressing your emotions now
        <p></p>—and showing love."
        <p></p>Far from balking at Amane's heavy feelings, Mahiru
        <p></p>looked up at him bashfully and leaned in close, happy to
        <p></p>accept him.
        <p></p>Amane also thought that he had become more honest,
        <p></p>compared to before they were dating. He had pined after
        <p></p>Mahiru for so long, and he wanted to treasure her and never
        <p></p>upset her with his words. Thus he'd naturally become
        <p></p>gentler, as he tried his best to express his love so that
        <p></p>Mahiru would never feel disheartened.
        <p></p>"Well, I figure that nice words aren't enough. If I don't
        <p></p>show you properly how much I love you, you'll sour on me, I
        <p></p>hear."
        <p></p>"That's just like you, Amane."
        <p></p>"Is it something you're unhappy with?"
        <p></p>"No, it's a good point, of course, but just… Sometimes it's
        <p></p>bad for my heart, you could say."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane felt a surge of love for Mahiru, who had her cheeks
        <p></p>puffed out slightly as if he was being unfair, and he patted
        <p></p>her head.
        <p></p>"I don't want to hear that from you; you're just as bad."
        <p></p>"And what would you say I've done?"
        <p></p>"Everything about you is adorable, and you leave yourself
        <p></p>so defenseless. It's tough to bear."
        <p></p>"…You really are bad for my heart," Mahiru said, slapping
        <p></p>Amane's arm playfully.
        <p></p>Naturally, he couldn't do the same thing back to her, so he
        <p></p>tapped the pad of his finger against her cheek in a tickling
        <p></p>way as revenge.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 60: Nothing Too Sexy 
        <p></p>"Amane, I've got someplace to go today, so is it all right if
        <p></p>we head home separately?" Mahiru asked. It was early July,
        <p></p>and they'd just been about to leave school together, as
        <p></p>always.
        <p></p>It was an unexpected request coming from Mahiru, who
        <p></p>always wanted to walk home with Amane, and he caught
        <p></p>himself staring at her without meaning to.
        <p></p>As a rule, Amane accompanied her whenever she had to
        <p></p>make a side trip, so the fact that she was gently stopping him
        <p></p>from doing so meant it was probably something she didn't
        <p></p>want him to know about.
        <p></p>But he could tell from Mahiru's expression that it wasn't
        <p></p>anything she felt particularly guilty over, so he wasn't
        <p></p>worried about it.
        <p></p>The sun set later in the summer, so it should be fine as
        <p></p>long as her errand didn't take a long time. Though if he was
        <p></p>to state his true feelings, he would have liked to go home
        <p></p>together.
        <p></p>"Mm, got it. I'll see you later, then."
        <p></p>He knew that either way he was going to have plenty of
        <p></p>time to spend with her at home, so he respected Mahiru's
        <p></p>wishes.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>She looked relieved by his answer but then opened her
        <p></p>eyes a little bit wider, as if she had suddenly realized
        <p></p>something, and gave him a look like she was raising her
        <p></p>guard just a little.
        <p></p>"…Don't walk home with any other girls, okay?"
        <p></p>"Do you think I would do that?"
        <p></p>"You wouldn't, but there's a possibility that you'll be
        <p></p>asked, you see. That's… Well, I'm not saying they can't, but I
        <p></p>don't like it. Other girls have been talking to you lately,
        <p></p>and…"
        <p></p>It was a miracle Amane didn't react out loud.
        <p></p>…Don't tell me…she's jealous?
        <p></p>It should have been obvious from the way he acted toward
        <p></p>Mahiru that Amane hadn't been asked by other girls, but
        <p></p>apparently, Mahiru had started worrying about it.
        <p></p>Actually, the only girls who had spoken to him had done
        <p></p>so to show their support for his relationship and wish him
        <p></p>good luck, so there was no need for concern.
        <p></p>Even though he still felt slightly uncomfortable, Mahiru
        <p></p>was looking up at him with an imploring, anxious
        <p></p>expression. He wanted to stroke her hair because of how
        <p></p>cute she was, but there were eyes all around them, so he
        <p></p>restrained himself.
        <p></p>He had messed up once before and everyone had huddled
        <p></p>around to see Mahiru's smiling face, so naturally he wasn't
        <p></p>about to repeat that mistake.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"It's all right. I only have eyes for you, and I haven't told
        <p></p>anyone I'll walk home with them. Unless you count being
        <p></p>dragged around by Chitose."
        <p></p>"…That's good to hear."
        <p></p>If it was Chitose, it seemed like it would be okay. But to
        <p></p>begin with, she had Itsuki, so she was definitely not
        <p></p>interested in Amane. And he had also never looked at
        <p></p>Chitose that way, so Mahiru probably felt at ease.
        <p></p>Mahiru relaxed her shoulders, seemingly relieved by
        <p></p>Amane's words, and this time, she gazed up at him with a
        <p></p>hint of embarrassment.
        <p></p>"Also, um, just because I don't want there to be any
        <p></p>chance of a misunderstanding, I'll tell you where we're
        <p></p>going."
        <p></p>"You don't need to keep it a secret?"
        <p></p>"N-no."
        <p></p>He got the sense that she was fairly hesitant to say it, but
        <p></p>he waited patiently for her to continue.
        <p></p>"W-well…we're…going shopping."
        <p></p>"Gotcha. That doesn't really seem like anything to be
        <p></p>embarrassed about."
        <p></p>"I'm going with Chitose…u-um—to buy a swimsuit, so—"
        <p></p>"…A swimsuit?"
        <p></p>Sure enough, it was July, and they were being sold in all
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>the stores now.
        <p></p>In the shopping mall that they frequently visited, a special
        <p></p>shop had opened just for selling swimsuits, and Amane had
        <p></p>fresh memories of girls from their class talking about going
        <p></p>to buy some.
        <p></p>But he had never thought Mahiru would.
        <p></p>After all, Mahiru couldn't swim.
        <p></p>That was what she'd said, and she had even chosen a
        <p></p>school where swimming wasn't a compulsory subject, so it
        <p></p>had to be true.
        <p></p>But Mahiru wanted a bathing suit.
        <p></p>"…Weren't we going to go to the pool together…?" she
        <p></p>whispered as she drew her body near shyly.
        <p></p>In response to her words, Amane stiffened, then he
        <p></p>covered his face with his hand.
        <p></p>…I wish you wouldn't make that kind of face when you
        <p></p>say it…
        <p></p>Sure enough, the other students in the classroom were
        <p></p>looking their way.
        <p></p>From looks of confusion to tepid smiles, a variety of
        <p></p>expressions were directed at them, and Amane felt unsettled
        <p></p>by a mixture of discomfort and embarrassment. Even under
        <p></p>normal circumstances, he had trouble keeping it together
        <p></p>when he saw Mahiru looking bashful, and in this
        <p></p>atmosphere, with people watching, he could hardly stand
        <p></p>being there.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…I see. Um… Enjoy your shopping."
        <p></p>"Th-thanks… What kind should I get?"
        <p></p>"Nothing too suggestive," he answered immediately.
        <p></p>Anything that fit Mahiru's style, even a swimsuit, was sure
        <p></p>to be suitable, but Amane would have preferred that it didn't
        <p></p>expose any more than necessary.
        <p></p>After all, it had only been several weeks since they had
        <p></p>started dating, and for the most part, he hadn't seen much of
        <p></p>her bare skin.
        <p></p>At school, she buttoned her shirts all the way up and
        <p></p>always wore tights. She dressed so modestly that he
        <p></p>sometimes worried she might overheat.
        <p></p>At home, she never wore clothes that exposed her chest,
        <p></p>and she wore a lot of long skirts. Whenever she wore shorts,
        <p></p>she also had on tights underneath.
        <p></p>In other words, Amane had never seen much of Mahiru's
        <p></p>body. He'd never even had the chance to.
        <p></p>Under those circumstances, if she chose a sexy swimsuit,
        <p></p>Amane would probably wind up curled into a ball on the
        <p></p>floor for a while.
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes went wide, and she blinked in surprise at
        <p></p>Amane's definitive answer, then she snorted quietly.
        <p></p>"That's a very Amane answer."
        <p></p>"I would die. So pick one that's not too flashy."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, what to do…?"
        <p></p>"Mahiru—"
        <p></p>"I'll consult with Chitose about what will make you
        <p></p>happy."
        <p></p>Mahiru still looked a little shy, and Amane pressed his lips
        <p></p>together tightly.
        <p></p>I'd better send Chitose a message telling her not to
        <p></p>recommend anything weird.
        <p></p>It was a matter of life or death. He had to stop her, to save
        <p></p>himself.
        <p></p>Amane made up his mind to send a message to Chitose,
        <p></p>who was currently not in the classroom, and poked Mahiru
        <p></p>in the cheek. She looked like she was thinking of something
        <p></p>mischievous.
        <p></p>At the end of the day, Mahiru refused to tell him what
        <p></p>kind of swimsuit she had purchased. She dodged the
        <p></p>question with an impish answer, saying "You can look
        <p></p>forward to when I put it on."
        <p></p>He had gone ahead and warned Chitose, but it was
        <p></p>doubtful whether she had listened. If anything, from the way
        <p></p>she had gleefully told Mahiru that she thought her choice
        <p></p>would make him happy, he was sure she had recommended
        <p></p>something that showed a lot of skin.
        <p></p>"I'm begging you, not something too flashy," Amane's
        <p></p>grumbling echoed in the otherwise empty bathroom.
        <p></p>He had gotten into the bathtub to wash his sweat off,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>leaving the post-meal cleanup to Mahiru after she
        <p></p>volunteered to do it, but he couldn't help worrying about the
        <p></p>swimsuit.
        <p></p>Amane was a high school boy, so of course he had
        <p></p>fantasized about what kind of swimsuit his girlfriend might
        <p></p>wear.
        <p></p>Something that generously exposed her slender body
        <p></p>would certainly be attractive. Mahiru had always had a curvy
        <p></p>figure, so if she wore a bikini or something, he was certain
        <p></p>he wouldn't be able to gaze directly at her.
        <p></p>His heart was pounding just imagining it, and his body
        <p></p>was burning up. Part of that was because he was soaking in
        <p></p>the tub, but he was hot for another reason, too.
        <p></p>…I'm sure anything would look good on her, but I would
        <p></p>have a hard time looking at her or even standing next to
        <p></p>her.
        <p></p>Amane thought he had a right to see—and a right to stand
        <p></p>by her side. But next to her, he would be practically invisible.
        <p></p>He glanced quickly down at his own body, but it was still a
        <p></p>far cry from perfect. He had never had much meat on his
        <p></p>bones to begin with, so he was already starting to see the
        <p></p>bumps of his abdominal muscles, but he had yet to reach his
        <p></p>ideal body type. Most people would have considered him
        <p></p>kind of scrawny.
        <p></p>No matter how he thought about it, he didn't feel like a
        <p></p>particularly strong or stylish kind of guy.
        <p></p>He wished his physique was a little more solidly built, but
        <p></p>he had always assumed that since both of his parents were
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>slim, his body type was probably hereditary, so there was
        <p></p>nothing he could do. To make up for it, he was tall, so he felt
        <p></p>very grateful to his parents for that at least.
        <p></p>"…I should consult with Kadowaki and increase my
        <p></p>strength training a little more."
        <p></p>He had already established a good foundation, and
        <p></p>recently, he'd been lifting even heavier weights. If he worked
        <p></p>a little harder, while being sure not to overdo it, then he'd
        <p></p>definitely be able to improve his physique before debuting
        <p></p>his bathing suit body.
        <p></p>He was determined to stand by Mahiru's side, so he
        <p></p>couldn't slack off and would need to try even harder so he
        <p></p>could have confidence in himself.
        <p></p>Amane sighed softly and dipped his face halfway into the
        <p></p>bathwater.
        <p></p>He had worked himself up imagining Mahiru in her
        <p></p>swimsuit and himself next to her. Now he was too hot.
        <p></p>Normally, when he soaked in the bathtub, he would be in
        <p></p>there for about ten minutes, so his anguish was obvious
        <p></p>when it took him over half an hour before he got out.
        <p></p>Since he had spent more than three times the usual
        <p></p>amount in the bath, it was about ten thirty. He confirmed
        <p></p>the time by checking the waterproof clock that he kept in the
        <p></p>bathroom. Mahiru typically went back to her own apartment
        <p></p>at ten o'clock, so she should have already left.
        <p></p>With that presumption, Amane wiped away the water
        <p></p>dripping off his body and immediately got dressed. He was
        <p></p>very warm from having soaked for too long, so he decided to
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>let the air conditioner cool him off and didn't put on a shirt.
        <p></p>Wearing only a pair of sweatpants, with a towel over his
        <p></p>head, Amane imagined his parents scolding him for looking
        <p></p>so sloppy as he left the bathroom and returned to the living
        <p></p>room.
        <p></p>Wondering if there were any good shows on television,
        <p></p>Amane walked in with his eyes on the screen. But as soon as
        <p></p>he got there, he saw a familiar curtain of flaxen hair hanging
        <p></p>down the back of the sofa.
        <p></p>She hasn't gone home yet?
        <p></p>Normally Mahiru wouldn't have been there, but oddly
        <p></p>enough, she had stayed.
        <p></p>She was looking down a little bit, moving her arm while
        <p></p>staring at something in her hands. She was probably tending
        <p></p>to some schoolwork that she would usually have done at
        <p></p>home. Amane approached her with interest, marveling that
        <p></p>she was, as ever, the hard worker.
        <p></p>"It's unusual for you to be here so late."
        <p></p>Mahiru must have been concentrating, because when
        <p></p>Amane spoke to her as he picked up the remote control from
        <p></p>the coffee table and changed the channel, she finally noticed
        <p></p>his presence, lifted her face, and froze.
        <p></p>"Yes, uh, ah…"
        <p></p>"What is it?"
        <p></p>"Uh, why—why aren't you wearing anything on top…?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>It was how he typically looked after getting out of the bath
        <p></p>during the summer, so nothing seemed particularly off to
        <p></p>Amane, but Mahiru was clearly flustered and covered her
        <p></p>face with her hands.
        <p></p>He could see her skin flushed red in between her fingers.
        <p></p>"What do you mean, why? I'm hot."
        <p></p>"P-please don't come out like that while I'm here."
        <p></p>"I mean, I figured you had gone home… It's already ten
        <p></p>thirty."
        <p></p>"I wanted to say goodnight before I left."
        <p></p>So that's why she's still here.
        <p></p>Amane sat down beside Mahiru. As he did, her shoulders
        <p></p>flinched in surprise, which made him laugh.
        <p></p>"…Are you really that embarrassed?"
        <p></p>"Of course I'm embarrassed!"
        <p></p>"But if you bought a swimsuit, you must have been
        <p></p>planning to see me in mine, too, right? But I can't be in the
        <p></p>living room like this?"
        <p></p>"Uh…"
        <p></p>Mahiru had said she was going to buy a bathing suit
        <p></p>because she planned to go swimming with him.
        <p></p>In that case, surely the thought had crossed her mind that
        <p></p>Amane would be in his, too. It was only natural if they were
        <p></p>going together.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>In other words, she must have assumed she would see
        <p></p>him half naked.
        <p></p>Yet she was getting so flustered at the sight of his bare
        <p></p>torso. It made him wonder whether they would actually be
        <p></p>able to go to the pool. If looking at his body shook her up
        <p></p>this much, he wondered how she would react to seeing other
        <p></p>boys in their swimsuits.
        <p></p>It wasn't the first time—she was embarrassed to see his
        <p></p>chest before they were together and seemed opposed to
        <p></p>seeing boys' skin at all. He was unsure whether they would
        <p></p>be able to go to the pool or the ocean.
        <p></p>"…It's nice that you bought a swimsuit, but I think it's
        <p></p>possible that you might not be able to go to the pool."
        <p></p>"Th-that's probably true, but—"
        <p></p>"In that case, how about getting used to it now, ahead of
        <p></p>time?"
        <p></p>At the moment, he was less exposed than he would be in
        <p></p>his swimsuit, so it was a chance for her to grow accustomed
        <p></p>to seeing him like this, but Mahiru shook her head
        <p></p>vigorously.
        <p></p>"I—I can't. I can't look at you as you are now."
        <p></p>"Why not?"
        <p></p>"…B-because you're…like, really sexy."
        <p></p>"Sexy?"
        <p></p>"You just got out of the bath; I really can't."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Apparently, the reason why she hadn't made eye contact
        <p></p>with him since he entered the room wasn't just because she
        <p></p>could see his skin. Despite what she'd said, Amane didn't
        <p></p>believe he was particularly attractive, but it was obvious that
        <p></p>Mahiru thought differently.
        <p></p>Amane did think that Mahiru was even more alluring
        <p></p>when she'd just gotten out of the bath, and he figured that
        <p></p>anyone probably found the person they liked even more
        <p></p>appealing in such a state.
        <p></p>As the one who was usually getting flustered by Mahiru,
        <p></p>seeing her react to him like that made Amane feel kind of
        <p></p>good, in a sadistic sort of way, but he knew that if he teased
        <p></p>her too much, Mahiru would probably get upset.
        <p></p>"If you hate it that much, I'll go put on clothes, okay?"
        <p></p>"I—I don't hate it or anything, but…w-wait a second, I'll
        <p></p>do my best."
        <p></p>"No, if it's really an issue, I'll get dressed."
        <p></p>"I-if I don't get used to it, I'll be in more trouble! Since I'm
        <p></p>going with you to the p-p-pool."
        <p></p>Mahiru spoke very bravely and glanced over at him, her
        <p></p>face red and her gaze wandering unsteadily over to other
        <p></p>spots around the room. Amane watched her struggle without
        <p></p>rushing her.
        <p></p>He couldn't exactly complain, since if he were in Mahiru's
        <p></p>position, he would definitely be letting his eyes wander,
        <p></p>probably even more than she was. It likely wouldn't just be
        <p></p>his gaze, either—his whole body would probably try to make
        <p></p>a run for it.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…I know you've been putting in a lot of work, Amane,
        <p></p>and as someone who's been rooting for you, I'm happy to see
        <p></p>that you're getting results."
        <p></p>"Mm-hmm."
        <p></p>"B-but…u-um…recently you look too good; I can't take it.
        <p></p>Ever since you found your confidence, you're too goodlooking, and it's not fair!"
        <p></p>"Not fair…?"
        <p></p>"I'm the one whose heart is pounding all the time!"
        <p></p>"…I can't just let that one go."
        <p></p>Amane knew that Mahiru's heart beat fast for him, but
        <p></p>she couldn't possibly think that his heart wasn't pounding,
        <p></p>too. Just like her, his heart was thumping harder than usual.
        <p></p>On top of that, Amane was sitting by Mahiru's side
        <p></p>burdened with other troubles that she probably didn't have.
        <p></p>From his perspective, she was the one who wasn't playing
        <p></p>fair.
        <p></p>He decided to make her realize a little bit of what he was
        <p></p>feeling, so he extended a hand out toward Mahiru's back and
        <p></p>pulled her dainty body toward him.
        <p></p>She must have been unprepared because she wasn't
        <p></p>looking at him, and she easily fell into Amane's arms, her
        <p></p>cheek coming to rest against his bare chest.
        <p></p>Her small frame was trembling noticeably.
        <p></p>"Aaamane—"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…You can yell at me for sexual harassment, or you can
        <p></p>run away if you like, but I want you to understand just a
        <p></p>little of what I'm feeling."
        <p></p>Embracing a girl while half naked was something that
        <p></p>Amane would normally never do. He hadn't intentionally
        <p></p>undressed in front of Mahiru after all, but in the moment,
        <p></p>there was no helping it.
        <p></p>"My heart is beating out of my chest… As a guy, I've got a
        <p></p>lot more to worry about in this kind of situation."
        <p></p>Of course, Amane was the reason why they were in this
        <p></p>situation, so he wasn't trying to put any of the blame on
        <p></p>Mahiru. But being alone together with his girlfriend at night,
        <p></p>he felt like he couldn't settle down no matter what. It was
        <p></p>absurd to think that Mahiru was the only one whose heart
        <p></p>was pounding.
        <p></p>In his arms, Mahiru had her cheek against Amane's chest
        <p></p>and seemed to be listening to his heartbeat, blinking
        <p></p>repeatedly in surprise with a bright-red face.
        <p></p>He seemed to have gotten his point across, so he took his
        <p></p>hands off of Mahiru, but she kept leaning against him and
        <p></p>didn't try to move.
        <p></p>"…I'm sorry; that was rude."
        <p></p>"N-not really… U-um…Amane, when you do stuff like
        <p></p>that, it's really…i-it's so manly."
        <p></p>"As opposed to…?"
        <p></p>Amane furrowed his eyebrow as he wondered whether he
        <p></p>had just been insulted, but when he saw the panic in
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes and felt her trembling, he loosened up his
        <p></p>expression.
        <p></p>"I-it's not that I didn't think you were a man. It's just,
        <p></p>um…when I'm pressed directly up against you like this…it
        <p></p>really makes me aware of it."
        <p></p>She answered him honestly, even though it seemed like it
        <p></p>was a little bit difficult for her to say. Though hesitant, she
        <p></p>touched Amane's chest with her hand. Slowly, she caressed
        <p></p>him like a fragile object, and at first, Amane felt ticklish until
        <p></p>the embarrassment set in.
        <p></p>"…Amane, you're so slim…"
        <p></p>"Sorry for being skinny. I must seem weak."
        <p></p>"That's not true at all. Just—y-you're more solid than I
        <p></p>thought. You're sturdy; I was surprised…"
        <p></p>With the tip of her finger, she slowly traced over the
        <p></p>center of his torso.
        <p></p>He wasn't really building much muscle, but the results of
        <p></p>his training were apparent, and his midsection had firmed
        <p></p>up somewhat. Mahiru gently traced her finger over his
        <p></p>abdominal muscles like they might break, though they
        <p></p>wouldn't, checking the feel of them.
        <p></p>Even though he was doing this for her, so she could get
        <p></p>used to his bare skin, he was struck with a jumble of extreme
        <p></p>uneasiness, frustration, and shame—and he found himself
        <p></p>struggling desperately to restrain a groan.
        <p></p>"I've…never touched a guy's body before, so this is new to
        <p></p>me—and surprising…"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…You're allowed to at any time you like, but if you touch
        <p></p>me too much, you'll have to deal with the consequences."
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes were perfectly clear as she blinked up at
        <p></p>Amane, though he could see a hint of shyness. Amane's
        <p></p>heart ached with a subtle suspicion that he might be the only
        <p></p>one feeling guilty about this.
        <p></p>However, the way she was stroking his skin, tracing over
        <p></p>it with her finger as if to get the feel of it, was driving him
        <p></p>nuts, so naturally he wanted to stop her. But he didn't want
        <p></p>to make her uncomfortable.
        <p></p>"I'm going to have to touch all the same spots that you
        <p></p>are."
        <p></p>Teasingly, he gently ran his hand across Mahiru's waist,
        <p></p>and she let out a feeble shriek and jumped in surprise.
        <p></p>Mahiru had always been ticklish and would start trembling
        <p></p>at the slightest touch, so he had touched her very lightly, but
        <p></p>she had reacted super sensitively.
        <p></p>He had only brushed his hand against her once and then
        <p></p>stopped, intending to withdraw and apologize immediately if
        <p></p>she seemed upset. But rather than displeasure, Mahiru
        <p></p>lowered her eyes in seeming embarrassment and pressed her
        <p></p>forehead against Amane's chest.
        <p></p>"I—I like it when you touch me, Amane, so go ahead, but…
        <p></p>j-just d-don't tickle me, okay?"
        <p></p>Mahiru looked up at him, still leaning close against him,
        <p></p>seemingly completely unaware of her own weaponized
        <p></p>charm.
        <p></p>Her words, her expression, her gaze, her posture, her
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>sweet scent carved away powerfully at Amane's sense of
        <p></p>reason. If he received one more push, the stronghold of his
        <p></p>judgment would simply crumble away.
        <p></p>For the moment, he bit his lip, and the pain barely kept
        <p></p>him in check. Then he peered into Mahiru's eyes. He could
        <p></p>see his own reflection in them, which held no doubt or
        <p></p>suspicion.
        <p></p>"…I can touch you?"
        <p></p>"Wh-why, is there a reason why you shouldn't? I'm sure I
        <p></p>asked you before to please touch me. And I think you have a
        <p></p>right to touch the same parts on me that I did on you. Wwe're a couple, so it's fine, right…?"
        <p></p>"N-no, well, I may just be a bad guy, but I think this
        <p></p>situation we're in is unwise… Do you understand?"
        <p></p>If they took one more step forward, they would never be
        <p></p>able to go back. He asked to be sure, since he had a feeling
        <p></p>Mahiru hadn't yet realized that, and after dramatically
        <p></p>blinking her caramel-colored eyes, Mahiru's face instantly
        <p></p>went up in flames like an on-demand water heater.
        <p></p>After opening and closing her mouth like she was trying to
        <p></p>say something but finding herself unable to string any words
        <p></p>together, Mahiru drew her legs up and hung her head. She
        <p></p>didn't seem like she was going to run away. But she did
        <p></p>appear to be ashamed or embarrassed and was bright red all
        <p></p>the way to her ears that were peeking out from beneath her
        <p></p>hair.
        <p></p>"Uh, ah, um… A-actually, maybe another day would be
        <p></p>better…," Mahiru managed to mutter in a hoarse, trembling
        <p></p>voice.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane looked away from her and nodded. "…That's what
        <p></p>I'd like, too… N-not that you can't touch me, but…it seems
        <p></p>like we're moving really fast, and I'm kind of scared of what
        <p></p>might happen."
        <p></p>Amane was determined to treasure their relationship and
        <p></p>to really value the time and experiences that they built up
        <p></p>together. He didn't think it would be good to skip over so
        <p></p>many steps and give in to their teenage instincts. That kind
        <p></p>of self-control was difficult for a high school boy like Amane,
        <p></p>and he worried that if she let down her guard, he would
        <p></p>likely carry her off to the bedroom. He didn't want to risk
        <p></p>losing Mahiru over something like that and resolved to resist
        <p></p>the temptation.
        <p></p>Mahiru's body coiled up again as she listened to Amane
        <p></p>squeeze out an explanation. She looked over at him, and he
        <p></p>gently stroked her hair, enduring shame that he couldn't
        <p></p>hide.
        <p></p>"I'm begging you… I want to treasure you, so please, let's
        <p></p>take it slow," he mumbled quietly.
        <p></p>"I-I'll keep that in mind…," Mahiru answered bashfully in
        <p></p>a defeated voice.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 61: Don’t Feed the Animals 
        <p></p>It had been one month since they started dating.
        <p></p>Amane, who hadn't even kissed anyone before, still wasn't
        <p></p>sure how he was supposed to touch Mahiru.
        <p></p>They'd held hands and hugged each other but hadn't
        <p></p>taken it any further than that.
        <p></p>Even though they had embraced the other day while he
        <p></p>was shirtless, nothing else had happened. Amane was sure
        <p></p>that if Itsuki somehow heard the story, he would be
        <p></p>subjected to plenty of teasing. Of course, Amane didn't agree
        <p></p>with Itsuki's judgment on the matter, but he also understood
        <p></p>why his friend might point out that it wasn't very manly.
        <p></p>Amane wanted to take their relationship to the next level,
        <p></p>but he was also afraid of moving forward. If she rejected his
        <p></p>advances, or if he hurt her and made her cry, Amane was
        <p></p>certain he would never recover from it. And he was terribly
        <p></p>worried that she would think he was a loser.
        <p></p>He glanced over at Mahiru, who was sitting beside him.
        <p></p>The day after she said it was all right to touch her, she was
        <p></p>fidgety and restless. However, several days had passed since
        <p></p>her remark, and perhaps she understood that Amane wasn't
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>going to try anything, because she had gradually returned to
        <p></p>her usual demeanor.
        <p></p>Even Amane thought it was weird that he was feeling
        <p></p>more awkward than her, but in the end, he couldn't help
        <p></p>being nervous.
        <p></p>"…Is something the matter?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had apparently noticed his gaze, and she looked
        <p></p>confused. She didn't seem to have noticed his internal
        <p></p>conflict.
        <p></p>"N-no, I was just… Well, I don't know how I'm supposed
        <p></p>to touch you, Mahiru."
        <p></p>He added quietly that he wanted to, but not carelessly, a
        <p></p>statement that sounded weak as soon as he said it.
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes widened as she recalled again what had
        <p></p>happened the other day, and her gaze shifted nervously.
        <p></p>Apparently she hadn't been thinking about it at all. Her
        <p></p>reaction made Amane laugh.
        <p></p>"So what do you want me to do?"
        <p></p>"…Is that something you should ask me?"
        <p></p>"W-well, you're the one getting touched, right? I don't
        <p></p>want to do anything you don't want, and I'd like to be as
        <p></p>gentle as possible toward you."
        <p></p>He'd prefer to avoid rushing ahead and acting on his own
        <p></p>feelings, because he knew that his conscience would never
        <p></p>let him rest if he made Mahiru uncomfortable. His parents
        <p></p>would certainly reprimand him if they ever found out.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Precisely because this was his first relationship, and there
        <p></p>was no room for error, Amane knew he should be as
        <p></p>considerate as possible, and since it would also really hurt
        <p></p>him if she cried or ended up hating him. He wanted to grant
        <p></p>all of Mahiru's wishes.
        <p></p>With his heart set on that, he stared back at Mahiru, who
        <p></p>squirmed like she wanted to run away but then leaned
        <p></p>against Amane's shoulder.
        <p></p>"I-it's fine; you can do whatever you like," she said. "Just
        <p></p>don't tickle me or pinch my belly."
        <p></p>"…You don't have anything to pinch, do you?"
        <p></p>"Well, I do keep a close eye on my figure, but whether or
        <p></p>not I have anything extra there, girls generally hate getting
        <p></p>their bellies squeezed by their boyfriends."
        <p></p>"Well, I don't plan on doing anything you would hate,
        <p></p>but…um, is it really okay?"
        <p></p>"I told you: It's fine."
        <p></p>Mahiru had stated definitively that he could do as he
        <p></p>pleased, but still, maybe she felt there was something a little
        <p></p>scary about allowing a guy to touch her however he wanted,
        <p></p>even if that guy was her boyfriend. Through the shoulder
        <p></p>that she was leaning on, Amane felt a slight shiver run
        <p></p>through her body.
        <p></p>He was happy she accepted him, but on the other hand, he
        <p></p>knew he would have to be careful because it would still be
        <p></p>problematic if he was pushy about it.
        <p></p>He really wanted to touch her but didn't know what to do,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>so after puzzling over it for a long ten seconds, Amane
        <p></p>pushed her up from his shoulder and embraced her gently
        <p></p>like he was trying to wrap himself around her whole body.
        <p></p>He could tell that her small frame was shaking and curling
        <p></p>up with surprise inside his arms, so in an effort to relax her,
        <p></p>with gentle, deliberate movements, he patted her back to
        <p></p>calm her down.
        <p></p>He didn't want to frighten her, and with that in mind, he
        <p></p>touched her with careful gestures. Mahiru relaxed and
        <p></p>leaned against him.
        <p></p>"…You don't have to worry; I won't do anything more."
        <p></p>"I-I'm not particularly scared… Just, well, first I'm
        <p></p>embarrassed, and…I was expecting more, I guess."
        <p></p>"Expecting…?"
        <p></p>"You know…a kiss or something."
        <p></p>Mahiru whispered the last bit weakly as she nuzzled her
        <p></p>cheek against Amane's chest, and this time it was his turn to
        <p></p>tremble.
        <p></p>"…A-Amane, I know you really love me, and that you've
        <p></p>been cherishing me like some treasured object, but…I want
        <p></p>to really feel your love."
        <p></p>Amane felt a swell of emotion at Mahiru's adorable words.
        <p></p>Although she always radiated of cuteness, she unconsciously
        <p></p>hit her boyfriend with an extra-large helping, and Amane's
        <p></p>head started spinning.
        <p></p>If he wasn't careful, he was going to grasp her tightly and
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>never let go, so he had to bite his lip hard and suppress that
        <p></p>urge.
        <p></p>"I know you don't want to rush me, and you're not going
        <p></p>to…to coax me into anything, but…"
        <p></p>Mahiru was mumbling in a tearful voice, with an
        <p></p>expression that was shy and apologetic.
        <p></p>Unable to bear it any longer, Amane buried his face in her
        <p></p>collar.
        <p></p>"…I can't take this anymore."
        <p></p>His quiet whisper seemed to have reached Mahiru's ears,
        <p></p>since she was trembling uneasily. He didn't want her to
        <p></p>misunderstand, so he peered into her teary eyes and
        <p></p>continued.
        <p></p>"Here's the thing, Mahiru. When you say stuff like that,
        <p></p>it's hard for me to resist. But if we go forward, I'm never
        <p></p>going to want to go back."
        <p></p>Hoping that hearing his plea would do her some good,
        <p></p>Amane squeezed her in a tight embrace as he mumbled his
        <p></p>objections.
        <p></p>"I think you ought to value yourself a little more, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"I—I do, but we're in love, so I want you to do as you
        <p></p>please."
        <p></p>"Please stop with the suggestive statements. You shouldn't
        <p></p>test a man's restraint."
        <p></p>"Test…?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…If you understand how much I love you, like you say,
        <p></p>then you're being a terrible temptress."
        <p></p>Amane did consider she might be stirring him up on
        <p></p>purpose, knowing he absolutely wouldn't make a move, but
        <p></p>he concluded there was no way that innocent Mahiru would
        <p></p>do such a shrewd thing. In other words, she was seducing
        <p></p>him without even knowing she was doing it. That was the
        <p></p>scariest thing about it.
        <p></p>Maybe because she sensed Amane's face pucker as he
        <p></p>tried to resist temptation, Mahiru's cheeks flushed slightly
        <p></p>as she looked up at him with a sweet gaze.
        <p></p>"…I trust you; you know?"
        <p></p>"I feel like my trust is being held hostage."
        <p></p>"Th-that wasn't my intention, though. I see that you're
        <p></p>conflicted, and somehow…that makes me happy. Wait, I—I
        <p></p>don't mean that I'm enjoying this or anything, okay? But the
        <p></p>idea that you treasure me so much, well, I can really tell, and
        <p></p>it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy—and so loved…"
        <p></p>In spite of himself, Amane looked at Mahiru after she
        <p></p>whispered these heartfelt words and received a fleeting,
        <p></p>bashful look in return.
        <p></p>"In the past, I learned all sorts of things from the
        <p></p>housekeeper, Miss Koyuki, so I know that people like you are
        <p></p>incredibly rare, Amane. People who listen to the feelings of
        <p></p>others and respect them. I know that you respect me—and
        <p></p>that you treasure me. That's exactly why you gave me the
        <p></p>right to choose earlier."
        <p></p>It was precisely because he treasured her that he didn't
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>want to do anything that would clash with Mahiru's feelings
        <p></p>—this sentiment of Amane's had indeed been conveyed to
        <p></p>her, and it was with that understanding that Mahiru was
        <p></p>begging him to act on his desires.
        <p></p>Amane was speechless as Mahiru looked up at him
        <p></p>timidly once again.
        <p></p>"From the bottom of my heart, I'm so glad I fell in love
        <p></p>with a guy like you."
        <p></p>Seeing Mahiru wearing a smile packed full of joy,
        <p></p>happiness, and love, Amane reached his limit—he pressed
        <p></p>his lips against her tender, soft, pale cheek.
        <p></p>Her cheek was incomparably smooth compared to his
        <p></p>own skin, and he gave her the tenderest of light kisses,
        <p></p>putting all his love into it. Starting from the spot he had
        <p></p>kissed, her pale skin flushed pink.
        <p></p>"All right, there… I kissed your cheek; was that okay?"
        <p></p>He had followed through, but now he was worried that it
        <p></p>would have been better to warn her before he did…
        <p></p>Although, it was already too late for that.
        <p></p>An amused, happy smile blossomed across Mahiru's face.
        <p></p>"…I feel like that's not something you need to ask after
        <p></p>you've already gotten permission."
        <p></p>"I couldn't help it… I just—my self-control was at its limit,
        <p></p>you could say. Sorry for indulging myself."
        <p></p>"You really are a conscientious person. Of all the things
        <p></p>you could do to me, the only ones I would hate are… Well, I
        <p></p>wouldn't like being tickled or having my cheeks pinched, but

        <p></p>really, there's nothing else, okay?"
        <p></p>Then Mahiru gently brought her lips to Amane's cheek in
        <p></p>retaliation. After kissing him, she moved them close to his
        <p></p>ear as he sat there, frozen.
        <p></p>"Listen, I'm never going to object to getting a kiss from
        <p></p>my boyfriend."
        <p></p>Oh my god…!
        <p></p>Agonizing over what a bad boyfriend he had been, to be
        <p></p>blind to that obvious fact, Amane planted another gentle kiss
        <p></p>on Mahiru's porcelain cheek.
        <p></p>He forced himself to get ahold of the desires that were
        <p></p>swirling around inside of him, and he embraced Mahiru's
        <p></p>small body again, simply appreciating how lovable his
        <p></p>girlfriend was.
        <p></p>"So stop me if I get crazy, please. This is already a lot…"
        <p></p>"Crazy?"
        <p></p>"I feel like I might lose control, you know? I've got no
        <p></p>willpower to spare. I know that's pretty pathetic, but…"
        <p></p>"…And if you did go wild, what would happen?"
        <p></p>"I'd probably make you cry."
        <p></p>He wasn't going to force her into anything, and he
        <p></p>obviously didn't want to make her cry, but Amane felt like
        <p></p>there was something inside him that he couldn't control.
        <p></p>Embracing her, and feeling her soft body against his, filled
        <p></p>him with urges that were hard to resist. The very fact that he
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>had endured it thus far was practically a miracle.
        <p></p>He suspected Mahiru might not stop him if he kept going,
        <p></p>but it was precisely because of how much he cared for her
        <p></p>and wanted to treasure her that he couldn't allow himself to
        <p></p>take things any further.
        <p></p>Instead, in order to rein in his hopeless urges, he loosened
        <p></p>his hold on her just a little.
        <p></p>Amane caught a whiff of her sweet scent, which somehow
        <p></p>seemed even stronger than it had been before, as he slowly
        <p></p>pressed his lips against her neck.
        <p></p>His touch was light on her slender neck, which was so
        <p></p>pale that the blood vessels showed through, and her slim
        <p></p>body shivered. But she didn't seem to dislike it. She just
        <p></p>twisted a little bit as if it tickled.
        <p></p>Slowly, he slid his mouth down, and when he reached the
        <p></p>base of her neck, Amane filled his nose with her scent and
        <p></p>bit down gently.
        <p></p>Of course, he didn't bite hard enough to leave behind
        <p></p>tooth impressions. Though it was a light nibble, Mahiru
        <p></p>made a high-pitched noise. But she didn't try to escape from
        <p></p>his arms. She gripped Amane's shirt tightly and let him do as
        <p></p>he pleased.
        <p></p>Her irresistible sweetness threatened to overwhelm him
        <p></p>again, but he kept ahold of himself, and finally, in a spot that
        <p></p>he figured would be covered by her school uniform, he
        <p></p>gently sucked on her skin.
        <p></p>Staring at the single dot of rosy color on her otherwise
        <p></p>pale white skin, Amane felt guilt, affection, excitement, and
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>a faint sense of dominance and conquest. When he was
        <p></p>done, he was left with the keen feeling that he was a
        <p></p>despicable man.
        <p></p>He slowly looked up and saw Mahiru staring at him with
        <p></p>teary eyes and a bright-red face. There wasn't the slightest
        <p></p>bit of hatred in her gaze, but her expression was filled with
        <p></p>embarrassment.
        <p></p>Amane immediately knew that he had overdone it, and he
        <p></p>hung his head. "Um… I'm really sorry about that. That
        <p></p>wasn't right."
        <p></p>Mahiru opened her tightly pursed lips and, without
        <p></p>hesitation, bit down suddenly on the base of his neck near
        <p></p>his shoulders, just above the collar of his T-shirt.
        <p></p>He could almost hear the adorable sound effects as she
        <p></p>chomped down, then kept nibbling as she tried and failed to
        <p></p>suck at his skin with her mouth. From the way she was
        <p></p>moving, it was more like she was trying to eat him.
        <p></p>After a moment, Mahiru pulled her mouth away. She
        <p></p>made a face as if she didn't understand why she had failed to
        <p></p>leave even the faintest impression on Amane's skin. She
        <p></p>must have felt his eyes on her and looked up at him with an
        <p></p>expression that was somewhat sulky and childish, yet also
        <p></p>daring.
        <p></p>"…Fair's fair."
        <p></p>The tone of her voice challenged him to complain. Along
        <p></p>with the fact that she hadn't even been able to leave a mark,
        <p></p>it was so adorable Amane thought he might die.
        <p></p>Though he was filled with a desire to hug her tightly and
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>carry her right off to bed, Amane somehow managed to hold
        <p></p>back. "You dummy," he groaned as he buried his face in the
        <p></p>base of her neck again, careful not to start sucking on a new
        <p></p>spot.

        <p></p>Chapter 62: The Start of Summer Vacation 
        <p></p>"Hyah-ha! Our summer vacation is finally heeere!"
        <p></p>"Why are you going wild?"
        <p></p>It was late July. With the closing ceremony finished and
        <p></p>the end of homeroom, the students were finally free. They
        <p></p>excitedly set about discussing their summer plans.
        <p></p>Itsuki had been wound up ever since the moment they
        <p></p>were dismissed, while Amane looked on, sweltering in the
        <p></p>heat.
        <p></p>"Why? Isn't it obvious? Today marks the end of those
        <p></p>hellish classes. Heaven… Paradise has come at last…!"
        <p></p>"Just because you don't like studying doesn't mean that
        <p></p>everybody else hates it."
        <p></p>"Zip it, brainiac. And anyway, you'll have more time to
        <p></p>make out with Mahiru, you know?"
        <p></p>"Make out… Listen, man, it's not like we're on each other
        <p></p>twenty-four seven."
        <p></p>Rather, they spent most of their time doing their own
        <p></p>thing, not even talking to one another.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>When they were spending time together in the same
        <p></p>space, someone was either studying or doing their chores;
        <p></p>they weren't just flirting.
        <p></p>Mahiru, of course, had her schoolwork, and in addition,
        <p></p>she exercised for her health and beauty—and took care of
        <p></p>her appearance. While she did that, Amane would go
        <p></p>running or do his weight training, so the assumption that
        <p></p>they were always joined at the hip was completely wrong.
        <p></p>"…If I'm being honest, it seems you've got a mental block
        <p></p>against flirting, so you do it unconsciously," Itsuki said.
        <p></p>"How so?"
        <p></p>"I bet you make eye contact and smile from time to time,
        <p></p>and lean against each other, and hold hands…"
        <p></p>Amane couldn't deny that.
        <p></p>He and Mahiru didn't embrace all that often, but smaller
        <p></p>forms of physical affection were a part of their daily routine.
        <p></p>It was hard to know whether that was considered flirting,
        <p></p>exactly, so Amane hadn't counted that, but apparently it did.
        <p></p>"Look here. You two are so flirtatious, I get hot just
        <p></p>looking at you. Right, Yuuta?"
        <p></p>"Ah-ha-ha, that's right. How can I put it? I get
        <p></p>embarrassed just watching you guys."
        <p></p>"You too, Kadowaki?"
        <p></p>"But you know, thanks to the PDA, very few people are
        <p></p>going to try to bother you, so I wouldn't say it's all bad."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Sure enough, there had been less harassment and fewer
        <p></p>complaints than Amane had assumed were in store for him,
        <p></p>and at least in their grade, none of the other boys seemed
        <p></p>like they were going to try to make a move to win over
        <p></p>Mahiru.
        <p></p>A big part of that was probably due to the way she acted,
        <p></p>how Mahiru didn't even try to hide the fact that she loved
        <p></p>Amane. She didn't so much as look at any other boys, so they
        <p></p>seemed to have mostly given up on her.
        <p></p>Even so, Amane had prepared himself for criticism and
        <p></p>bullying, but instead, many of his classmates seemed almost
        <p></p>protective. Frankly, Amane couldn't figure out why.
        <p></p>"You know, I bet the real reason that nobody's come after
        <p></p>you is 'cause they're scared of Mahiru."
        <p></p>"Scared?"
        <p></p>"You bet; she's keeping them in check, you know? I mean,
        <p></p>nobody's got the guts to try anything, after the way she acted
        <p></p>on Sports Day. If anyone tried to come after you, Amane,
        <p></p>she'd definitely flip out."
        <p></p>"Flip out… I can't even imagine it."
        <p></p>"Me either, but I bet she would be totally pissed. We all
        <p></p>know that she does well in her studies and sports and that
        <p></p>she's got a pretty face and a hot body. And on top of that, the
        <p></p>teachers all think she's great, so she would be a scary person
        <p></p>to make your enemy. Plus, you know it would be extra
        <p></p>terrifying if a person who is usually so nice got mad at you."
        <p></p>Amane quietly agreed with his friend's assessment.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>She is probably the type of person who you shouldn't
        <p></p>anger.
        <p></p>He had already said so, but he could hardly even imagine
        <p></p>Mahiru becoming furious.
        <p></p>But he did know that it would be a bad idea to tick her off.
        <p></p>Mahiru always wore a calm smile and wouldn't get angry
        <p></p>at any little thing, but Amane had a feeling that when she
        <p></p>crossed her boiling point, she was liable to knock her
        <p></p>opponent out with a sound argument and a smile. Thinking
        <p></p>back to what happened on Sports Day, it was a definite
        <p></p>possibility.
        <p></p>Amane knew better than to infuriate Mahiru, and anyway
        <p></p>he was pretty sure she would get sad before she got angry if
        <p></p>he did something wrong. He resolved to do his best never to
        <p></p>upset her.
        <p></p>"…Are you boys planning to make me mad?"
        <p></p>As Amane was making this vow to himself, Mahiru and
        <p></p>Chitose approached the boys.
        <p></p>"Oh, Shiina! No, not me—we were talking about whether
        <p></p>you would get mad if Amane did something."
        <p></p>"You should know the answer to that already… Of course I
        <p></p>wouldn't lose my temper. We would talk it out calmly, faceto-face, until he understood my feelings."
        <p></p>Her broad smile sent Itsuki trembling terribly.
        <p></p>Mahiru was telling the truth. She was most likely to
        <p></p>explain her feelings at length and get the other party to
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>understand her. Using a smile and a sound argument as her
        <p></p>weapons, she would corner the other person and compel
        <p></p>them to agree with her. She was really someone you
        <p></p>wouldn't want to make enemies with.
        <p></p>"Amane, don't you dare make Mahiru angry!" Chitose
        <p></p>scolded.
        <p></p>"Hey now, I'm not even doing anything!" Amane replied.
        <p></p>"…Actually, Mahiru, what would make you angry?"
        <p></p>"…An affair, maybe?" she answered.
        <p></p>"Do you think I'd cheat?"
        <p></p>"I don't think that at all! It's a ridiculous notion, given
        <p></p>your nature. You're the type of guy who is endlessly devoted
        <p></p>to the people you cherish."
        <p></p>"…Thank you."
        <p></p>"Although, that kind of devotion can wear you out. I think
        <p></p>you stopped at kissing my cheek because you ran out of
        <p></p>steam."
        <p></p>"…Mahiru."
        <p></p>"N-no, wait. I didn't mean to complain…and I did get
        <p></p>questions about that mark."
        <p></p>"Great, let's forget it."
        <p></p>If she was going to elaborate on how the mark came to be,
        <p></p>Amane would rather just not bring up the subject.
        <p></p>"Ah, is that—?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Itsuki."
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah, you two, my dear friends, are so painfully
        <p></p>shy. We do that much on a regular basis, right, Chi?" Itsuki
        <p></p>called out to Chitose. The two of them quickly started
        <p></p>pawing at each other.
        <p></p>Amane grumbled internally, We're not up to that level like
        <p></p>you two are!
        <p></p>Of course, the couple who had been dating for two years
        <p></p>had reached certain milestones that Amane and Mahiru
        <p></p>hadn't gotten to yet. He had heard about those kinds of
        <p></p>things from Itsuki before, so he wasn't exactly surprised, but
        <p></p>for some reason or other, he did feel somewhat
        <p></p>embarrassed.
        <p></p>Mahiru must have heard some stuff from Chitose, too,
        <p></p>because her face flushed red instantly, so he knew she was
        <p></p>probably imagining the same things as him.
        <p></p>...All that is probably a ways off, though.
        <p></p>They hadn't even kissed on the lips yet, so joining their
        <p></p>bodies together was a dream beyond a dream. He didn't
        <p></p>want to rush to it, either. It was better for them to approach
        <p></p>each other slowly, at their own pace.
        <p></p>When Amane made eye contact with Mahiru, her face got
        <p></p>even redder, and she looked down, so he averted his eyes
        <p></p>from his intensely embarrassed girlfriend.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, when is a good time for us to go visit my
        <p></p>parents?" Amane asked. After the closing ceremony at
        <p></p>school, Mahiru had gone home before coming over.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>He knew that he really should have already decided on the
        <p></p>dates, but he had been in a happy daze since they started
        <p></p>dating. They had also been busy with all sorts of things, so
        <p></p>he hadn't found the chance to talk to her about it, either. His
        <p></p>mother had said that any time was all right, so if Mahiru's
        <p></p>schedule was open, he figured he would go home in August
        <p></p>like he did every year during the Obon holidays.
        <p></p>In response to Amane's question, Mahiru blinked sharply
        <p></p>several times.
        <p></p>"…Ah, or maybe you don't like the idea of coming home
        <p></p>with me?" Amane stammered.
        <p></p>"N-no, I just remembered that we had talked about me
        <p></p>visiting… Um, any time is good for me." Mahiru anxiously
        <p></p>waved her hand in front of her face and insisted she wasn't
        <p></p>opposed to the idea.
        <p></p>Amane smiled meekly and moved on to his next question.
        <p></p>"Gotcha. I wonder how long we should stay? Last year I went
        <p></p>back for about two weeks, the week before and after Obon."
        <p></p>At the moment, he didn't have any standing invitations
        <p></p>from Itsuki or Yuuta and his friends around the time of
        <p></p>Obon, and most people generally spent that time with their
        <p></p>families anyway, so that was probably the best time to go.
        <p></p>They wouldn't have school, either, so that also made it a
        <p></p>good time to travel.
        <p></p>Last year, Amane had stayed a little over two weeks
        <p></p>because he enjoyed not having to do any housework while he
        <p></p>was there, but this year, Mahiru would be with him, so he
        <p></p>needed to take her plans into account. He figured one to two
        <p></p>weeks would be enough time to relax.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"I don't really have any plans, so… Chitose and I haven't
        <p></p>decided when we're going to hang out yet, so you can choose
        <p></p>when you want to take me along with you."
        <p></p>"Okay then, about two weeks should be good. That's a
        <p></p>pretty long time; are you sure it's all right?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>Mahiru said she didn't have any particular plans, so they
        <p></p>settled on the number of days that Amane had proposed.
        <p></p>As a girl, Mahiru apparently needed to bring lots of
        <p></p>clothes, so she suggested sending their luggage ahead of
        <p></p>time, and Amane messaged his mother to let her know to
        <p></p>expect it.
        <p></p>He didn't anticipate an immediate reply, since his mother
        <p></p>was probably at work, but he was sure she would happily
        <p></p>agree and try to get them to extend their stay. Amane's
        <p></p>mother loved anything cute, and she was extremely smitten
        <p></p>with Mahiru.
        <p></p>"I tell you, I bet my mom's going to be thrilled."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, I bet you're right."
        <p></p>"…You'd better prepare yourself, though."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"My mother is gonna want to spend time with you."
        <p></p>Amane was certain his mother was going to make a pest of
        <p></p>herself. She had always wanted a daughter, and she was
        <p></p>liable to conduct herself as if fortune had granted her one at
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>last—and dote on Mahiru the whole time they were there.
        <p></p>"I appreciate her company, though…"
        <p></p>"Well, that's good, but…the thing is…"
        <p></p>"What?"
        <p></p>"…I wonder whether we should tell my parents that we've
        <p></p>started dating?"
        <p></p>When Amane hesitantly mumbled this question, Mahiru
        <p></p>stiffened.
        <p></p>Amane hadn't told his parents yet, and apparently neither
        <p></p>had Mahiru. If they went to his house together, his mother
        <p></p>would be able to tell from the way they acted, and she would
        <p></p>probably tease them. He was conflicted over whether it
        <p></p>would be better to try to mitigate the damage by saying
        <p></p>something in advance.
        <p></p>But the scary thing about his mother was that Amane had
        <p></p>no idea whether telling her beforehand would make it any
        <p></p>easier—or if it would conversely make it worse.
        <p></p>"…Wh-what should we do? It would be embarrassing to
        <p></p>make a formal announcement."
        <p></p>"I know. But she's definitely going to pry."
        <p></p>"Well, since I'm making their precious son a part my life, I
        <p></p>think I should address them personally."
        <p></p>"I'm the one who's going to make you a part of my family,
        <p></p>though…"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane said it almost as if he considered it a settled
        <p></p>matter, but the moment Mahiru heard it, her face turned
        <p></p>bright red, and she hugged a cushion tight.
        <p></p>"…You know I appreciate that you can say stuff like that
        <p></p>without hesitation, but saying it too easily is a bad thing."
        <p></p>"Which is it?"
        <p></p>"Well, as long as you only say it to me, it's a good thing."
        <p></p>"Do you think I would say that about anyone other than
        <p></p>you…?"
        <p></p>Amane wondered what Mahiru was worried about. She
        <p></p>must have known full well that he didn't even look at other
        <p></p>girls.
        <p></p>"…That, too, is another good quality of yours. And I think
        <p></p>it must be the result of your father's upbringing."
        <p></p>"Why my father?"
        <p></p>Amane was confused by Mahiru's sudden mention of him.
        <p></p>She leaned against Amane, still holding the cushion, so for
        <p></p>the moment, he just stroked her hair.
        <p></p>He did it lovingly, not to try to appease her, but out of
        <p></p>pure affection, and Mahiru let him do it, casting her eyes
        <p></p>down bashfully. She looked like she was enjoying it, so
        <p></p>Amane figured she didn't mind.
        <p></p>"…I bet you're going to be a lot like your father in the
        <p></p>future, Amane."
        <p></p>"Really? I don't have as much of a baby face as he does,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>though."
        <p></p>"Not in the looks department, but on the inside."
        <p></p>"I'm not confident that I'll turn out as calm and
        <p></p>composed, either."
        <p></p>"…That's not what I meant…dummy."
        <p></p>Mahiru whispered that last word so quietly it just barely
        <p></p>reached Amane's ears, and she leaned against his arm, so
        <p></p>when he deliberately shifted his body back, she fell and
        <p></p>plunked down into his lap.
        <p></p>He watched the caramel color disappear and reappear
        <p></p>several times behind her blinking eyes, then he smiled and
        <p></p>cupped his hand around her cheeks.
        <p></p>"I can't be as gentlemanly as him, but I'd like to spoil you
        <p></p>in my own way."
        <p></p>"…See, this is what I was talking about."
        <p></p>"My dad indulges my mom way more than I indulge you."
        <p></p>"…He does. I think I would drown in it."
        <p></p>Still resting her head in his lap, Mahiru placed her own
        <p></p>hand on top of Amane's, as if to cover it, and closed her eyes
        <p></p>with a peaceful expression.
        <p></p>A smile appeared on Mahiru's lips as she leaned up and
        <p></p>pressed her cheek against him.
        <p></p>"…Maybe you could drown me a little more?"
        <p></p>"As much as you like… Although, we'd be in trouble if you
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>did at the pool next week."
        <p></p>"…Dummy."
        <p></p>This time, she delivered the adorable insult in a peevish
        <p></p>voice, loud enough for him to hear clearly, and Amane
        <p></p>laughed out loud and stroked Mahiru's cheek again.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 63: If Anything, You’re Cute 
        <p></p>Today, they visited the pool, and Amane was getting
        <p></p>changed in the locker room, feeling vaguely nervous.
        <p></p>He and Mahiru were at a water park on the outskirts of
        <p></p>the city, and they had split up to get changed, but…Mahiru
        <p></p>had been the subject of many stares from other guys before
        <p></p>they even entered the facility, and it wasn't hard to imagine
        <p></p>that they would all be mesmerized by her in her swimsuit.
        <p></p>In a situation like this, Chitose could have been a good
        <p></p>distraction if she were there, but today, it was just the two of
        <p></p>them. Mahiru had made puppy-dog eyes and said she
        <p></p>wanted to go alone together, and there was no way he could
        <p></p>turn her down.
        <p></p>Resolving that he would have to protect her somehow
        <p></p>from the groping hands of other guys, Amane changed into
        <p></p>his swimsuit, pulled on his rash guard, and left the locker
        <p></p>room.
        <p></p>He arrived at the agreed-upon meeting place and waited
        <p></p>for Mahiru to show up, but she was taking a long time.
        <p></p>He wasn't going to complain; it was something he had, in
        <p></p>fact, anticipated. He figured it probably took girls longer to
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>prepare than guys, and that their locker room might be more
        <p></p>crowded.
        <p></p>Appreciating again how tough it must be to be a girl,
        <p></p>Amane leaned back against the sturdy lamppost they had
        <p></p>chosen as their meeting spot.
        <p></p>Even though it was summer vacation, it was a weekday, so
        <p></p>while there were relatively fewer people than there might
        <p></p>have been, the place was still pretty packed.
        <p></p>As Amane was standing there absently watching people of
        <p></p>all ages, men and women, pass by in their swimsuits, he
        <p></p>caught sight of familiar flaxen hair in the gaps between the
        <p></p>crowd.
        <p></p>"Amane."
        <p></p>As expected, his own darling girlfriend was headed his
        <p></p>way.
        <p></p>But as soon as he saw her, he wondered whether it might
        <p></p>have been a mistake to bring her to the pool. The eyes of
        <p></p>many other patrons were following her as she approached
        <p></p>him.
        <p></p>Normally, he wasn't so conscious of it, but Mahiru was
        <p></p>truly extraordinarily beautiful. She was equal to any model
        <p></p>in a magazine—in fact, he thought Mahiru was even prettier.
        <p></p>So as expected, she was going to attract a lot of attention
        <p></p>in her bathing suit.
        <p></p>"Sorry to keep you waiting; the locker room was
        <p></p>crowded."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Uh-huh."
        <p></p>They were right by the water, so Mahiru hurried over,
        <p></p>without running, and stood before Amane, who was smiling
        <p></p>faintly.
        <p></p>Now that she was standing right in front of him in her
        <p></p>swimsuit, Amane really wasn't sure where to look.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed like the type whose skin would turn red
        <p></p>and painful if she got too much sun, and she was much more
        <p></p>careful about sun exposure than most people, so she was
        <p></p>strikingly pale. There wasn't a single blemish on her milkwhite skin, which had never known a sunburn. Standing
        <p></p>there under the summer sun in her swimsuit, she was
        <p></p>dazzling—in a single word, magnificent.
        <p></p>Amane had always known that Mahiru was slender, but
        <p></p>she really was fit. Though she was slim, she didn't look too
        <p></p>skinny, and her figure retained an unmistakably feminine
        <p></p>softness. She wasn't just thin, she had curves in all the right
        <p></p>places, like the soft, full line of her bust beneath her frilly
        <p></p>white bikini top.
        <p></p>Amane had always assumed Mahiru chose clothing that
        <p></p>minimized her bust, but he'd never realized the extent of it.
        <p></p>Yet they weren't so big that they looked unnatural or
        <p></p>mismatched with her small stature. They were the ideal size,
        <p></p>well-balanced and just right to fit in his hands.
        <p></p>He was shocked that modest Mahiru had picked a bikini,
        <p></p>but there was nothing lewd about her choice. The large frills
        <p></p>at the top hid her cleavage, and on Mahiru, the outfit looked
        <p></p>elegant and clean.
        <p></p>Seeing Mahiru in her bathing suit made his head spin.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane had never looked at anything racier than the pinups
        <p></p>in the backs of magazines. Seeing his girlfriend in one was
        <p></p>dazzling.
        <p></p>"…How is it?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had come close enough to touch, and she asked
        <p></p>for his opinion with her hand on her chest, as if she was
        <p></p>feeling a little embarrassed.
        <p></p>Because Amane was a little taller, he found himself
        <p></p>staring down at the shadow of her bust beneath the frills,
        <p></p>gulping.
        <p></p>"Amane?"
        <p></p>When he didn't answer, Mahiru inquisitively touched his
        <p></p>arm, and finally he unfroze.
        <p></p>"…D-does it suit me?" she asked.
        <p></p>There was no question about that. In fact, it suited her too
        <p></p>well, and he didn't know how to look at her.
        <p></p>"Absolutely. It looks great on you. I wish we were alone;
        <p></p>it's very cute."
        <p></p>"Th-thank you."
        <p></p>Amane shared his thoughts, knowing that he was
        <p></p>supposed to compliment girls on their clothes and that he
        <p></p>wouldn't be much of a man if he couldn't offer one or two
        <p></p>when his adorable girlfriend had done her very best to pick
        <p></p>out a swimsuit. Mahiru exhaled in relief.
        <p></p>But it was easy to tell from the way she was blushing that
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru must have also felt embarrassed from being exposed
        <p></p>more than usual.
        <p></p>Amane thought that if she was so self-conscious, she
        <p></p>ought to have picked a suit with a little more coverage, like
        <p></p>maybe a one-piece. But he figured that her choice had been
        <p></p>influenced by Chitose, who was probably mostly to blame.
        <p></p>Even so…
        <p></p>Glancing around, there were a surprising number of men
        <p></p>staring at Mahiru in her swimsuit.
        <p></p>Even men who were with other women were looking at
        <p></p>her, completely engrossed, and some of them were even
        <p></p>getting slapped by women whom he assumed were their
        <p></p>girlfriends.
        <p></p>That was proof that just by standing there, Mahiru had
        <p></p>become the angel of the waterside. But as her boyfriend,
        <p></p>Amane wasn't having much fun. It was uncomfortable seeing
        <p></p>people ogle his girlfriend in her swimsuit.
        <p></p>"Of course, it looks great on you, but—"
        <p></p>"But?"
        <p></p>"…It's no good."
        <p></p>Amane took off his hooded rash guard and draped it over
        <p></p>Mahiru's shoulders.
        <p></p>Since she was so petite, the hem hung down to her thighs,
        <p></p>so he figured it was sufficient protection from wandering
        <p></p>eyes.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Of course, the beauty of her slender legs would probably
        <p></p>still draw attention, but he couldn't cover everything, so
        <p></p>there was nothing to be done.
        <p></p>"Put that on."
        <p></p>"But…what about you?"
        <p></p>"…What if I told you that I don't really want other guys to
        <p></p>look at you?"
        <p></p>That was how he really felt. He completely understood
        <p></p>why Mahiru attracted so many eyes, since he also
        <p></p>appreciated her ample feminine figure, but the truth was
        <p></p>that he didn't like it.
        <p></p>When he whispered his feelings into her ear, Mahiru's
        <p></p>cheeks turned so red it looked like she was sunburned, and
        <p></p>she answered quietly, "O-okay…"
        <p></p>He quickly zipped up the front of the rash guard and
        <p></p>heard disappointed sighs from all around them. Relieved
        <p></p>that he had protected his girlfriend from the wicked,
        <p></p>wandering eyes of other men, Amane rolled up one of the
        <p></p>loose sleeves until he could grasp Mahiru's hand.
        <p></p>"Come on, let's go."
        <p></p>"Okay."
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded weakly and squeezed his hand back, and
        <p></p>Amane started walking slowly.
        <p></p>Since they were by the water, he had intended to take her
        <p></p>hand when they were strolling in any case, to keep her from
        <p></p>slipping, but now it also served as a major deterrent to other
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>guys.
        <p></p>Walking by Mahiru's side as imposingly as he could,
        <p></p>Amane was headed for the shallow pool, when Mahiru
        <p></p>looked up at him and whispered, "…Amane?"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"…If we were alone, would you have looked at me in my
        <p></p>swimsuit for a long time?"
        <p></p>"If we were alone, I would have gotten my fill of looking,
        <p></p>and I probably would have found the courage to touch you,
        <p></p>too." Deliberately exaggerating to make fun of himself,
        <p></p>Amane added, "Though, of course, all that staring and
        <p></p>touching would be risky, so I'd have to try hard to restrain
        <p></p>myself."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked worried for some reason.
        <p></p>After seeming to worry about it for a full ten seconds,
        <p></p>Mahiru, still holding his hand, closed the distance between
        <p></p>them even more. To be more precise, she glued herself to his
        <p></p>arm. The soft feeling that reached him through the rash
        <p></p>guard made it Amane's turn to blush.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, you bumped into me."
        <p></p>"…In this case, I think it's more accurate to say that I'm
        <p></p>touching you."
        <p></p>"The angel part of you isn't doing her job."
        <p></p>"When girls are with someone they like, they can become
        <p></p>angels or devils."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Apparently, Mahiru was a devil today.
        <p></p>Despite that, she was shaking terribly with
        <p></p>embarrassment and her face was bright red. But she didn't
        <p></p>seem inclined to let go of him and purposely pressed her
        <p></p>chest into Amane's arm, right above his elbow, so that he
        <p></p>could scarcely bend the limb without burying it right
        <p></p>between her breasts.
        <p></p>"…I don't really mind you staying close, but you should
        <p></p>know that I'm enjoying it."
        <p></p>"Th-that's a wild thing for you to say, but…I don't mind."
        <p></p>"…You dummy."
        <p></p>Amane hadn't expected her to approve. He groaned in
        <p></p>spite of himself and, contrary to his word, tried desperately
        <p></p>to distract himself from the soft sensation pressing against
        <p></p>his arm by mentally reciting the digits of pi that he had been
        <p></p>forced to memorize years earlier.
        <p></p>Hand in hand with Mahiru, who still drew plenty of looks,
        <p></p>Amane arrived at a comparatively shallow pool and,
        <p></p>swinging the small waterproof bag that he had in hand,
        <p></p>looked at Mahiru by his side.
        <p></p>"So what's the plan?"
        <p></p>"The plan?"
        <p></p>"I mean, the pools in this water park aren't really meant
        <p></p>for swimming lessons. Besides, you wouldn't know what to
        <p></p>do if I suddenly suggested you start swimming, would you?"
        <p></p>"That's true, but…"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane was a fairly good swimmer, so he was fully capable
        <p></p>of teaching her, but they weren't at a pool with separate
        <p></p>lanes that they could use for swimming class, so they were
        <p></p>sure to run into other people.
        <p></p>The pools in the park were mostly meant for people to
        <p></p>play in the water rather than do any serious swimming.
        <p></p>Those who really wanted to would surely take lessons.
        <p></p>"If you want to learn, that's fine, but as far as I'm
        <p></p>concerned… Well, since we came all the way here, I just want
        <p></p>to have a good time with you."
        <p></p>"Th-that's—um, me too. I'm happy just being here with
        <p></p>you, Amane." Mahiru turned her eyes up at him and pressed
        <p></p>herself close again. He was beginning to appreciate how
        <p></p>charming she could be while acting devilish.
        <p></p>To recover his composure, Amane patted his adorable
        <p></p>girlfriend on the head.
        <p></p>"All right, let's hang out and relax together. Besides, if we
        <p></p>were going to properly swim, you would have to take off that
        <p></p>rash guard."
        <p></p>Mahiru's slim yet voluptuous body was hidden by
        <p></p>Amane's rash guard, but the shirt would get in the way if
        <p></p>they started swimming, and she would probably need to
        <p></p>remove it.
        <p></p>If Mahiru did that, all the guys around them would
        <p></p>probably look at her, and Amane wouldn't be able to take his
        <p></p>eyes off her, either.
        <p></p>As her boyfriend, he felt like he didn't have to feel guilty
        <p></p>about checking her out in a swimsuit, but he worried that
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>staring at her beauty for too long would give him a heart
        <p></p>attack. The area under her bikini top was especially
        <p></p>dangerous to look at.
        <p></p>"…Do you plan to keep me hidden forever?"
        <p></p>"No… Well, it seems wrong to show you off…"
        <p></p>"…Don't you want to look?"
        <p></p>"I mean, I do, but I have zero doubt that I'd die."
        <p></p>"Why would you die…?"
        <p></p>Mahiru sounded exasperated. Amane figured there was
        <p></p>no way that she could understand how he felt. As a man, he
        <p></p>wanted to look at her, of course, but he didn't know if he
        <p></p>could take it. The stress would kill him, socially and
        <p></p>spiritually.
        <p></p>"…Well, you almost died when you saw my naked chest,
        <p></p>didn't you?"
        <p></p>"Th-that's um—"
        <p></p>"By the way, it seemed like you were going to have trouble
        <p></p>looking at other guys' chests, but you appear to be handling
        <p></p>it okay today, huh?"
        <p></p>Given Mahiru's naïveté, Amane had been certain she
        <p></p>would feel awkward seeing other men in their bathing suits,
        <p></p>but so far, though she had been blushing at Amane's words
        <p></p>and actions, she didn't seem outwardly embarrassed by any
        <p></p>of them.
        <p></p>When he made that observation, Mahiru drew her
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>shoulders together bashfully.
        <p></p>"Um. I'm not interested in anyone but you, Amane… I'm
        <p></p>not looking."
        <p></p>"…Ah—"
        <p></p>"A-actually, my heart was pounding again today when I
        <p></p>saw you in your swimsuit, you know? Compared to before,
        <p></p>you're really…lean—and more fit. S-sexy is what I mean."
        <p></p>Mahiru glanced up briefly at Amane, then her eyes darted
        <p></p>around nervously.
        <p></p>The first time Mahiru had seen Amane's body must have
        <p></p>been when she was nursing him through that cold a long
        <p></p>time back. Certainly, compared to back then, everything
        <p></p>about him had changed, from the way he led his life to his
        <p></p>perception of himself. Back then, he had never even
        <p></p>considered trying to change his string bean body.
        <p></p>…I guess the results have been pretty good?
        <p></p>He knew he couldn't compare to anyone who seriously
        <p></p>went to the gym for bodybuilding, but Amane liked to think
        <p></p>that, for a high school student, he had done pretty well so
        <p></p>far.
        <p></p>"I mean, Amane, you're attracting attention, too, you
        <p></p>know? You're not too skinny, and you look really good—firm
        <p></p>but flexible."
        <p></p>"Thanks for saying so… It feels a little funny when you
        <p></p>compliment me, but it's kind of nice."
        <p></p>"Wh-what do you mean?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Like, to think that you were looking so closely, when you
        <p></p>always acted innocent before…"
        <p></p>"A-are you making fun of me? I mean, I want to get a good
        <p></p>look at the person I love."
        <p></p>As she said that, Mahiru looked directly at Amane's chest,
        <p></p>but her eyes immediately started darting around, which was
        <p></p>more like her.
        <p></p>She seemed to notice his little smile. Her cheeks flushed
        <p></p>again, and she opened her eyes wide.
        <p></p>"Y-you can't talk anyway, Amane! Your heart's pounding!"
        <p></p>Mahiru desperately slapped her hand down on Amane's
        <p></p>chest to feel his heartbeat, and there was no way he could
        <p></p>really hide it, so he nodded obediently.
        <p></p>Amane thought that any guy whose heart didn't pound the
        <p></p>first time they saw their girlfriend in a bikini wasn't a man at
        <p></p>all, so this was an entirely normal reaction. In fact, he would
        <p></p>have appreciated a little recognition for his self-control.
        <p></p>"…It would be crazy to think that my heart wouldn't be
        <p></p>pounding at the sight of the girl I love in her swimsuit,
        <p></p>right?"
        <p></p>"Th-that's true, but in that case, surely it's all right for
        <p></p>mine to be beating this fast, too?"
        <p></p>"Sure. I'm happy to know that."
        <p></p>That alone was evidence that she thought of him as her
        <p></p>boyfriend, which made Amane embarrassed and glad. But he
        <p></p>also felt like he was going to melt and wished she would tone
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>it down.
        <p></p>To Amane, who had calmly reassured her, Mahiru kept
        <p></p>moving her mouth like she wanted to say something to him.
        <p></p>But then she seemed to give up and pressed her lips tightly
        <p></p>shut as she flattened herself against his arm. She seemed to
        <p></p>realize that words weren't going to do the trick and tried to
        <p></p>win against Amane with brute force, so he pressed his lips
        <p></p>together, too, but this time he let her do as she pleased
        <p></p>without showing her the agitation she was hoping for.
        <p></p>"You didn't catch me off guard, so it won't work this
        <p></p>time."
        <p></p>"…He says, as his heart pounds even harder than before."
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>Amane turned away, betrayed by his own heartbeat, and
        <p></p>Mahiru let out a cheerful laugh and rested her cheek against
        <p></p>his shoulder.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 64: Poolside Playboys Are Expected 
        <p></p>Eventually, a thoroughly shaken Amane was able to
        <p></p>regain his composure, and he set foot into the pool with
        <p></p>Mahiru by his side.
        <p></p>For Amane, who was already at adult height, the water
        <p></p>came up to about his hips, but for Mahiru it reached her
        <p></p>solar plexus, which didn't make it seem particularly shallow.
        <p></p>She looked up at Amane with a slightly worried expression.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru, you're not gonna drown; you'll be fine."
        <p></p>"Amane, people can die by drowning in as little as thirty
        <p></p>centimeters of water."
        <p></p>"Okay, listen… I won't let that happen, but if by some
        <p></p>chance you do, I'll give you CPR."
        <p></p>In order to encourage her, he spoke cheerfully, but
        <p></p>Mahiru kept clinging to Amane's arm and looked up at him
        <p></p>again. In her eyes, he saw a little bit of sulking and a shade
        <p></p>of expectation.
        <p></p>"…You won't keep me from drowning?"
        <p></p>Without meaning to, his gaze locked on Mahiru after she
        <p></p>murmured this with a tone of slight disappointment.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>The small bulge formed by her pouting lips looked
        <p></p>dissatisfied and…kind of pleading, but he figured that was
        <p></p>his imagination.
        <p></p>Looking at her light-pink lips, which hadn't lost any of
        <p></p>their luster even though she wasn't wearing lip balm, Amane
        <p></p>gulped audibly. But there was no way he could cast away all
        <p></p>reason and kiss her then and there, so he shifted his gaze to
        <p></p>the side.
        <p></p>"…I-I'd like for us to wait a little bit longer, so…um, we
        <p></p>can't, not here."
        <p></p>"I—I never said that I want you to do it here. But, well…
        <p></p>I'm starting to wonder if you don't want to, Amane."
        <p></p>"Of course I don't not w-want to!! I always want to!"
        <p></p>Surely there wasn't a guy in the world who didn't want to
        <p></p>kiss the girl he liked. Even Amane, who was not a
        <p></p>particularly romantic person, still wanted to touch Mahiru a
        <p></p>lot and kiss her as much as he pleased.
        <p></p>He knew they had to work up to it step by step, and he
        <p></p>was confident that she would pull away if he was always
        <p></p>forcing his desires on her, so he had been holding back, but
        <p></p>it was unthinkable that he didn't want to.
        <p></p>At Amane's strong assertion, Mahiru once again flushed
        <p></p>red, pressed her forehead against his arm, and hid her face.
        <p></p>The fact that she was red all the way to her ears made
        <p></p>Amane think that he had said something wrong, and he
        <p></p>began to blush as well.
        <p></p>"…Y-you've got the wrong idea—"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Do I?"
        <p></p>"Well, it's not wrong exactly, but, um… If we do that, I'll
        <p></p>have a hard time today, so please just wait a little longer."
        <p></p>Amane had often been ridiculed by Itsuki for being a late
        <p></p>bloomer and a wuss, and at this point, he couldn't deny it.
        <p></p>From Mahiru's perspective, she was probably getting
        <p></p>really impatient with Amane. He was treasuring her too
        <p></p>much and moving at a slow pace, and she had been waiting
        <p></p>for him the whole time.
        <p></p>…I guess Mahiru wants to go further?
        <p></p>She must want to do more things that lovers do?
        <p></p>He looked down at Mahiru to confirm his thoughts, and
        <p></p>she had her eyes turned up at him with half of her flushed
        <p></p>face still hidden.
        <p></p>"…You do what you like, Amane. But Chitose said that
        <p></p>making yourself hold back too long isn't good… Don't overdo
        <p></p>it…"
        <p></p>"Ugh, Chitoseee—"
        <p></p>"A-after all, Chitose has been in a relationship longer than
        <p></p>either of us, so…"
        <p></p>"She's definitely been a bad influence on you, don't you
        <p></p>see?! L-listen, Mahiru, we can go at whatever pace feels right
        <p></p>for us. I'm not trying to go unreasonably fast, and, um…if we
        <p></p>rush too much, I think you'll end up floundering, too."
        <p></p>He believed she also wanted to move things forward, but
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>he was worried that if they hurried things, Mahiru would
        <p></p>feel like she was under too much pressure, so Amane
        <p></p>thought a slow pace was best.
        <p></p>Amane wanted to proceed slowly for his own sake, too,
        <p></p>since he didn't know what he might do if he let himself get
        <p></p>carried away.
        <p></p>When he appealed to her with earnest eyes, Mahiru
        <p></p>looked down, making an embarrassed face, and pressed her
        <p></p>forehead against his arm once more.
        <p></p>"O-okay. Um… Sh-should we go swimming?"
        <p></p>"Y-yeah, we should…"
        <p></p>"…This is my first time coming to a place like this, so
        <p></p>please tell me about everything."
        <p></p>She added quietly that she had rarely gone places with
        <p></p>other people, so Amane took her hand, and they walked to
        <p></p>the middle of the shallow pool.
        <p></p>He guessed that her family had probably never taken her
        <p></p>to any kind of amusement park before, and he felt sad for
        <p></p>her. He decided they should go experience one of those
        <p></p>together sometime.
        <p></p>"So over summer break, how about we check off all of
        <p></p>your 'firsts,' Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"…P-putting it that way is embarrassing, but…okay."
        <p></p>Mahiru flushed red but smiled happily. Amane beamed
        <p></p>back at her and pulled her along by the hand to a spot that
        <p></p>seemed to have slightly fewer people.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru had been anxious about potential drownings, but
        <p></p>perhaps because she was with Amane, she didn't seem
        <p></p>worried as long as they were just playing in the water.
        <p></p>When Amane rented an inner tube and handed it to
        <p></p>Mahiru, she grumbled about it with a slightly peeved
        <p></p>expression. "I feel like I'm being treated like a child…" Yet
        <p></p>maybe because it gave her a sense of safety, she put the ring
        <p></p>around her body.
        <p></p>While holding on to the tube, Mahiru relaxed and floated
        <p></p>on top of the water, gazing up at Amane with a placid look.
        <p></p>Amane was standing by the side watching her, just in
        <p></p>case, but the way things were going, he figured she wouldn't
        <p></p>have any trouble enjoying herself.
        <p></p>"This feels great, doesn't it?" Mahiru smiled, bobbing
        <p></p>around in her ring by Amane's side.
        <p></p>"Sure does," Amane leaned against the edge of the inner
        <p></p>tube and nodded.
        <p></p>Amane liked swimming but had never particularly cared
        <p></p>for playing around in the shallow pools. But being able to
        <p></p>spend a relaxing time with Mahiru was not a bad thing. If
        <p></p>they had been with Chitose and Itsuki, the two of them
        <p></p>would have wanted to play with a beach ball or go down the
        <p></p>waterslides or something.
        <p></p>That kind of stuff wasn't bad, either, but Amane liked
        <p></p>having some relaxing alone time with Mahiru.
        <p></p>"With the ring, you won't drown, and you can enjoy the
        <p></p>water as much as you like."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…But it's awfully humiliating, using one at this age."
        <p></p>"Even adult women use them all the time. Look, there are
        <p></p>people sitting in inner tubes over there, too."
        <p></p>Amane pointed to where some women in swimsuits were
        <p></p>floating with their backsides down in the holes of their rings.
        <p></p>Rather than using them as swimming aids, most of the
        <p></p>adults were chilling in similar positions.
        <p></p>Mahiru, who had stuck her body through the ring, looked
        <p></p>in the direction Amane was indicating, then excitedly stood
        <p></p>back up for a second and sat down into the ring.
        <p></p>Floating there with her body fully supported by the inner
        <p></p>tube, Mahiru blinked several times, then smiled, looking
        <p></p>mighty pleased with herself. She seemed to like it.
        <p></p>Her bare, milk-white legs, sticking out of the bottom of
        <p></p>Amane's rash guard, kicked and splashed in the water.
        <p></p>Her legs were slender yet amply soft, and Amane got
        <p></p>splashed in the face while he was captivated by their beauty.
        <p></p>Mahiru was giggling, wearing a happy, carefree smile.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't tell whether she had known where he was
        <p></p>looking, or whether she had done that on purpose, but…for
        <p></p>the time being, he splashed her lightly to get back at her, and
        <p></p>Mahiru's smile widened.
        <p></p>"Now you've done it, hey!"
        <p></p>She had probably been trying to snap him out of his
        <p></p>trance.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru launched another water attack against him, and
        <p></p>Amane smiled a little and struck back.
        <p></p>But since Mahiru was rather immobile in the inner tube,
        <p></p>she made for an easy target.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>With the palm of his hand, Amane gently splashed some
        <p></p>water onto Mahiru's chest, and she did the same back at
        <p></p>him. She must have also been holding back as this attack
        <p></p>only reached his chest.
        <p></p>Amane was fully soaked. The water still felt cool on his
        <p></p>skin. He smiled with his whole face and splashed Mahiru
        <p></p>some more.
        <p></p>He was going easy on her because Mahiru seemed liable
        <p></p>to flip over if he overdid it, but she was cheerfully kicking the
        <p></p>water in a stroking motion, splashing away.
        <p></p>Each time she kicked, she was thrown a little off-balance.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, hey—"
        <p></p>It would have been awful if she tipped over with the inner
        <p></p>tube, so Amane leaned against the ring to stabilize her, and
        <p></p>Mahiru clung tightly to him.
        <p></p>She was still frightened of falling into the water.
        <p></p>"If you thrash around too much, you're going to fall over."
        <p></p>"Uh…sorry."
        <p></p>"I'm right here, so it's fine, but…"
        <p></p>"…If I wasn't with you, I wouldn't have been playing
        <p></p>around so much," she whispered quietly.
        <p></p>Against his better judgment, Amane stared at Mahiru.
        <p></p>She wrapped her arms around his back, buried her face in
        <p></p>his chest, and continued, "…But I am with you, and I'm
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>having so much fun… The whole world is sparkling…
        <p></p>Besides, I knew you would help me if I needed it."
        <p></p>"…I, um, I don't know what to say when you tell me cute
        <p></p>things like that."
        <p></p>Amane's face automatically turned red at her whispered
        <p></p>words of love.
        <p></p>It made him want to groan.
        <p></p>How can she be so cute in every way?!
        <p></p>…I really love this girl…
        <p></p>Of course, this wasn't a surprise, but Amane could feel his
        <p></p>chest grow hot just from the affection she was directing his
        <p></p>way. He felt overwhelmed with love.
        <p></p>If they had been at home, he would have stroked her hair
        <p></p>and never let her go, but since they were in a public space,
        <p></p>he knew he had to restrain himself.
        <p></p>And so after hugging her for a moment, he whispered, "…
        <p></p>Once we get home, I'll show you how much I love you," and
        <p></p>then he let her go. Even though Mahiru was soaked through
        <p></p>with water, her face was as red as a boiled octopus.
        <p></p>"…That's all I've ever wanted," he heard her murmur.
        <p></p>Ultimately, it was Amane who ended up sinking. Holding
        <p></p>back a groan, he closed his eyes and tried to think about
        <p></p>something else.
        <p></p>Seeing Amane like that, Mahiru smiled with great
        <p></p>satisfaction, her cheeks still red, and whispered, "I want to
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>show you my love, too."
        <p></p>Amane glared at her, wondering if she wasn't already
        <p></p>doing so, with the way she was acting, and she smiled at him
        <p></p>again.
        <p></p>"I want a chance to be in control, too. Recently, you've
        <p></p>completely outwitted me."
        <p></p>"…No way, you came onto me so aggressively before we
        <p></p>were dating. It's still my turn."
        <p></p>"We're skipping over too many of my turns. I want to get
        <p></p>the chance to embarrass you, too."
        <p></p>"So that was your goal all along? …Argh."
        <p></p>Amane knew that Mahiru would have loved to embarrass
        <p></p>him whenever the opportunity presented itself, so he
        <p></p>steadied himself, ready to turn the tables on her.
        <p></p>Mahiru often toyed with him, exposing his pathetic side,
        <p></p>so in an attempt to gain the advantage for once, he made a
        <p></p>show of brushing back some of the hair on the side of her
        <p></p>head and planted a gentle kiss on her cheek.
        <p></p>She seemed to have confidence to spare, but Amane
        <p></p>somehow swallowed the shame that welled up inside him
        <p></p>and peered down at his adorable girlfriend, who was frozen
        <p></p>in place with a bright-red face.
        <p></p>"…Still love me?"
        <p></p>"N-not cute…"
        <p></p>"Well, I've never been much of a charmer. Here, let's go
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>take a break, shall we? I'll go buy us some drinks."
        <p></p>When he ruffled her soaking-wet hair, Mahiru seemed to
        <p></p>unfreeze. She mumbled sulkily, "I'll have an orange juice,"
        <p></p>and then she head-butted him.
        <p></p>It was obviously an attempt to hide her embarrassment,
        <p></p>so Amane laughed quietly and patted her head again.
        <p></p>"So this is what happens when I take my eyes off you?"
        <p></p>When Amane returned from buying drinks, Mahiru was
        <p></p>being hassled by two guys.
        <p></p>This is why I didn't want her out of my sight. This is my
        <p></p>fault, but—
        <p></p>Even though it was a weekday, there was still a long line at
        <p></p>the food court, so it had taken him some time, and sure
        <p></p>enough, two guys had come up to talk to Mahiru.
        <p></p>They were in public, so obviously the guys were less likely
        <p></p>to force her to go with them or anything, but as her
        <p></p>boyfriend, Amane was not amused. He didn't even want
        <p></p>random people to talk to her.
        <p></p>Mahiru herself was not even attempting to hide her
        <p></p>annoyance. Apparently strange men hitting on her didn't get
        <p></p>an angelic smile. She had zipped the front of the rash guard
        <p></p>all the way up and wasn't smiling, giving them no openings.
        <p></p>Amane sighed softly.
        <p></p>…They can't even tell how much they're bothering her, so
        <p></p>I doubt they're going to be able to pick up any girls, but…
        <p></p>To begin with, they should have been able to tell that a girl
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>sitting alone, wearing a men's rash guard, who looked like
        <p></p>she was waiting for someone, might already have a partner.
        <p></p>If they hadn't been able to guess, that didn't speak well for
        <p></p>their ability to pick up girls. And if they were able to but
        <p></p>decided to try to pick her up anyway, then they were real
        <p></p>jerks.
        <p></p>Amane was probably thinking such harsh thoughts
        <p></p>because he was annoyed that it was his girlfriend they were
        <p></p>hitting on.
        <p></p>Mahiru was sitting politely on the bench and probably
        <p></p>hadn't been able to escape from the men because she didn't
        <p></p>want to leave that spot until Amane came back. Deciding
        <p></p>that he would apologize to her later for making her wait, he
        <p></p>hurried over.
        <p></p>"Sorry for the wait."
        <p></p>The moment he spoke, holding their drinks in both hands,
        <p></p>Mahiru's face lit up. It was obvious that they had been
        <p></p>bothering her.
        <p></p>Mahiru's expression made her look like a completely
        <p></p>different person, and the guys gaped at her as if they had
        <p></p>been caught off guard. They turned to look at Amane.
        <p></p>The two exuded a subtle sense of superiority as they sized
        <p></p>him up, probably because he hadn't dressed up that day—
        <p></p>after all, he couldn't use styling wax when going to the pool,
        <p></p>so he'd only brushed and combed his hair, and it didn't look
        <p></p>as good.
        <p></p>"Sorry, but she's with me, so I'd appreciate it if you would
        <p></p>leave us alone."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane was used to people looking down on him, so he
        <p></p>wasn't bothered by their stares and smiled at them stiffly.
        <p></p>The guys' smirks turned even nastier.
        <p></p>"She's with you? Seriously? What a bad match!"
        <p></p>"A sad sack like you, with a girl like this…? Unbelievable."
        <p></p>Sorry for being a sad sack!
        <p></p>Amane knew he was plain-looking; he wasn't going to
        <p></p>argue that point. But as to whether he was a good or bad
        <p></p>match for Mahiru, well, he figured that these guys had to be
        <p></p>even less worthy of her. There was no way that the kind of
        <p></p>gaudy guys who walked around making passes at girls would
        <p></p>ever appeal to someone as elegant, beautiful, and ephemeral
        <p></p>as Mahiru.
        <p></p>The whole situation was a headache, and when Amane
        <p></p>was puzzling over how to argue with them without making
        <p></p>them angry, Mahiru suddenly chuckled quietly, "Heh-heh."
        <p></p>He looked at Mahiru, who had laughed out of nowhere,
        <p></p>and she was elegantly holding her hand over her mouth,
        <p></p>covering her smile.
        <p></p>"They're right," she said. "If I had to say whether you were
        <p></p>sunny or gloomy, you're a gloomy one."
        <p></p>"Don't laugh…"
        <p></p>"I know that my boyfriend isn't very cheerful. He's a quiet,
        <p></p>calm person."
        <p></p>Amane watched her attentively, unsure of what Mahiru
        <p></p>was trying to say, as she looked directly at the other guys for
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>the first time.
        <p></p>There was no kindness in her eyes. They seemed cold.
        <p></p>…I bet she's angry.
        <p></p>Mahiru hated it when people made fun of Amane. So he
        <p></p>expected her to show the guys how she felt. She seemed to
        <p></p>despise them.
        <p></p>"And even if he is gloomy, what's wrong with that?"
        <p></p>Mahiru's words didn't sound particularly angry.
        <p></p>But in a tone that said they didn't really understand the
        <p></p>problem, the would-be pickup artists responded with a
        <p></p>dumbfounded, "Huh?"
        <p></p>"I love him, whether he's sunny or gloomy, it doesn't
        <p></p>matter. I fell for the whole package—his personality, looks,
        <p></p>and attitude. Whether he seems like a good match is
        <p></p>irrelevant. My love for him isn't such a flimsy thing that I
        <p></p>would ever worry about such questions."
        <p></p>Mahiru made this definitive assertion, then smiled
        <p></p>sweetly at Amane.
        <p></p>He felt his chest grow hot as it was full of love and
        <p></p>affection, a smile she never would have shown the other
        <p></p>guys. Amane had never imagined anyone would tell him they
        <p></p>loved him in such a bold way, and while it was a little
        <p></p>embarrassing, the feelings of happiness came to him first.
        <p></p>"I hope that you boys meet wonderful girls someday who
        <p></p>think of you in the same way."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru beamed, but it wasn't the sticky-sweet smile like
        <p></p>gooey honey and chocolate mixed together that she always
        <p></p>used toward Amane. Mahiru finished them off with the
        <p></p>perfect angelic smile that she used in public, and the guys
        <p></p>stared at her, flabbergasted. Their faces were red, like they'd
        <p></p>been scalded by Mahiru's radiant smile. Amane briefly
        <p></p>thought that if she had shown them her real face, the one
        <p></p>that she only showed him, they would have been reduced to
        <p></p>ash.
        <p></p>"Ah, well, um…"
        <p></p>Stammering, one of the guys tried to reach a hand out
        <p></p>toward Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Hey, guys, over there."
        <p></p>Amane casually brushed the outstretched hand away and
        <p></p>pointed past them.
        <p></p>The guys turned to look where Amane was pointing and
        <p></p>saw that there was a man in a lookout tower who was
        <p></p>watching them.
        <p></p>The pool management took safety very seriously, so there
        <p></p>were lookout towers all over the place. The people posted
        <p></p>there were to caution patrons against roughhousing near the
        <p></p>water's edge and to keep anybody from drowning, but of
        <p></p>course they were also monitoring whether there were any
        <p></p>suspicious characters lurking about.
        <p></p>Once the two guys realized that the employee was looking
        <p></p>at them, they ran off in a hurry with embarrassed
        <p></p>expressions. Amane didn't feel bad for laughing at them for
        <p></p>being cowards, despite having had the courage to chat up a
        <p></p>girl out of their league who looked like she was already there
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>with a guy.
        <p></p>It was finally just the two of them, so Amane sat down
        <p></p>beside Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Sorry for taking so long."
        <p></p>He figured the first thing he needed to do was apologize.
        <p></p>After all, Mahiru had been placed in an uncomfortable
        <p></p>situation because he had left her alone.
        <p></p>"No, it was busy, wasn't it? Plus, that happens all the time
        <p></p>when I'm by myself."
        <p></p>"…I'm sure that's true, but it's my fault you were left
        <p></p>alone. I bet you were scared."
        <p></p>"They seemed to understand what I was saying, so I
        <p></p>wasn't afraid."
        <p></p>I doubt they were listening to you; I think they just left
        <p></p>because other people started staring.
        <p></p>The exchange probably would have gone on a little longer
        <p></p>if the pool employee hadn't been there. Amane would have
        <p></p>gotten fed up with it halfway through and tried to take
        <p></p>Mahiru's hand and leave, but whether the other guys would
        <p></p>have let them go was a different matter.
        <p></p>Amane handed Mahiru the orange juice she had requested
        <p></p>and drank some of his own soda through a straw.
        <p></p>"…You weren't scared?" he asked.
        <p></p>"No, more like upset that they ruined my good mood."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Sorry. Cheer up, okay?"
        <p></p>"It wasn't your fault, but…all right, okay, let me have a sip
        <p></p>of your drink, and it's a deal." Mahiru pointed to the soda
        <p></p>Amane was drinking and smiled impishly.
        <p></p>"I can't say no to you." He smiled wryly and handed her
        <p></p>his cup.
        <p></p>He could tell that she was acting deliberately playful so he
        <p></p>wouldn't feel too guilty, and he recognized the thoughtful
        <p></p>understanding behind her words.
        <p></p>Without saying anything more about what had just
        <p></p>happened, Mahiru took the soda from Amane and sipped
        <p></p>it…frowning with determination. Her eyes even filled with
        <p></p>tears.
        <p></p>It was a strongly carbonated beverage, but not enough to
        <p></p>cause such an intense reaction. Amane hadn't been bothered
        <p></p>by it, but that didn't seem to be the case for Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Uh, did it taste weird?"
        <p></p>"…No, I just rarely have carbonated drinks… They really
        <p></p>irritate the throat, don't they?"
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes were watering from the strong sensation.
        <p></p>Come to think of it, Mahiru only drank water, tea, coffee,
        <p></p>and sometimes fruit juice. That was it; he had never seen her
        <p></p>drinking a carbonated beverage before.
        <p></p>Mahiru wasn't that sensitive to spicy foods, but she didn't
        <p></p>seem to care for this kind of bubbly sensation.
        <p></p>"I'm surprised you would want a sip of something like
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>this; you never drink soda… So why did you want to try it?"
        <p></p>Seems like she could have anticipated this would happen.
        <p></p>He took his drink back from Mahiru and patted her head.
        <p></p>She looked up at him, eyes still watery from the fizziness.
        <p></p>"…Because I wanted to enjoy the flavor with you, Amane,"
        <p></p>she mumbled quietly.
        <p></p>Amane nearly dropped the soda, narrowly avoiding a
        <p></p>disaster.
        <p></p>…My girlfriend is utterly adorable.
        <p></p>Amane wondered if "utterly" might sound disparaging,
        <p></p>but he meant it as high praise. Also, he was in agony.
        <p></p>Even at the best of times, he found it hard to deal with
        <p></p>how cute her appearance and mannerisms were, and when
        <p></p>she said that she wanted to share the same drink, he had to
        <p></p>stifle a groan.
        <p></p>Mahiru was too cute to even look at. Amane turned away,
        <p></p>just holding on to Mahiru's hand, and she leaned against
        <p></p>him, hooking her arm in his.
        <p></p>"…Me too. I want a sip of your orange juice later."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, sure." Mahiru laughed faintly.
        <p></p>Without looking at her, he put his elbow up on the bench's
        <p></p>armrest and faced the opposite direction.
        <p></p>That was probably why he didn't notice them getting
        <p></p>closer.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Hey, you over there, the cute little lady and the sad sack
        <p></p>little boy, you wanna play with us?"
        <p></p>Someone called out to the two of them in a familiar,
        <p></p>easygoing tone. Amane recognized it, but he hadn't been
        <p></p>expecting to hear it.
        <p></p>When Amane looked toward the voice, he saw exactly the
        <p></p>faces he predicted:
        <p></p>A handsome, if shallow-looking, male and a boyish but
        <p></p>beautiful girl. Both faces he saw frequently at school.
        <p></p>Amane shot them a suspicious look without really
        <p></p>meaning to, but he didn't feel bad about it.
        <p></p>"Why are you here, Itsuki?"
        <p></p>"I'm not stalking you, promise. It's a coincidence,
        <p></p>seriously," Itsuki earnestly insisted. "You know I'm not that
        <p></p>nosy." He waved his hand dismissively.
        <p></p>Amane decided that their friends probably hadn't been
        <p></p>following them. For one thing, if they had been watching,
        <p></p>Itsuki and Chitose would surely have come to Mahiru's
        <p></p>rescue when she was getting hit on.
        <p></p>He figured that, in terms of timing, they had probably
        <p></p>spotted Mahiru after he'd rejoined her at the bench. It was
        <p></p>also clear from Chitose's expression that this was just a
        <p></p>coincidence.
        <p></p>"I mean, we heard that you were going to the pool
        <p></p>sometime this week, but of course I never expected to bump
        <p></p>into you in such a big place, even if we showed up on the
        <p></p>same day. Sorry for intruding on your lovey-dovey time."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Hey—"
        <p></p>Amane wasn't going to complain, since they had run into
        <p></p>each other by chance, but he cast a sharp glance at Chitose,
        <p></p>who had a big grin when she teased him.
        <p></p>Which is to say, he ended up glaring directly at her, since
        <p></p>Chitose was also in her bathing suit, and it would have been
        <p></p>rude to look at her body too much.
        <p></p>Chitose was wearing an orange top and swim shorts.
        <p></p>When she noticed Amane staring at her, she smirked again
        <p></p>and shouted, "Oh no, a pervert!" and wriggled around, even
        <p></p>though it was obvious from the direction of his gaze that he
        <p></p>wasn't looking at her body.
        <p></p>Letting out a huge sigh at Chitose's ridiculousness, Amane
        <p></p>appealed to Itsuki with an imploring look, but Itsuki said,
        <p></p>"It's summer, so she's got too much energy." He didn't seem
        <p></p>inclined to try to stop her.
        <p></p>Feeling exasperated, Amane turned to Mahiru and saw
        <p></p>that she had unzipped the front of the rash guard, which was
        <p></p>previously zipped up to hide herself from the wannabe
        <p></p>pickup artists. Even though it was a rash guard, she must
        <p></p>have been hot with the fastener closed all the way up to her
        <p></p>neck.
        <p></p>She had unfastened it down to her chest and was fanning
        <p></p>a little air through the shirt.
        <p></p>Chitose blinked at her, "Hmm? Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Yes?"
        <p></p>"…You wore that bikini?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"This one?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, I mean, you got the other black string— Mmph!"
        <p></p>Chitose's voice was muffled midway through her sentence
        <p></p>by Mahiru forcibly covering up her mouth.
        <p></p>Mahiru had risen halfway to her feet to reach Chitose. She
        <p></p>must have realized that Amane was staring at her, because
        <p></p>she froze.
        <p></p>"…It's nothing," Mahiru said, shaking her head. Her
        <p></p>cheeks were red.
        <p></p>"There was another swimsuit."
        <p></p>"No, ah, that one, well… I'm embarrassed to wear that one
        <p></p>in public, so…"
        <p></p>"You were about to spill out of it, huh? I thought it would
        <p></p>be cute for you to wear when you and Amane were alone—
        <p></p>Mmph!"
        <p></p>"Chitose, you need to shut up now."
        <p></p>"O-okay!"
        <p></p>Mahiru covered Chitose's mouth again. Chitose seemed
        <p></p>absolutely remorseless.
        <p></p>Amane was surprised to hear Mahiru had purchased a
        <p></p>swimsuit that she would be hesitant to wear in public, but
        <p></p>once she said that it was for when they were alone together,
        <p></p>his heart seemed like it would go crazy at the boldness of it
        <p></p>all.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Is it really that risqué?"
        <p></p>"Not really. Mahiru has good taste; it's just that it doesn't
        <p></p>cover much."
        <p></p>"Chitose…"
        <p></p>"If I say any more, I think she's really going to get pissed
        <p></p>at me, so please understand you'll just have to see it for
        <p></p>yourself, Amane."
        <p></p>"I-I'm not showing!"
        <p></p>Mahiru rejected the idea outright, her face as red as a ripe
        <p></p>apple. Amane didn't feel guilty about being a little
        <p></p>disappointed.
        <p></p>Of course, if Mahiru was opposed to it, he wouldn't tell
        <p></p>her he wanted to see it no matter what, but still, it would be
        <p></p>a lie if he said that he didn't want to see his girlfriend like
        <p></p>that.
        <p></p>From the way Chitose was talking, the other bathing suit
        <p></p>wasn't just revealing, it was a bold expression of Mahiru's
        <p></p>fine style.
        <p></p>At the moment, Amane was having a very hard time
        <p></p>looking straight at her, but assuming that the other one
        <p></p>revealed even more skin, Mahiru's refusal was probably his
        <p></p>saving grace.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>But of course, as a young man, he would have liked to see
        <p></p>it.
        <p></p>Maybe he looked a little disappointed, because Chitose
        <p></p>smirked, and Mahiru repeatedly glanced at him with
        <p></p>uncertainty.
        <p></p>"You won't show him?" Chitose asked.
        <p></p>"…That's not up for discussion right now," Mahiru feebly
        <p></p>responded. Then, as if to escape from Chitose's and Amane's
        <p></p>gazes, she put up the hood on the rash guard and hung her
        <p></p>head.
        <p></p>Even if Amane couldn't see her face, he could imagine that
        <p></p>it was burning red, enough to make it look like she had
        <p></p>gotten a sunburn.
        <p></p>"…Chitose, don't tease her too badly. And, Mahiru, you
        <p></p>don't need to worry about what I think."
        <p></p>"But she's such a cutie!"
        <p></p>"Why say something so obvious?"
        <p></p>"Oh, this boy's a natural…"
        <p></p>Mahiru being cute was an indisputable fact, but when he
        <p></p>agreed with her, Chitose looked at Amane with faint
        <p></p>amazement in her eyes.
        <p></p>Before they started dating, Amane already knew from the
        <p></p>beginning that Mahiru was cute, so it wasn't that surprising
        <p></p>of a thing to say. But his friends seemed to be bewildered to
        <p></p>hear him say it, and their eyes went wide.

        <p></p>"…Well, if you didn't wind up infatuated in the end,
        <p></p>Amane… You used to say you would never get a girlfriend
        <p></p>and never fall in love, but look at you now…"
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>"You know, the feeling of being in love will change a
        <p></p>person!"
        <p></p>"Will you two quit making fun of me? First of all, Mahiru
        <p></p>being cute is a well-known fact, and anyway it's normal to
        <p></p>think that your girlfriend is attractive. Itsuki, you're
        <p></p>constantly bragging about how cute Chitose is."
        <p></p>Itsuki had been going on and on about his girlfriend ever
        <p></p>since Amane had known him. Compared to that, Amane
        <p></p>hadn't said much at all.
        <p></p>When Amane turned the tables and looked fed up with the
        <p></p>two of them, insisting that it wasn't such a strange thing for
        <p></p>him to feel that way about Mahiru, they shrugged defeatedly.
        <p></p>Amane glared at them, feeling slightly irritated by their
        <p></p>attitude, but Itsuki just smiled wryly.
        <p></p>"Ah, but I think we'd better leave it there for now."
        <p></p>"What do you mean?"
        <p></p>"Mahiru looks like she's having a hard time."
        <p></p>At Itsuki's mention of Mahiru, Amane looked over and
        <p></p>saw she was holding the hood down over her head and
        <p></p>trembling, probably feeling extremely self-conscious.
        <p></p>He knew she felt shy about being complimented too much
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>in front of other people. She looked up at him, her eyes filled
        <p></p>with tears of mortification.
        <p></p>"…That's a good and bad thing about you, Amane," she
        <p></p>mumbled, hiding deep within the hood.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't do anything but wait for Mahiru to pull
        <p></p>herself together.
        <p></p>Once Mahiru recovered from her embarrassment, the four
        <p></p>of them hung out together, which was great because it made
        <p></p>it much harder for any other guys to approach Mahiru.
        <p></p>As long as the four of them moved as a group, no one
        <p></p>would be left alone, and Amane was paying close attention
        <p></p>to make sure it didn't happen again.
        <p></p>Moreover, since Itsuki was obviously outgoing and
        <p></p>handsome, the Platonic ideal of a cheerful guy, and the type
        <p></p>who had a friendly aura about him, any men who might have
        <p></p>been aiming to pick up one of the girls probably thought
        <p></p>better of it after one look at him.
        <p></p>However, since Chitose, Mahiru, and Itsuki were all
        <p></p>extremely attractive, Amane couldn't help but feel like all
        <p></p>eyes were on them.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, Mahiru, take this!"
        <p></p>"Kyah! …Geez, come on, Chitose!"
        <p></p>Without saying anything, Mahiru had pushed the group
        <p></p>toward playing in the shallow pool.
        <p></p>Mahiru and Chitose were happily splashing each other,
        <p></p>while Amane sat on the edge of the pool and watched them.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>It was charming, watching two girls who were such good
        <p></p>friends cheerfully playing around.
        <p></p>Also, they were both exceptionally beautiful in different
        <p></p>ways, so watching them was a feast for the eyes.
        <p></p>"Man, it's so nice to see the girls getting along like that."
        <p></p>Itsuki was sitting beside Amane, watching them with a
        <p></p>grin.
        <p></p>"You sound like a creepy old man," Amane replied.
        <p></p>"How rude! You're one to talk, ogling them while they
        <p></p>play."
        <p></p>"I'm not that bad."
        <p></p>"But I bet you were thinking about how nice it was to
        <p></p>watch, you taciturn guy."
        <p></p>"I could say the same about you."
        <p></p>"At least I'm honest about it," Itsuki quipped, gazing idly
        <p></p>at Mahiru, who was giggling as she splashed Chitose with
        <p></p>water.
        <p></p>"So why were you watching her with that faraway look in
        <p></p>your eyes?" Itsuki asked, wiping the foolish grin from his
        <p></p>face. He leaned forward a little bit and peered at Amane.
        <p></p>"Well, how do I put this? Mahiru seems to have gotten
        <p></p>even cuter than before."
        <p></p>"Listen to you, going on about your girlfriend, too."
        <p></p>"I'm not bragging; it's just—she smiles a lot now. She
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>didn't used to smile this way at all."
        <p></p>"We never saw her back then, but…do you mean she was
        <p></p>cold?"
        <p></p>"Yeah. She was always cool and had a sharp tongue. It was
        <p></p>because she didn't trust anyone… I was thinking it's nice to
        <p></p>see her this way now."
        <p></p>Compared to when they first met, Mahiru smiled much
        <p></p>more openly now.
        <p></p>She had a carefree smile and honesty to her that seemed
        <p></p>unrecognizable compared to the distant and sharp-tongued
        <p></p>Mahiru of the past.
        <p></p>Amane felt proud that Mahiru had changed because of
        <p></p>him, but it was also thanks to Chitose. Since they were both
        <p></p>girls, they could talk about things together and understand
        <p></p>each other.
        <p></p>Whenever he saw the two of them having fun together, as
        <p></p>they were just then, he felt really happy.
        <p></p>"I agree; I've also been thinking that Mahiru has changed
        <p></p>a lot. She used to be like some kind of statue, and hard to
        <p></p>approach, but now all I can see is a supercute girl who loves
        <p></p>Amane."
        <p></p>"Who loves me…? Listen—"
        <p></p>"I mean, it's easy to tell, with that much pure affection
        <p></p>directed your way. Even on a normal day, it's obvious that
        <p></p>she treats you special."
        <p></p>"…By the way, I want to ask, from what you could see, has
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru been interested in me for a really long time?"
        <p></p>"If anything, she was brimming over with love, wondering
        <p></p>what was taking you so long."
        <p></p>"Seriously?"
        <p></p>He'd had a vague inkling that she liked him since before
        <p></p>they started dating, but apparently Itsuki had seen it even
        <p></p>before Amane had considered the possibility.
        <p></p>"I think that Mahiru probably started to change around
        <p></p>the time she started to trust you and like you," Itsuki said.
        <p></p>"I wonder…?"
        <p></p>"And having Chi around maybe helped, too. She's
        <p></p>excitable and friendly, for better or worse, so she pulled
        <p></p>Mahiru out of her shell."
        <p></p>"…I'm begging you to get your girlfriend under control."
        <p></p>"It's fine, it's fine. Chi never treads where she really can't
        <p></p>go. Besides, look, they're smiling so much."
        <p></p>When Amane looked over to where Itsuki was pointing
        <p></p>again, Chitose was hanging onto Mahiru, who looked
        <p></p>embarrassed yet accepting of her own shyness.
        <p></p>He could tell from the look in her eyes and her soft
        <p></p>expression that Mahiru trusted Chitose as well. It was good
        <p></p>that she was finding more friends to depend on.
        <p></p>But he wanted to be person she relied on the most.
        <p></p>Itsuki patted Amane on the back to tell him not to worry,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>and Amane responded with a wry smile.
        <p></p>"Hey, hey, you melancholy young men there standing by
        <p></p>the poolside, come over here and play with us!" Chitose
        <p></p>waved at them as she clung to Mahiru.
        <p></p>Mahiru waved her hand reservedly, too, looking like she
        <p></p>wanted Amane to join them.
        <p></p>"When you get invited by a couple of cute girls, there's no
        <p></p>way you don't answer their calls." Itsuki plunged into the
        <p></p>pool with a grin and headed toward the girls. Smiling,
        <p></p>Amane watched him go, and he, too, took off toward Mahiru
        <p></p>and the others.
        <p></p>"Whew, we really played a lot!"
        <p></p>After enjoying themselves for several hours, they were
        <p></p>naturally a little tired, despite being high school students,
        <p></p>and the four teenagers sat down on a bench to rest.
        <p></p>They had borrowed a ball to play volleyball, and at
        <p></p>Chitose's insistence, Mahiru had tried going down a small
        <p></p>waterslide, which had been an exciting experience for her.
        <p></p>Sitting beside Amane, Mahiru looked refreshed but must
        <p></p>have been fairly exhausted, because she was leaning lightly
        <p></p>against him.
        <p></p>"That was fun, huh? It's been a long time since I played
        <p></p>like that," she said.
        <p></p>"Mm, me too," Amane agreed. "It's been a while since I
        <p></p>moved around that much."
        <p></p>"Well, you didn't participate any more than you had to at
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Sports Day, eh, Amane? I bet swimming was good exercise,"
        <p></p>Itsuki remarked.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't exactly unathletic, but sports still weren't
        <p></p>his strong suit, and he rarely got such a total workout. Even
        <p></p>during gym, though he took the class seriously, he never
        <p></p>worked his whole body into a good sweat.
        <p></p>"Partway, you went for a serious swim, didn't you,
        <p></p>Amane?"
        <p></p>"Well, a pool is a place for swimming, so…I think it's nice
        <p></p>to swim from time to time."
        <p></p>"Mahiru was watching you while you swam, you know?"
        <p></p>Chitose added.
        <p></p>"Ah, s-sorry, Mahiru."
        <p></p>Mahiru had been playing happily with Chitose, so Amane
        <p></p>had gone off to enjoy some light swimming, but he realized
        <p></p>he might have made her wait around for him.
        <p></p>But Mahiru shook her head.
        <p></p>"Y-you don't need to apologize, but…it must be nice."
        <p></p>After a little thought, Amane figured out what she meant.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't know how to swim, so she must have been
        <p></p>jealous of Amane, who could do so without any issues.
        <p></p>But he definitely wouldn't out her in front of Chitose and
        <p></p>Itsuki, so he just smiled softly and stroked her hair. If they
        <p></p>had another opportunity, it would probably be good to
        <p></p>practice swimming.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Let's go to the pool together again sometime," Amane
        <p></p>suggested.
        <p></p>"O-okay."
        <p></p>"Huh, what's that?" Chitose interrupted. "You say you
        <p></p>want to see Mahiru's black bikini?"
        <p></p>"You idiot, I definitely don't want to suggest she wear that
        <p></p>in public."
        <p></p>"But you want to appreciate it when you're alone?"
        <p></p>Chitose prodded.
        <p></p>"That's…different, since I'm her boyfriend, right?"
        <p></p>Thinking about Mahiru wearing a black bikini in front of
        <p></p>everyone made Amane uncomfortable. Even though she
        <p></p>wore his rash guard, he would have liked it if she had also
        <p></p>put on swimming shorts.
        <p></p>"Come on, Mahiru, you're not gonna show him?"
        <p></p>"I said we'll talk about it later."
        <p></p>Mahiru turned away uncooperatively. Amane smiled
        <p></p>slightly and patted her head gently again.
        <p></p>The group left the water park together and went to a
        <p></p>diner.
        <p></p>It was six o'clock, which was usually a little early for
        <p></p>dinner, but they had been swimming, playing, and using up
        <p></p>so much energy that they were hungry and figured it was the
        <p></p>perfect time to eat.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru had never had the chance to go to a diner before
        <p></p>and was a little nervous. She looked cute fidgeting, and
        <p></p>Amane laughed in spite of himself. She slapped him from an
        <p></p>angle that Chitose and Itsuki couldn't see, and he reined it
        <p></p>in.
        <p></p>"That reminds me—you're going to Amane's parents'
        <p></p>house over the summer break, right, Mahiru?" Chitose asked
        <p></p>as she cut into her hamburger steak.
        <p></p>Mahiru had probably told her she was going with Amane
        <p></p>to his family home so they could make plans together. Now,
        <p></p>of course, Chitose was smirking at him.
        <p></p>"Oh yeah, that—you're going there to introduce yourself,
        <p></p>right?" Itsuki asked.
        <p></p>"Unfortunately, Mahiru has already met my parents."
        <p></p>"Oh, that's right… Well, at this point, it's more like a wife
        <p></p>accompanying her husband for his homecoming, huh?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah, say whatever you like."
        <p></p>The two of them weren't even close to being married—or
        <p></p>even engaged. So Amane's first thought was to question
        <p></p>what Itsuki was saying. But it was unusual for high schoolers
        <p></p>in a relationship to go for such a long visit with each other's
        <p></p>parents, so there was at least something to his friend's
        <p></p>observation.
        <p></p>Amane quickly let the subject drop and took a bite of the
        <p></p>rolled omelet from the Japanese set menu. Chitose didn't
        <p></p>crack a joke, but instead she looked at him with
        <p></p>disappointment.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Ignoring her, he continued to eat, but somehow the eggs
        <p></p>were unsatisfactory. They had a bland, flat taste, unlike
        <p></p>Mahiru's omelets, and though he didn't complain, they left
        <p></p>him feeling unsatisfied.
        <p></p>Convinced that Mahiru's cooking was the best after all,
        <p></p>Amane glanced over at her and saw she looked slightly
        <p></p>embarrassed.
        <p></p>Apparently the talk of her being his wife made her shy.
        <p></p>"So you're going to Amane's house, huh…? His mom must
        <p></p>be thrilled," Itsuki remarked.
        <p></p>"You're acquainted with Amane's mother, Itsuki?"
        <p></p>"No, but I've heard about her… And from Amane's stories,
        <p></p>I've got a good picture of what she's like."
        <p></p>"My mom is a lot… Every time, it's like she's never met a
        <p></p>stranger."
        <p></p>It seemed like Itsuki had immediately been able to tell,
        <p></p>just by hearing about her, that Amane's mother had a lot in
        <p></p>common with Chitose. If the two of them met, they would
        <p></p>probably feel a sense of kinship.
        <p></p>"Huh, what's that?"
        <p></p>"Mm, just talking about how cute you are, Chi."
        <p></p>Itsuki casually dodged the question with a compliment,
        <p></p>and Chitose looked delighted.
        <p></p>"Oh, you!" she fawned. "Ah, and by the way, Amane, let
        <p></p>me know as soon as you've decided the dates for your trip
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>home. I want to hang out with Mahiru before you go."
        <p></p>"Sure thing. We'll probably go in August, so you can have
        <p></p>at it until then… Just don't forget to do your homework."
        <p></p>"Why do you sound like my mom?"
        <p></p>"I believe last year you made a big fuss about not being
        <p></p>done with your homework, so…"
        <p></p>Chitose was the type to procrastinate and then panic,
        <p></p>trying to get everything done before the end of the break.
        <p></p>On the other hand, Amane was the type to get it done
        <p></p>early then review a little every day, while Itsuki liked to work
        <p></p>slowly but steadily, so both of them had gotten stuck helping
        <p></p>Chitose with her work before.
        <p></p>This year Amane had already finished his assignments,
        <p></p>and Mahiru had as well, so they had been reviewing
        <p></p>together.
        <p></p>"But I don't wanna do it… Ah! Maybe this year I can get a
        <p></p>sweet angel to teach me?"
        <p></p>"I don't mind teaching you, but the next time you call me
        <p></p>an angel, I'm rescinding the offer."
        <p></p>"Ah, so strict! But I love stern Mahiru, too."
        <p></p>Thinking how charming it was to see Mahiru sharing
        <p></p>friendly banter with Chitose, Amane took another bite of his
        <p></p>food before it got cold.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, tomorrow I'd like to eat omelets."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>She was sitting beside him, and when he told her this in a
        <p></p>quiet voice, Mahiru's gaze shifted to the tray in front of
        <p></p>Amane.
        <p></p>"You're eating one right now, aren't you?"
        <p></p>"This one's no good. Somehow the flavor is lacking. Yours
        <p></p>are the best."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, you're hopeless. All right, I'll wake you up
        <p></p>tomorrow with breakfast."
        <p></p>"Mm."
        <p></p>During summer vacation, Amane stopped getting up
        <p></p>early, so he would be grateful for Mahiru if she did.
        <p></p>It would probably be bad for his heart to see her face first
        <p></p>thing, but there could be no doubt that it would be an
        <p></p>extraordinary way to start the day.
        <p></p>Amane was in a good mood, and as he looked forward to
        <p></p>tomorrow's breakfast, Itsuki stared at him in astonishment.
        <p></p>"You're basically living together…"
        <p></p>"Shut up."
        <p></p>Only half living together, but he didn't say that out loud
        <p></p>and quietly sipped his slightly cooled miso soup.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 65: Homecoming, and Revealing the Relationship 
        <p></p>"Did you lock all your doors and windows?"
        <p></p>"You watched me do it, didn't you?"
        <p></p>In the hallway in front of their apartments, Mahiru
        <p></p>reminded Amane as if she was his teacher or something, and
        <p></p>he answered with a small, wry smile.
        <p></p>Normally she wouldn't go out of her way to say something
        <p></p>like that, but she seemed to be worried, since their places
        <p></p>would be vacant for a while.
        <p></p>They were leaving that day to go back to Amane's family
        <p></p>home for about two weeks, and Mahiru was making sure
        <p></p>that nothing would happen while they were away.
        <p></p>"I did see you do it, but I'm asking just in case."
        <p></p>"Okay, okay. My turn—you didn't forget anything, did
        <p></p>you?"
        <p></p>"I didn't. We already sent everything we needed ahead of
        <p></p>time, and I checked my handbag again early this morning.
        <p></p>Everything is locked up tight, and I took out the garbage
        <p></p>from your place, and then I went over the contents of the
        <p></p>fridge, so you can rest easy."
        <p></p>"Thanks for going to all that trouble."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Naturally, there was no way they could carry everything
        <p></p>they needed for two weeks with them, so she had employed a
        <p></p>parcel service so nothing would go overlooked. On top of
        <p></p>that, Mahiru had taken care of everything at Amane's
        <p></p>apartment. He was no match for her.
        <p></p>Feeling grateful that she paid attention to such details,
        <p></p>Amane took Mahiru's bag from her and replaced it with his
        <p></p>hand.
        <p></p>After blinking several times, Mahiru said quietly and
        <p></p>bashfully, "That's one thing I like about you, Amane," and
        <p></p>squeezed his hand.
        <p></p>Amane's family home was located a little more than an
        <p></p>hour's distance away by bullet train from where he and
        <p></p>Mahiru lived in the city.
        <p></p>The two of them sat down in their reserved seats and
        <p></p>amused themselves by chatting and enjoying the scenery,
        <p></p>and in no time the train was pulling into Amane's
        <p></p>hometown.
        <p></p>It had been about a year since he had seen that station,
        <p></p>but it felt longer, and an inexpressible wave of nostalgia
        <p></p>came over him as he pulled Mahiru along by the hand to the
        <p></p>rendezvous spot.
        <p></p>"So this is your hometown."
        <p></p>"Mm-hmm. Well, that's not exactly right, since you can't
        <p></p>get to my house without changing trains or going a little
        <p></p>farther by car."
        <p></p>The bullet train only stopped at major stations, so they'd
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>had to get off here, but it would actually take a little more
        <p></p>time to get to where they were going.
        <p></p>This time, his mother had been available, so she had
        <p></p>offered to come meet them, and they had taken her up on it.
        <p></p>Her offer was probably motivated by the desire to see
        <p></p>Mahiru as soon as possible.
        <p></p>Walking toward the large pillar near the ticket gates that
        <p></p>was often used as a meetup spot, Amane spotted his mother,
        <p></p>even at a distance.
        <p></p>Naturally, Amane felt awkward about holding hands in
        <p></p>front of his mother, so he let go of Mahiru's hand. He sensed
        <p></p>a slight air of dejection coming from her, so he patted her
        <p></p>back lightly.
        <p></p>Forgive me just this once, since we haven't told her we're
        <p></p>dating yet.
        <p></p>It had become routine for them to hold hands, so he was
        <p></p>likely to take her hand without thinking about it, which he
        <p></p>would need to be more careful of while they were visiting.
        <p></p>Even Mahiru, who was a little reluctant to let go, seemed
        <p></p>to understand once she spotted Shihoko and regained her
        <p></p>usual expression.
        <p></p>Once Amane's mother saw the two of them, she put on a
        <p></p>charming, cheerful smile as they approached.
        <p></p>"So nice to see you again."
        <p></p>"Welcome, welcome, Mahiru dear! I'm so glad that you
        <p></p>came!"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane smiled wryly, thinking it was just like his mother
        <p></p>to greet Mahiru first.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed a little overwhelmed by Shihoko's energy,
        <p></p>but she gracefully bowed with a smile. "Thank you very
        <p></p>much for inviting me. And thank you for allowing me to join
        <p></p>you during your precious family time…"
        <p></p>"Never mind all that; we wanted to see you, Mahiru dear!
        <p></p>Actually, we wanted to see you over spring break, too, but it
        <p></p>didn't work out… Oh, Amane, what's wrong?"
        <p></p>"You're not going to greet your son?"
        <p></p>"Oh dear. Welcome home, Amane. Thank you for bringing
        <p></p>Mahiru."
        <p></p>"Yeah, sure."
        <p></p>He knew his mother was only teasing him, so he wasn't
        <p></p>particularly upset by it. When she noticed how brusque he
        <p></p>was, she pressed him further. "Oh, quit sulking, dear. Of
        <p></p>course I'm happy you've come back to visit, Amane!"
        <p></p>He couldn't help but be irritated by the way she smirked
        <p></p>at him.
        <p></p>Brushing off his mother's hand with a huff, Amane looked
        <p></p>around. He was surprised his father hadn't come to meet
        <p></p>them as well. Amane was sure he also had the day off from
        <p></p>work and had thought that both of them were coming.
        <p></p>"Where's Dad?"
        <p></p>"Your father's at home now fixing lunch."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Got it."
        <p></p>That made sense once she said it.
        <p></p>His father liked cooking and enjoyed hosting guests, so he
        <p></p>was getting everything ready at home.
        <p></p>"We're in luck, Mahiru; Dad's cooking is great," he told
        <p></p>her, swallowing his opinion that it wasn't as good as
        <p></p>Mahiru's, though.
        <p></p>Mahiru giggled softly. "So I've heard. I'm looking forward
        <p></p>to it."
        <p></p>"Oh-hoh-hoh. Please, come enjoy the tastes of our
        <p></p>homemade food."
        <p></p>"Look who's talking; it's not like you're the one doing the
        <p></p>cooking… Well, Dad is better at it anyway, so that's fine."
        <p></p>"Really, that was uncalled for."
        <p></p>Shihoko puffed out her cheeks in an immature expression.
        <p></p>But it was a fact that Shuuto was the better cook.
        <p></p>Amane's mother made the meals on weekdays while his
        <p></p>father cooked on the weekends, so even though Shihoko had
        <p></p>more chances to practice, his father's cooking always tasted
        <p></p>much better. That wasn't to say that Shihoko was an
        <p></p>especially bad cook, just that when it came to the issue of
        <p></p>seasoning, Shuuto's food was tastier. Of course, Amane was
        <p></p>grateful to them both for cooking.
        <p></p>"Well, that's fine; Amane being uncooperative is nothing
        <p></p>new. More importantly, should we head home? If we leave
        <p></p>now, I think we'll get there just in time for lunch. The car's
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>this way; come on."
        <p></p>Shihoko beckoned them toward the exit, saying the train
        <p></p>station was no place to be having a long conversation.
        <p></p>Amane looked at Mahiru for a moment.
        <p></p>"Ready to go?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>Mahiru gave a little nod, and he squeezed her wrist gently.
        <p></p>Naturally, he couldn't entwine his fingers with hers, but
        <p></p>by holding her wrist, he could play it off as making sure she
        <p></p>didn't get lost.
        <p></p>Mahiru opened her eyes wide, then leaned in a little bit
        <p></p>closer to him, wearing a happy but slightly bashful smile,
        <p></p>and Amane started walking slowly behind his mother, also
        <p></p>feeling a little shy.
        <p></p>They rode in the car for thirty minutes, bringing Amane
        <p></p>and Mahiru's travel time to about two hours, before they
        <p></p>arrived at the Fujimiya household.
        <p></p>A fairly large, detached house stood before their eyes. It
        <p></p>was a spacious home with a den, a big kitchen, and spare
        <p></p>rooms, and it must have been bigger than Mahiru was
        <p></p>expecting, because her eyes widened.
        <p></p>"It's huge!"
        <p></p>"Oh, thank you. We built it to have extra space. We really
        <p></p>wanted a daughter, too, so we included extra rooms, but we
        <p></p>can't get everything we want in life, can we? …You can come
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>live with us if you like!"
        <p></p>"Ah, um, I—"
        <p></p>"Mom, don't tease Mahiru; she doesn't know how to
        <p></p>answer."
        <p></p>"My, my."
        <p></p>His mother smiled brightly, but it seemed like she was
        <p></p>grinning at Mahiru's reaction.
        <p></p>Mahiru cast her eyes down in embarrassment, which he
        <p></p>knew would only feed his mother's happy delusions. As for
        <p></p>Amane's feelings on the matter, he hoped they would one
        <p></p>day be more than just fantasies, but of course he couldn't tell
        <p></p>his mother that.
        <p></p>"Come on, it's hot out here; let's hurry up and get inside."
        <p></p>"Yes, yes, you're no fun."
        <p></p>"What's that supposed to mean…?"
        <p></p>Amane herded his mother toward the house. He could tell
        <p></p>that it was hopeless. She was grinning with delight as she
        <p></p>unlocked the front door.
        <p></p>They heard footsteps from the interior. Amane's father
        <p></p>had noticed their arrival.
        <p></p>"Welcome home."
        <p></p>When they stepped inside the house, as expected, Shuuto
        <p></p>was waiting for them.
        <p></p>"I'm home, Shuuto. And I brought Mahiru!"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"It's nice to see you again, Shiina."
        <p></p>"It's been a while; I'm glad to see you're doing well."
        <p></p>It had been about half a year since Mahiru had last met
        <p></p>Amane's father, and as expected, she seemed nervous. His
        <p></p>mother acted frank, friendly, and too forward with Mahiru,
        <p></p>so they were probably on more familiar terms, but he figured
        <p></p>Mahiru still felt distant with his father.
        <p></p>Amane's father noticed Mahiru's slightly stiff demeanor,
        <p></p>and he put on an amiable smile. "Oh, you don't have to be
        <p></p>formal around an old man like me," he said.
        <p></p>"Oh no, I wasn't…"
        <p></p>"The problem is that you don't look like an old man, Dad."
        <p></p>"Oh, what a nice thing to say!"
        <p></p>It was true, Amane's father looked much younger than his
        <p></p>actual age. He had what they called a baby face. Nobody
        <p></p>could have ever guessed he was in his late thirties the first
        <p></p>time they met him.
        <p></p>"You're looking good yourself, Amane."
        <p></p>"Have I changed that much in just six months?"
        <p></p>"Mm-hmm. You look more manly—or like you've gained
        <p></p>some confidence. And you're filling out well."
        <p></p>Since he was traveling with Mahiru that day, Amane had
        <p></p>dressed up. But his father must have meant that Amane had
        <p></p>never been very confident in the past, and now that he was,
        <p></p>it made a big impression.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane felt slightly embarrassed that his dad could see
        <p></p>through him like that. He pressed his lips together, and his
        <p></p>father chuckled quietly.
        <p></p>"Well, Shihoko dear, can I leave it up to you to show them
        <p></p>around? I still have some refreshments to prepare."
        <p></p>"Sure! Come on in, kids. The house isn't much, but make
        <p></p>yourself at home, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"No, not at all… Thank you for your hospitality."
        <p></p>Mahiru bowed sincerely and took off her shoes before
        <p></p>stepping up into the house. Amane also removed his and
        <p></p>wore house slippers.
        <p></p>He didn't need a tour of his own childhood home, but
        <p></p>Amane intended to go along and stand guard so his mother
        <p></p>wouldn't tell Mahiru things he'd prefer she not know.
        <p></p>Shihoko watched Shuuto go back into the dining room,
        <p></p>then beckoned the two of them toward the stairs. "This
        <p></p>way!"
        <p></p>Most of the bedrooms and the guest room were on the
        <p></p>second floor, so it seemed like she was going to show them
        <p></p>that first.
        <p></p>Amane had planned to go to his own room and take a
        <p></p>peek inside the bag he had shipped ahead, but he thought
        <p></p>about it for a second and remembered where the guest room
        <p></p>was. An uneasy expression crossed his face.
        <p></p>…When I looked last year, there was only one other room
        <p></p>that hadn't been turned into storage space.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>That room, with a balcony that connected to his, had
        <p></p>apparently been built to use when his parents had another
        <p></p>child. In the end, the family hadn't been blessed with
        <p></p>another one, so it had gone unused, but the interior had
        <p></p>been finished and set up so people could stay there.
        <p></p>They rarely visited anymore, but when Amane's cousins
        <p></p>had come to spend long holidays with his family, that was
        <p></p>the space they had used.
        <p></p>Not that he and Mahiru were going to do anything, but his
        <p></p>stomach hurt a little as he wondered whether it was okay for
        <p></p>members of the opposite sex to stay in rooms that were so
        <p></p>directly connected.
        <p></p>"All right, Mahiru sweetie, you can use this room."
        <p></p>Just as Amane had suspected, his mother led them into
        <p></p>the room next to his, and he let out a soft sigh.
        <p></p>"Thank you so much for preparing a room for me."
        <p></p>"Don't mention it. The second-floor bathroom is over
        <p></p>there, and the room next to you is Amane's. Sorry, but the
        <p></p>balcony is connected."
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked in surprise when she heard that, then
        <p></p>averted her eyes awkwardly.
        <p></p>"I'll make sure to lock my side of the balcony, and you can
        <p></p>lock yours, too."
        <p></p>"I-I'm not worried about that."
        <p></p>"Just…please do it."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Oh-hoh, how precious." His mother laughed. "Well, I'm
        <p></p>going to help with lunch, so you two check your bags, okay?
        <p></p>We've already carried yours up to your room, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"Thank you so much."
        <p></p>"No problem. All right, see you in a bit."
        <p></p>Amane's mother smiled and went downstairs. He watched
        <p></p>until he couldn't see her back anymore, then let out a huge
        <p></p>sigh.
        <p></p>"Sorry, I think this was the only available room."
        <p></p>"N-no, it's fine!"
        <p></p>"It's fine because we're together, but if we weren't, it
        <p></p>would be awful, right? But I don't think my mom knows
        <p></p>about us… Geez."
        <p></p>"It's really okay. Besides, um… If the veranda connects,
        <p></p>we can look at the stars together," Mahiru said quietly with a
        <p></p>bashful look.
        <p></p>Amane smiled once he realized she wasn't worried about
        <p></p>him visiting her in bed, and when she mentioned spending
        <p></p>time together at night, happiness gradually welled up inside
        <p></p>him.
        <p></p>"…Well, we can meet on the balcony later if we get a
        <p></p>chance. Go ahead and get settled."
        <p></p>"Okay."
        <p></p>He wasn't sure whether Mahiru could tell that he was
        <p></p>trying to hide his embarrassment, but she giggled happily
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>and went into her assigned room.
        <p></p>It hit Amane again that they were going to spend two
        <p></p>weeks together in the same space, and he covered his face
        <p></p>with his hands as he stepped into his own room.
        <p></p>Lunch was like a welcome reception for Mahiru, and
        <p></p>Amane's father treated them to some of his home cooking.
        <p></p>Shuuto was the type of person who, like Mahiru, could
        <p></p>make all sorts of food, and apparently on Shihoko's request,
        <p></p>the day's main dish was paella.
        <p></p>Of course, there wasn't just paella; the table was also set
        <p></p>with bisque and salads loaded with seafood.
        <p></p>Naturally, everything was delicious, and Mahiru was
        <p></p>genuinely delighted. It seemed Shuuto had impressed her
        <p></p>with his culinary talents.
        <p></p>"Our son's not giving you any trouble, is he?"
        <p></p>A few moments after they had finished eating, Shuuto
        <p></p>began to talk to Mahiru.
        <p></p>Shihoko took care of cleanup, and they could hear her
        <p></p>washing dishes in the kitchen.
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked at the question and immediately shook
        <p></p>her head.
        <p></p>"Trouble…? No, nothing like that."
        <p></p>"You can be honest, if you feel like you're being forced to
        <p></p>take care of him."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…I've never disliked spending time with Amane or
        <p></p>considered it a burden. I always have a good time with him."
        <p></p>"Good to know."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't think of anything to say. His reply came
        <p></p>out more clipped than he intended.
        <p></p>"Don't be shy, Amane; you ought to thank her for what
        <p></p>she does."
        <p></p>"…I'm always grateful."
        <p></p>"Yes, I know."
        <p></p>Mahiru had picked up on him trying to hide his
        <p></p>embarrassment, and she laughed in her clear and beautiful
        <p></p>voice. That made him feel even more mortified, and in his
        <p></p>vexation, he repeatedly pressed and unpressed his lips,
        <p></p>which only made her giggle even more. It was hopeless.
        <p></p>He looked at Mahiru, ready to warn her that she would be
        <p></p>sorry for this, but all he could see was her charming smile,
        <p></p>and it was obvious that his words wouldn't do much good.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't stand it any longer and turned away. Even
        <p></p>his father began laughing at him.
        <p></p>"You just can't be honest, can you? Really. That is one of
        <p></p>the cute things about you, though, Amane."
        <p></p>"Why would you call a guy cute? Are you making fun of
        <p></p>me?"
        <p></p>"He's right; you are cute."
        <p></p>"Mahiru, we're going to have to talk about that later."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Okay. Let's talk later."
        <p></p>She answered cheerfully, and Amane was at a loss for
        <p></p>words. Mahiru was being more assertive than usual. He had
        <p></p>been worried that she might be feeling nervous, but she
        <p></p>seemed to have loosened up.
        <p></p>Simply by sharing this kind of exchange with Amane, she
        <p></p>was showing how familiar they were.
        <p></p>Amane's father watched their exchange with interest.
        <p></p>Suddenly, he blinked dramatically, as if he had just
        <p></p>remembered something important.
        <p></p>"Oh, right, Shiina, if you don't mind, would you go
        <p></p>shopping with me? Shihoko asked me to pick up a few
        <p></p>things."
        <p></p>"Why are you trying to take her with you?" Amane
        <p></p>objected emphatically.
        <p></p>His father continued smiling calmly. "Relax, it's not like
        <p></p>I'm going to drag her all over town chatting and giggling like
        <p></p>your mother, you know?"
        <p></p>"I know that, but—"
        <p></p>"Anyway, you can stay home and watch the house."
        <p></p>"What, why?!"
        <p></p>"Well, because I'm going to tell her about old times, and
        <p></p>it'll be a nuisance if the centerpiece of the story is there."
        <p></p>"Did you just call me a nuisance?!" Amane demanded.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"I did," his father smoothly confirmed.
        <p></p>Amane was again at a loss for words.
        <p></p>His father looked at Mahiru. "So you don't mind going on
        <p></p>an errand with an old man?"
        <p></p>"No, not at all. It would be my pleasure," Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"Great, I'll be glad to have you accompany me." He smiled
        <p></p>broadly. "While we're out, I want you to help me pick out a
        <p></p>present for Shihoko."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked bewildered. "P-present? Is today an
        <p></p>anniversary or something…?"
        <p></p>"Dad often buys Mom gifts, even on days that aren't
        <p></p>anything special."
        <p></p>Amane's father was a ladies' man who was extremely kind
        <p></p>to women—and especially to his beloved wife. He frequently
        <p></p>gave her gifts, even when there wasn't any kind of occasion.
        <p></p>He said that he did it out of gratitude for the things she
        <p></p>did every day, as proof of his love, and because he wanted to
        <p></p>see her happy face. Amane had also accompanied his father
        <p></p>on such shopping trips when he visited home.
        <p></p>His father had probably invited Mahiru so he could get
        <p></p>suggestions from a female perspective. But his main goal
        <p></p>was definitely to tell stories about Amane.
        <p></p>"…You're a lot like your father, Amane."
        <p></p>"I don't do as much as he does, though."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"You found me stuffed animals and cute little things and
        <p></p>bought them for me, didn't you?"
        <p></p>It was true he had bought gifts that he thought would
        <p></p>make Mahiru happy or look good on her, but he gave her
        <p></p>those things because of how he felt about her and as thanks
        <p></p>for looking after him on a daily basis.
        <p></p>Maybe that did mean he was like his father, but he didn't
        <p></p>think his efforts were as frequent.
        <p></p>"Well, I mean, you do help me out every day, so…"
        <p></p>"…Yeah, and that's my point?"
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed exasperated with Amane, who answered
        <p></p>by making excuses, and yet she laughed with a joyful,
        <p></p>humorous tone.
        <p></p>Amane's father also looked over at him with apparent
        <p></p>amusement, so Amane stumbled to his feet and made for the
        <p></p>kitchen where his mother was cleaning up the dishes,
        <p></p>running away under the pretense of going to help her.
        <p></p>"Oh, Amane? Wouldn't you rather be talking with
        <p></p>Mahiru?" Shihoko asked.
        <p></p>"Mahiru's planning to head out with Dad soon to do some
        <p></p>shopping."
        <p></p>Amane glanced back into the living room, where the two
        <p></p>of them were smiling and getting ready to leave.
        <p></p>They were moving quickly. Amane's father obviously
        <p></p>wanted to give Amane some space to cool off after he started
        <p></p>sulking. He was sometimes intimidated by his father's ability
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>to see right through to the inner workings of other people's
        <p></p>minds.
        <p></p>"Ah, they're going shopping, are they? And I think your
        <p></p>father has some things he wants to ask Mahiru, so this is
        <p></p>probably a good time."
        <p></p>"What is he planning to ask her…?"
        <p></p>"Just normal stuff, probably? It's not like I always know
        <p></p>what Shuuto's thinking."
        <p></p>Amane's mother handed him the paella pan after she had
        <p></p>washed it and put it on the burner to dry, so he obediently
        <p></p>returned it to the shelf where the cookware was stored.
        <p></p>While he was doing that, Mahiru and his father departed.
        <p></p>Amane gave a somewhat forlorn glance across the living
        <p></p>room, in the direction of the door they'd left through, and
        <p></p>then went back to help his mother finish washing up, drying
        <p></p>the clean dishes and putting them back on that same shelf.
        <p></p>It was work that he frequently helped Mahiru with, and
        <p></p>Amane was proud of how skillfully he handled the task. His
        <p></p>mother's eyes widened when she saw him.
        <p></p>"You've really mastered those movements, Amane."
        <p></p>"Thanks for noticing."
        <p></p>"I'm relieved to see that you're not just making Mahiru do
        <p></p>everything."
        <p></p>"What kind of worthless, awful guy did you think I
        <p></p>was…?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Of course, he wasn't the kind of shameless person who
        <p></p>would make Mahiru do all the work.
        <p></p>He would feel guilty, first and foremost, if he left
        <p></p>everything to her.
        <p></p>She handled the hard work of cooking for him, so Amane
        <p></p>figured he should help where he could and be sensitive to
        <p></p>her needs.
        <p></p>He looked pointedly at his mother, as if to say it was only
        <p></p>reasonable that he would help.
        <p></p>Still looking impressed, she addressed him again, "…Say,
        <p></p>Amane?"
        <p></p>"What is it?"
        <p></p>"How far have you gone with Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Pff?!" Amane sputtered. He had certainly not been
        <p></p>expecting that question.
        <p></p>His mother calmly finished washing a plate.
        <p></p>Without thinking, he took the clean plate and wiped the
        <p></p>water off it with a towel, but he couldn't hide his agitation
        <p></p>and furrowed his brow.
        <p></p>"Why are you so nervous? You're obviously dating; I can
        <p></p>feel it in the air. That's just like you—you can't hide
        <p></p>anything."
        <p></p>Once she said that, he couldn't deny it.
        <p></p>The atmosphere between Amane and Mahiru had
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>changed since their shrine visit at the start of the year. That
        <p></p>was only natural, since they'd begun dating, but he had
        <p></p>thought he was hiding it quite well from his parents.
        <p></p>Since his mother had seen right through him in the end,
        <p></p>that effort had been meaningless.
        <p></p>"…Is that a bad thing?"
        <p></p>"No? Actually I was hoping that she would one day visit as
        <p></p>our new daughter-in-law, so she's very welcome."
        <p></p>"…Really?"
        <p></p>"The way you were looking at each other, the air between
        <p></p>you two was so charged, I thought for sure you had already
        <p></p>gone all the way, though."
        <p></p>"Bah! No way!" Amane's eyebrows shot up at her
        <p></p>outrageous suspicion. "…Mom, you can't say stuff like that in
        <p></p>front of Mahiru."
        <p></p>But his mother didn't seem ashamed. "Of course I'm not
        <p></p>going to say that to sweet Mahiru. But personally, I do want
        <p></p>a daughter. I'm counting on you!"
        <p></p>Amane didn't blame her, since he understood her feelings
        <p></p>as a mother who wanted a daughter but hadn't been blessed
        <p></p>with one, so he just pursed his lips.
        <p></p>"…Just don't put any pressure on her."
        <p></p>"I know that. That's why I've got to get you to keep her
        <p></p>around."
        <p></p>"Do you really think I would let go of something I truly
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>want?"
        <p></p>In the past, he had thought that so long as Mahiru was
        <p></p>happy, he didn't care if he wasn't her partner and had been
        <p></p>prepared to let her go, but now he couldn't say that.
        <p></p>Maybe he had become petty, which was probably true, but
        <p></p>he could also say that his desire to cherish Mahiru and never
        <p></p>give her up had only grown stronger. He wanted to make her
        <p></p>happy—and make her fall for him so hard that she wouldn't
        <p></p>think about anyone else. He wanted to treasure her and keep
        <p></p>her to himself.
        <p></p>He wasn't going to let Mahiru slip between his fingers.
        <p></p>Shihoko was momentarily taken aback by Amane's
        <p></p>confident assertion, and then she chuckled cheerfully. "Haha, you're like your father in that regard, too, you know. He
        <p></p>loves me just as much today as he did long ago."
        <p></p>"I didn't inherit Dad's natural skill with the ladies,
        <p></p>though."
        <p></p>"I wonder? Shall we ask Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Hey, don't you dare."
        <p></p>If his mother asked something embarrassing like that,
        <p></p>Mahiru would probably have a fit, so Amane had to do
        <p></p>whatever it took to prevent that.
        <p></p>He glared at his mother to tell her to stop, but it didn't
        <p></p>seem to have any effect on her. Cheerfully, she said, "I can't
        <p></p>wait until Mahiru gets back," and Amane frowned again.
        <p></p>After several hours, Amane's father and Mahiru returned
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>when it was around time his mother said they should be
        <p></p>getting started on dinner preparations.
        <p></p>Amane had fled his mother's relentless teasing and
        <p></p>headed up to his room to unpack his bags and kill some time
        <p></p>with his school books. Mahiru came to see him right after
        <p></p>she returned.
        <p></p>Amane had taken most of his furniture with him to his
        <p></p>apartment, so there wasn't much to look at in his room, and
        <p></p>his mother cleaned it periodically, so he wasn't embarrassed
        <p></p>to show it to her. He invited her in casually, but she seemed
        <p></p>a little restless.
        <p></p>He couldn't tell whether that was because they were alone
        <p></p>together, or because they were in his room, or maybe
        <p></p>because of her outing with his father. But at any rate,
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem as if she would calm down soon, so he
        <p></p>put a cushion on the floor and motioned for her to sit down.
        <p></p>"Welcome back, Mahiru. Are you tired?" Amane asked as
        <p></p>he brought over barley tea for two and placed the cups on a
        <p></p>small folding table. After blinking several times, Mahiru
        <p></p>smiled.
        <p></p>"No, we were sitting the whole time we were traveling on
        <p></p>the way here, so moving my body was just what I needed."
        <p></p>"I see… So the reason you're fidgeting so much is because
        <p></p>of something you heard from my dad?"
        <p></p>Apparently he had hit the bull's-eye. Mahiru averted her
        <p></p>eyes nervously, and Amane sighed.
        <p></p>He wasn't upset with Mahiru, but there were several
        <p></p>things he would have liked to say to his father. However,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>there was no way to tell whether Shuuto would be vague and
        <p></p>evasive, or turn around and make fun of him, so he wasn't
        <p></p>going to say anything.
        <p></p>"Geez, my dad… What did he tell you?"
        <p></p>"It wasn't that big of a deal. He just asked how you were
        <p></p>doing and told me you were cute when you were a kid, stuff
        <p></p>like that."
        <p></p>"…What did you hear?"
        <p></p>As would be expected, Amane had only a vague
        <p></p>recollection of things he did in childhood, and he wasn't
        <p></p>even sure if there were things he would be embarrassed
        <p></p>about.
        <p></p>Nevertheless, if his father had gone out of his way to tell
        <p></p>Mahiru stories, that must have meant he had done
        <p></p>something memorable. He had probably told her stuff that,
        <p></p>from a parent's perspective, made for cute and funny
        <p></p>anecdotes, but from Amane's standpoint, stories of failure
        <p></p>from his childhood were embarrassing and no laughing
        <p></p>matter.
        <p></p>He narrowed his eyes and looked to Mahiru for details,
        <p></p>but she blatantly turned away.
        <p></p>"Th-that's, um… Well…"
        <p></p>"Why are you looking away?"
        <p></p>"The only thing I learned is that you're definitely cute."
        <p></p>Mahiru gave a reply that didn't answer anything, and
        <p></p>Amane let out a dramatic sigh.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Wh-what is it?"
        <p></p>"This is what happens to bad girls who won't answer
        <p></p>seriously."
        <p></p>Mahiru had been sitting off to the side, and he pulled her
        <p></p>toward him and made her sit between his legs. He embraced
        <p></p>her from behind, wrapping himself around her, and touched
        <p></p>Mahiru's belly.
        <p></p>She seemed surprised by this and twisted her body
        <p></p>around to look up at Amane.
        <p></p>"Ah, um, Amane?"
        <p></p>"You're pretty ticklish, right, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"…W-wait, please! Let's talk about this!"
        <p></p>"If you had fessed up in the first place, it wouldn't have
        <p></p>come to this."
        <p></p>He slowly moved his hands over her sides, following her
        <p></p>body over her clothes, and he clearly felt her squirm.
        <p></p>Feeling her slim figure, he ran his fingers slowly over the
        <p></p>smooth line of her waist and heard a small gasp.
        <p></p>Her reaction was so enticing that, against his better
        <p></p>judgment, he wiggled his fingers, gently grazing her skin and
        <p></p>tickling her again.
        <p></p>Seeing Mahiru squirm in his arms filled him with all sorts
        <p></p>of problematic feelings, but it was too late to stop.
        <p></p>"Ha, hey, wait…hee-hee, Amane…"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Wow, you really are ticklish, Mahiru."
        <p></p>He only touched her very gently, but Mahiru was
        <p></p>apparently very sensitive. She was clutching her knees to her
        <p></p>chest, trembling, and letting out little gasps of air.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't sure whether to think it was cute or be
        <p></p>shocked by how stubborn she was.
        <p></p>As he was tickling her softly, he made sure not to touch
        <p></p>any risky places. Perhaps unable to stand it any longer,
        <p></p>Mahiru suddenly turned her whole body around to face
        <p></p>Amane.
        <p></p>She glared at him with slightly flushed cheeks and eyes
        <p></p>teary from the tickling, and Amane's heart pounded for
        <p></p>several reasons.
        <p></p>"A-Amane, you dummy. That was mean."
        <p></p>"If you had told me everything right away, this never
        <p></p>would have happened."
        <p></p>"W-we really didn't talk about anything important. He
        <p></p>told me about when you had a head-on collision with a
        <p></p>utility pole when you were little and cried a lot, and how you
        <p></p>used to cling to your mom on Mother's Day and tell her you
        <p></p>loved her in baby talk, and how you once put wax in your
        <p></p>hair because you wanted to look cool like your dad and
        <p></p>ended up with hard, spiky hair. That kind of stuff, that's all."
        <p></p>"Those are the worst kind of stories!"
        <p></p>When he learned that Mahiru had heard about such
        <p></p>embarrassing incidents that he didn't even remember,
        <p></p>Amane covered his face with his hands.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>He had figured that his parents would tell her stories from
        <p></p>his childhood, but he would have liked to know why they'd
        <p></p>decided to only share the embarrassing ones.
        <p></p>From his parents' perspective, those were probably just
        <p></p>charming anecdotes, but to Amane, they were part of a dark
        <p></p>past.
        <p></p>"I—I thought they were cute?"
        <p></p>"Don't compliment me. Forget those stories."
        <p></p>"…I refuse, since you tickled me."
        <p></p>Amane knew that the stories would probably have been
        <p></p>burned into her memories even if he hadn't done that, but
        <p></p>when he heard the slightly peevish tone behind her words,
        <p></p>he regretted that he might have pushed things too far and
        <p></p>wrapped his arms gently around Mahiru from behind.
        <p></p>"Okay, okay, I'm sorry."
        <p></p>"…Next time you tickle me, I'm going to whisper all the
        <p></p>stories I heard right into your ear, Amane."
        <p></p>"Hold off on the psychological warfare… I get it, I get it.
        <p></p>Sorry."
        <p></p>He hugged her and stroked her hair to calm her down,
        <p></p>and Mahiru settled docilely into Amane's arms and buried
        <p></p>her face in his collar.
        <p></p>"Mahiru dear, go and have your bath."
        <p></p>They were sitting around after dinner, and it was getting
        <p></p>about time for everyone to take a bath, when Shihoko turned
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>to Mahiru, who was sitting beside Amane watching the
        <p></p>television.
        <p></p>"I can go after…"
        <p></p>"You're our guest, so don't hold back, okay? If you don't
        <p></p>want to get in alone, we'll lend you Amane for a bit."
        <p></p>"What a stupid thing to say, Mom." Amane's eyebrow
        <p></p>furrowed when his mother made an outrageous suggestion
        <p></p>with a broad grin.
        <p></p>When she said she would lend her son, she was suggesting
        <p></p>Amane should get in the bathtub with Mahiru, something
        <p></p>that Mahiru almost certainly would not consent to. Even
        <p></p>though they had splashed around in their swimsuits the
        <p></p>other day, getting fully nude together was still unthinkable.
        <p></p>Sure enough, Mahiru's face went bright red.
        <p></p>She glanced over at Amane, then flushed an even deeper
        <p></p>shade. She had definitely imagined seeing his body and
        <p></p>gotten even more embarrassed.
        <p></p>Amane knew he would also be writhing in shame if he
        <p></p>imagined anything in detail, so he did everything in his
        <p></p>power to not think too much.
        <p></p>"S-so we'd be, um, naked…"
        <p></p>"Oh, should I lay out an extra towel?"
        <p></p>"N-no, thank you…"
        <p></p>"Goodness, you don't need to be so embarrassed! Shuuto
        <p></p>and I bathe together all the time."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Th-that's…"
        <p></p>"Mahiru, don't take her too seriously. I mean, Mom and
        <p></p>Dad do get in the bath together a lot, but we don't have to do
        <p></p>that."
        <p></p>His mother had been joking around, but there was more
        <p></p>to it. Amane's parents were intimate with each other all the
        <p></p>time. If they went out walking together, they invariably held
        <p></p>hands and smiled at each other, and when it was time to
        <p></p>sleep, they both shared a bed. They were that consistent.
        <p></p>No matter how you looked at it, the two of them were
        <p></p>head over heels for each other, which was kind of
        <p></p>embarrassing for their son. But around town, they were
        <p></p>known as a couple of lovebirds. The two of them even took
        <p></p>their baths together. They believed that spending lots of time
        <p></p>with one another was important to maintaining a happy
        <p></p>marriage. Shihoko may have only been teasing, or she may
        <p></p>have honestly considered it their chance to get closer.
        <p></p>Either way, it's none of her business.
        <p></p>Amane was quite likely to dye the bathwater red with a
        <p></p>nosebleed if they got in together.
        <p></p>"You don't want to…? What's the matter with you young
        <p></p>people?"
        <p></p>"Whether we want to or not, do you think I could stand to
        <p></p>do that in my parents' home?"
        <p></p>"But I heard you were considering it at your apartment."
        <p></p>"…That's not up for discussion right now."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>He had realized what a convenient phrase that was the
        <p></p>other day at the pool when Mahiru had used it.
        <p></p>Amane could see that her eyes were darting around in
        <p></p>embarrassment, but in his heart, he couldn't say that he
        <p></p>didn't want to bathe together, so the best he could do was
        <p></p>dodge the question.
        <p></p>Honestly, he knew it would be incredibly awkward and
        <p></p>that the both of them would probably die of shame if they
        <p></p>tried. But at the same time, as a teenage boy, he couldn't
        <p></p>help but want to do it, just a little. He didn't think it would
        <p></p>happen, though.
        <p></p>Amane's father had been listening to the conversation
        <p></p>with amusement. He looked at Amane's stiff face and curled
        <p></p>his lips upward in somewhat of a wry smile.
        <p></p>"Shihoko dear, don't tease them too much."
        <p></p>"All right, fine," she relented.
        <p></p>Amane was immensely grateful for his father's
        <p></p>intervention.
        <p></p>"Go on, ignore my mom and go have your bath."
        <p></p>"O-okay. I'm going, then."
        <p></p>"You're such a cold fish, Amane. Have a good soak,
        <p></p>Mahiru dear."
        <p></p>Amane showed Mahiru to the bathroom to prevent
        <p></p>Shihoko from delaying her all night, then returned to the
        <p></p>living room.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>When Amane's father saw how exhausted he looked, he
        <p></p>chuckled and gave him a sympathetic smile.
        <p></p>Once Mahiru finished her bath, Amane's turn was next.
        <p></p>Knowing that his parents were going to get in together
        <p></p>and flirt happily in the tub, Amane had to take it before
        <p></p>them.
        <p></p>He felt his heart beat as he passed by Mahiru on his way
        <p></p>to the bathroom, and he quickly went to bathe.
        <p></p>He wasn't able to soak long because the thought that he
        <p></p>was sitting in the same water Mahiru had used kept popping
        <p></p>into his head, making him feel restless and dizzy.
        <p></p>Once Amane got out, his parents took their turn, so he
        <p></p>was left alone in the living room with Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Th-they're very intimate," Mahiru mumbled almost
        <p></p>unconsciously as she watched them go. Shuuto had his arm
        <p></p>around Shihoko's waist.
        <p></p>"They've been like that for as long as I can remember. I'm
        <p></p>used to it."
        <p></p>"…I think you have a great family."
        <p></p>"Thanks for saying so. Sometimes they give me heartburn,
        <p></p>though."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh."
        <p></p>Amane rubbed his chest and stuck out his tongue, and
        <p></p>Mahiru giggled quietly, covering her mouth.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Just asking, but are you going to be all right staying
        <p></p>here? You're not worn out or anything?"
        <p></p>"I'm fine. The two of them are being so nice to me… Like,
        <p></p>they're treating me as if I'm their real daughter…"
        <p></p>"Well, I guess it's because my parents always wanted one.
        <p></p>Now that such a cute, nice girl has shown up, they probably
        <p></p>want to dote on you."
        <p></p>"R-right."
        <p></p>Amane's parents had readily accepted Mahiru.
        <p></p>Of course, they were impressed with Mahiru's sweet
        <p></p>personality. Shihoko was practically smitten—and keen to
        <p></p>spend plenty of time with her.
        <p></p>Mahiru's cheeks were faintly red, maybe because she felt
        <p></p>bashful from being called cute.
        <p></p>"If you like, I don't mind letting my parents pamper you.
        <p></p>Ever since I left home, they have been starved for someone
        <p></p>to spoil. If there's anything you want, or any place you want
        <p></p>to go, just tell them, okay?"
        <p></p>His parents, especially his mother, seemed like they
        <p></p>would grant any wish Mahiru had with big smiles on their
        <p></p>faces.
        <p></p>"Y-you know I couldn't pester them like that… But—"
        <p></p>"But?"
        <p></p>"I—I would like it if we could all go out together… I've
        <p></p>always wanted to go on a big family outing…"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>At those final words, which she added in a truly fragile
        <p></p>voice that was barely louder than a whisper, Amane felt a
        <p></p>great pressure thumping in his chest.
        <p></p>He knew that Mahiru had a poor relationship with her
        <p></p>own family. Amane figured that, for Mahiru, being able to
        <p></p>develop a rapport with his parents allowed her to experience
        <p></p>something she never had with her family. He hoped she
        <p></p>would come to feel that way, but he knew it wasn't
        <p></p>something he could force. So instead, he decided not to
        <p></p>mention it—and just focused on treating Mahiru as if she
        <p></p>was part of his family.
        <p></p>"Is that so? Well, I'll tell Mom. Although I'm warning you,
        <p></p>if you don't have a particular place in mind, my mom will
        <p></p>probably pick whatever she wants. Some amusement park or
        <p></p>shopping mall, most likely. If there's somewhere you want to
        <p></p>go, you should ask, otherwise she might take us to some
        <p></p>weird places."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, as long as I'm going with you and your parents,
        <p></p>anywhere is fine."
        <p></p>"If you say that, my mom's going to take us someplace
        <p></p>strange…"
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled happily at Amane's words, and Amane felt
        <p></p>quietly relieved. Then he told her about some of the odd
        <p></p>destinations they had gone to in the past and coaxed even
        <p></p>more smiles out of her.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 66: Always by Your Side 
        <p></p>Whether it was due to exhaustion from traveling or from
        <p></p>dealing with his parents who were giving him a hard time,
        <p></p>Amane woke up late the next morning—if it could even be
        <p></p>called morning, since it was almost noon by the time he got
        <p></p>out of bed.
        <p></p>Amane picked up his terrycloth blanket from where it had
        <p></p>fallen onto the floor at some point in the night, and as he
        <p></p>began folding it, he let out one big yawn.
        <p></p>…I don't think we have any plans for today.
        <p></p>There was Mahiru's request for the four of them to go on
        <p></p>an outing together, but Amane hadn't told his parents about
        <p></p>that yet, as he had been planning to stay at home for the first
        <p></p>few days to rest. It was summer vacation, so he figured it
        <p></p>was all right to get up close to noon, though he couldn't help
        <p></p>feeling like he was being lazy.
        <p></p>Amane changed his clothes at a leisurely pace. Once he
        <p></p>finished dressing and made it down to the living room, he
        <p></p>saw that of course Mahiru had made it there before him. She
        <p></p>was sitting at the table with his mother and father.
        <p></p>Mahiru was peering down at some large object that
        <p></p>resembled a book, and what she saw was making her eyes
        <p></p>sparkle.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Good morning. Whatcha looking at?"
        <p></p>"Oh, good morning," Mahiru greeted him, without a shred
        <p></p>of sleepiness to be found in her expression. Then she
        <p></p>lowered her gaze to the book on the table again.
        <p></p>Amane looked down, too, curious as to what it could be,
        <p></p>then covered his face with his hand.
        <p></p>"…Wait a minute, why are you looking at a photo album
        <p></p>without me…?"
        <p></p>He saw a picture of a familiar, mud-caked little boy and
        <p></p>groaned.
        <p></p>Amane's parents were the type to take commemorative
        <p></p>photographs, and they treasured their memories, so it wasn't
        <p></p>surprising that they kept photo albums. The problem was
        <p></p>that they were showing one to Mahiru.
        <p></p>The pictures in the album, which was lying wide open,
        <p></p>were of Amane when he was young. It was filled with photos
        <p></p>of a charming and cherubic little boy, who was doing
        <p></p>something embarrassing in most of them.
        <p></p>Amane felt annoyed as he glared at his mother, who had
        <p></p>been showing Mahiru photographs of him covered in mud or
        <p></p>on the verge of tears with obvious delight.
        <p></p>"Oh, did you want to see your cute photos, too? You
        <p></p>should have said something earlier."
        <p></p>"No, I meant don't show her without my permission!"
        <p></p>"…Was it wrong of me to look?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"It's not, but…it's just embarrassing."
        <p></p>"But you're so adorable."
        <p></p>"That's not considered a compliment for a guy, you
        <p></p>know."
        <p></p>If she had called him cool or something, that would have
        <p></p>been better, but adorable was not what he wanted to hear.
        <p></p>Even though he knew she meant his childhood antics were
        <p></p>cute, he wasn't happy about it.
        <p></p>Amane turned away in a huff and could practically feel all
        <p></p>three of them smiling at him.
        <p></p>"Come on, it's fine, isn't it?" his mother prodded.
        <p></p>"Mahiru's clearly crazy about you!"
        <p></p>"I'm sure she just meant that the pictures were cute," he
        <p></p>scoffed.
        <p></p>"O-only because of how different you are now."
        <p></p>"Shiina here must really like you, Amane. As your father,
        <p></p>it makes me happy that you have such a levelheaded girl by
        <p></p>your side."
        <p></p>Out of the corner of his eye, Amane could see Mahiru
        <p></p>staring at the floor, hunched over. He figured that she must
        <p></p>be embarrassed by his parents' praise. However, he was
        <p></p>preoccupied with his own shame over the humiliating
        <p></p>photos his parents had shown off without his permission.
        <p></p>He flopped down onto the sofa in protest, and both of his
        <p></p>parents smiled at him.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Don't pout," his father said. "Isn't it true that you have a
        <p></p>great girl by your side who accepts you for who you are?"
        <p></p>"…That is true, but—"
        <p></p>"The one thing that makes us a little sad is that you didn't
        <p></p>tell us, though."
        <p></p>"Uh—"
        <p></p>Apparently, Shuuto knew that he and Mahiru were dating.
        <p></p>Maybe Shihoko had told him, or maybe he had heard it
        <p></p>directly from Mahiru herself.
        <p></p>"…I know you were probably embarrassed to tell us
        <p></p>everything, but—"
        <p></p>"Even so, we would have liked to know," his mother
        <p></p>interjected. "Although, we did guess."
        <p></p>"Well, as soon as Amane said he was bringing a girl home,
        <p></p>we knew, right? And you two are easy to read anyway."
        <p></p>"Oh, shut up!" Amane exclaimed. "So we're dating! Is that
        <p></p>so bad?"
        <p></p>"My, my, you really can't be honest about your feelings,"
        <p></p>his mother scolded. "Are you sure you want a guy like this,
        <p></p>Mahiru dear?"
        <p></p>"Well, Amane is a shy person…and I love him for it."
        <p></p>"I see; well, there you have it."
        <p></p>"I'm relieved you get along so well."
        <p></p>Amane already felt exhausted as his parents gave Mahiru
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>delighted looks, before turning their attention to him. He
        <p></p>couldn't even work up the spirit to respond.
        <p></p>…I'm in my own home, but I'm at a total disadvantage.
        <p></p>He knew how his parents were and had anticipated
        <p></p>something like this happening, but it was still almost
        <p></p>unbearable. They were being more welcoming and more
        <p></p>familiar with Mahiru than with their own son, and it made
        <p></p>him uncomfortable.
        <p></p>Amane sighed and, with a feeling of desperation, set the
        <p></p>album on his knees and started flipping through it.
        <p></p>The photos that Mahiru had been looking at so happily
        <p></p>were, as he expected, mostly records of embarrassing
        <p></p>moments. Some had been taken to commemorate special
        <p></p>occasions, but the majority showed him looking foolish.
        <p></p>He was disheartened to see that they also had pictures of
        <p></p>him wearing girls' clothes.
        <p></p>Amane had grown slowly, and until about halfway
        <p></p>through middle school, he'd had a very cherubic face, so as a
        <p></p>game, his mother had sometimes dressed him up in clothes
        <p></p>for girls.
        <p></p>In his second year of middle school, he had gotten
        <p></p>remarkably taller, and she hadn't been able to do that
        <p></p>anymore, but it was a bitter pill to swallow being called girly
        <p></p>face behind his back.
        <p></p>…This brings back memories…
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help but think of the boys who'd once
        <p></p>been his close friends before they'd had their falling out. He
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>had left his hometown specifically to get away from all that.
        <p></p>Now, for better or worse, he cut himself off from his past. He
        <p></p>had no intention of sinking in sentimentality. However, he
        <p></p>did think that there was a chance he might run into those
        <p></p>boys, since they had all gone to the local high school, and
        <p></p>that if he did, it was unlikely to go well.
        <p></p>Amane slammed the album shut to cut off the stream of
        <p></p>troublesome memories, and when he looked up, he saw
        <p></p>Mahiru staring at him.
        <p></p>"Ah, um, are you angry…?" she asked. She sounded
        <p></p>worried.
        <p></p>"Why would you think that? I was simply thinking that it
        <p></p>was nostalgic, that's all." Amane shrugged and placed the
        <p></p>album back on the table.
        <p></p>Amane was irritated by the way his parents had been
        <p></p>treating him, but more than that, he couldn't stand seeing
        <p></p>Mahiru upset. He gently extended a hand and patted her on
        <p></p>the head. Mahiru's eyes opened wide for a moment but
        <p></p>immediately softened as her face slackened into a pleasant
        <p></p>smile.
        <p></p>Shihoko gave them an approving look, but Amane ignored
        <p></p>her and gently stroked Mahiru's hair to soothe her
        <p></p>uneasiness.
        <p></p>By the third day of their visit, Mahiru was thoroughly
        <p></p>familiar with Amane's childhood home.
        <p></p>"Wow, Mahiru dear, you're really good!"
        <p></p>The three of them—Amane's parents and Mahiru—were in
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>the kitchen, wearing aprons, chummily making some kind of
        <p></p>sweet. Amane was not participating. He hadn't even been
        <p></p>invited, so all he could do was sit in the living room alone
        <p></p>and watch his girlfriend and his parents from a distance.
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru had traveled a long way to be there, so
        <p></p>Amane's parents were entertaining Mahiru at every
        <p></p>opportunity. They seemed to prefer her over their own son,
        <p></p>and the three of them seemed to be having a grand old time
        <p></p>together.
        <p></p>It wasn't that he didn't understand why his parents doted
        <p></p>on his girlfriend, since she was such a cute, honest, and nice
        <p></p>girl, but they were neglecting their only son.
        <p></p>He didn't particularly need them for anything, or want to
        <p></p>be bothered, but he still had mixed feelings about being
        <p></p>abandoned like that.
        <p></p>Of course, he was happy that Mahiru seemed to enjoy the
        <p></p>attention from his parents. He didn't mind sitting out a bit if
        <p></p>it meant that Mahiru, who had always yearned for a close
        <p></p>family, got to experience one, even if it wasn't hers.
        <p></p>The one thing that bothered him a little was that while his
        <p></p>parents were entertaining Mahiru, Amane hardly got to
        <p></p>spend any time with her.
        <p></p>I guess it's fine since we'll be together when we get back.
        <p></p>He knew that, once they returned to their apartments, he
        <p></p>would have plenty of time alone with Mahiru, but be that as
        <p></p>it may, Amane still felt a bit conflicted.
        <p></p>For the time being, Mahiru and his parents were
        <p></p>preoccupied with each other, so in order to escape his
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>discomfort, Amane left the living room and went back to his
        <p></p>bedroom.
        <p></p>He sat down cross-legged in front of a folding table and
        <p></p>opened up a book he had brought.
        <p></p>He didn't have anything to do, and he had taken almost
        <p></p>everything with him to his new place when he moved, so this
        <p></p>was the only way he had to pass the time. In any case, they
        <p></p>had tests coming up right after summer break, so he needed
        <p></p>to study to maintain his rank, and he liked studying anyway,
        <p></p>so it wasn't a pain.
        <p></p>Amane passed the time quietly, lost in his studies like a
        <p></p>good student.
        <p></p>Even though the workbook was new, thanks to his daily
        <p></p>efforts, he was able to solve the problems in it without much
        <p></p>trouble. His parents had always told him to study hard, and
        <p></p>more importantly, he had been working diligently to keep up
        <p></p>with Mahiru, so now he was seeing the results of those
        <p></p>efforts.
        <p></p>I'm sure it's lively down in the kitchen…, he thought
        <p></p>absentmindedly as he checked his answers, drawing red
        <p></p>circles on his paper. He had made a few careless mistakes
        <p></p>but was relieved to see his answers were mostly correct.
        <p></p>Amane still felt uncomfortable, despite the stillness of his
        <p></p>bedroom.
        <p></p>It's always been normal for me to spend time by myself.
        <p></p>Since when have I felt like something is missing without
        <p></p>someone by my side?
        <p></p>Without a doubt, it was because of Mahiru. He had gotten
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>used to having her around, so he now felt weirdly incomplete
        <p></p>when he was alone.
        <p></p>Idly spinning his red pen around and around in his hands,
        <p></p>Amane let out a small sigh. He would finish the workbook
        <p></p>soon, a thought that should have made him happy, but just
        <p></p>as he was about to exchange his red pen for a mechanical
        <p></p>pencil with a mournful grumble, the sound of three hard
        <p></p>knocks sounded from the bedroom door.
        <p></p>"Amane?" he heard Mahiru's reserved voice ask.
        <p></p>He had thought she was cooking down in the kitchen, but
        <p></p>when he glanced at the clock, he saw that two hours had
        <p></p>passed. They had probably finished already.
        <p></p>"What's up?"
        <p></p>"Nothing, just—you disappeared without us noticing,
        <p></p>so…"
        <p></p>"I was only studying. I had some time, so…"
        <p></p>He could hardly believe that two hours had gone by, but
        <p></p>that just showed how focused he had been. Actually, in a
        <p></p>way, he had been more distracted than focused since he'd
        <p></p>only started studying to drive other thoughts from his mind.
        <p></p>"…Is that so? Um, is it okay for me to come into your
        <p></p>room?"
        <p></p>"It's fine, but wouldn't you rather be talking to my
        <p></p>parents?"
        <p></p>"…Right now, I want to talk to you, Amane."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>She was probably concerned about him. If not, she
        <p></p>wouldn't have bothered to come visit him in his room. He
        <p></p>thought he was acting immature with his responses, but
        <p></p>there was no reason for him to turn her away, so he opened
        <p></p>the door and said, "Come on in."
        <p></p>On the other side stood Mahiru. She was holding a tray
        <p></p>and looking at him timidly.
        <p></p>On the tray were two café au laits and two cream puffs,
        <p></p>which was apparently what they had been making earlier.
        <p></p>"Pardon the intrusion…"
        <p></p>Mahiru entered hesitantly, making Amane feel a little
        <p></p>awkward, too.
        <p></p>He hurriedly cleared away his workbook and writing
        <p></p>implements, pulled out a cushion for Mahiru, then took the
        <p></p>tray from her and set it down on the folding table.
        <p></p>The beautifully baked cream puffs were magnificent to
        <p></p>behold, like something you would buy from a bakery. And
        <p></p>since Mahiru had made them, Amane knew they would be
        <p></p>delicious.
        <p></p>"We just finished making them. They're not that chilled,
        <p></p>but…"
        <p></p>"Mm, thanks."
        <p></p>He was full of gratitude that she had gone to the trouble of
        <p></p>bringing them up to him, so he said so honestly.
        <p></p>But for some reason, Mahiru cast her eyes downward
        <p></p>uneasily.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Amane, you're not mad…are you?"
        <p></p>"Why do you ask that?"
        <p></p>"Th-the air around you feels prickly. Like it's hard to get
        <p></p>close to you."
        <p></p>Apparently, she had picked up on the fact that he was
        <p></p>upset, although he wasn't actually mad, like she seemed to
        <p></p>think. Amane's feelings were very complicated, and he did
        <p></p>feel lonely. But he wasn't angry whatsoever. After all, there
        <p></p>was nothing wrong with what his parents or Mahiru were
        <p></p>doing, Amane was just in a funk all on his own.
        <p></p>"I'm really not mad at all. It's just—I was feeling lonely
        <p></p>because you got taken away," he admitted.
        <p></p>"Ah…well, that's…"
        <p></p>"Sorry. I know you're having fun spending time with my
        <p></p>mom and dad. I'm just being sulky. It's childish, even for
        <p></p>me." He laughed and shrugged, then took a sip of the café au
        <p></p>lait she had poured for him.
        <p></p>Amane knew that Mahiru was hungry for a loving family,
        <p></p>and he felt bad about leaving her alone earlier. He should
        <p></p>have been enjoying watching her, instead of worrying about
        <p></p>feeling out of place.
        <p></p>Amane was happy as long as Mahiru was happy, but it felt
        <p></p>sad to be left behind, and he was the one who had chosen to
        <p></p>isolate himself further. He had selfishly worked himself into
        <p></p>a bad mood, and he couldn't blame that on Mahiru or his
        <p></p>parents.
        <p></p>Amane set down his cup and sighed, and Mahiru slowly
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>looked up at him—then quickly launched herself at his chest.
        <p></p>To be more exact, she got close and leaned her body against
        <p></p>his chest, but Amane was caught off guard by the sudden
        <p></p>physical contact.
        <p></p>He wondered what was wrong all of a sudden, but for the
        <p></p>moment, he gently patted Mahiru's back to comfort her. She
        <p></p>slowly lifted her face and looked Amane directly in the eyes.
        <p></p>"…Of course I have fun spending time with your parents.
        <p></p>It does make me happy, but I need you to know that my
        <p></p>favorite thing is being with you, Amane," she whispered,
        <p></p>then brought her lips to his cheek nervously.
        <p></p>By the time he had registered the faint, soft pressure,
        <p></p>Mahiru had already pulled away.
        <p></p>When he saw her cheeks, suddenly redder than they had
        <p></p>been before, and her eyes welling with tears, Amane
        <p></p>instinctively planted his own kiss on her soft cheek.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>…I've been a fool.
        <p></p>He had been acting like a complete idiot, pouting for no
        <p></p>reason, when Mahiru had been so concerned about him.
        <p></p>He realized again how much he loved her, and he tried to
        <p></p>express his overflowing feelings with that action.
        <p></p>Even if it was just on the cheek, Amane wasn't used to
        <p></p>kissing yet. Mahiru was the same and shivered when
        <p></p>Amane's lips made contact.
        <p></p>At first, she seemed like she was going to run away out of
        <p></p>shame, but as Amane held her tight and touched her gently,
        <p></p>she gradually relaxed into his arms and closed her eyes in
        <p></p>comfort.
        <p></p>Mahiru bashfully kissed Amane's cheek in return, and
        <p></p>overcome by her cuteness, he squeezed her even tighter.
        <p></p>"…Hey, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>After they had kissed each other on the cheeks for a while,
        <p></p>Amane peered down into Mahiru's eyes. She looked back up
        <p></p>at him with an expression filled with both embarrassment
        <p></p>and joy.
        <p></p>"Listen, tomorrow, let's go out together. My parents have
        <p></p>work."
        <p></p>"Just the two of us?"
        <p></p>"I haven't shown you around my hometown yet, have I?
        <p></p>Though, it's not like there's much to see, not like where we
        <p></p>live."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>He had only suggested it because he wanted to spend time
        <p></p>with her, but Mahiru's eyes widened, then she put on an
        <p></p>even softer smile than when they had been kissing.
        <p></p>"Let's go… I'll go anywhere, as long as I'm with you."
        <p></p>"Uh—"
        <p></p>"But today, I want to stay here like this for a little while
        <p></p>longer… Your parents also told me I should spend some time
        <p></p>with you."
        <p></p>"It's none of their business…is what I'd like to say, but
        <p></p>they saw right through me. I guess I am bad at hiding my
        <p></p>feelings."
        <p></p>It seemed Amane's parents had been worried about him
        <p></p>as well.
        <p></p>Amane laughed at how needlessly foolish he had been as
        <p></p>he slowly pulled away from Mahiru.
        <p></p>She looked hurt for a moment, but then Amane pointed at
        <p></p>the cream puffs and whispered, "I want to eat the sweets
        <p></p>that you made," and she immediately cast her eyes down
        <p></p>bashfully.
        <p></p>"…Shall we eat them together?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>Instead of embracing, Amane sat by Mahiru's side,
        <p></p>holding her hand and smiling warmly.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 67: A Chance Meeting with the Past 
        <p></p>"The two of you are going out today, right?" Shihoko
        <p></p>inquired as the four of them took their seats at the breakfast
        <p></p>table.
        <p></p>Amane's parents looked very pleased, and Amane started
        <p></p>to regret telling them that he and Mahiru had made plans.
        <p></p>But his mother didn't mean to tease them. "I'm sure
        <p></p>you're bored being cooped up in the house," she added
        <p></p>quickly.
        <p></p>"Well, we're not really going anywhere in particular," he
        <p></p>replied, "just taking a little walk."
        <p></p>"We haven't gone anywhere yet, so I'm looking forward to
        <p></p>it," Mahiru added.
        <p></p>In the three days since they had arrived, Mahiru had gone
        <p></p>shopping with Amane's father on the first day, but aside
        <p></p>from that, they had passed the time at the house. Amane's
        <p></p>parents had been keeping Mahiru busy, and it wasn't like
        <p></p>she was going to wander aimlessly in an unfamiliar
        <p></p>neighborhood.
        <p></p>Amane had expected his parents to take them out to
        <p></p>places, but instead they had chosen to relax at home, so he
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>figured he would at least show Mahiru around town.
        <p></p>"There's really nothing around here except parks and a
        <p></p>supermarket, you know? It's a different story if we go into
        <p></p>town, though. Do you want to go?"
        <p></p>"No, taking a stroll with you sounds just fine. I'm happy
        <p></p>just walking together."
        <p></p>"…Is that so?"
        <p></p>He knew the answer. Mahiru didn't have any particular
        <p></p>place she wanted to visit—just going out and spending time
        <p></p>with Amane was enough for her. Her affection gradually
        <p></p>warmed Amane's chest. He could see by her expression that
        <p></p>she really was happy being with him, and he found himself
        <p></p>looking away out of embarrassment and joy.
        <p></p>"You know, they already seem like they're more than just
        <p></p>dating," his father remarked.
        <p></p>"We were like that when we were young, too, Shuuto," his
        <p></p>mother replied.
        <p></p>"No, you weren't as well-behaved as Shiina here."
        <p></p>"Oh, that's not nice!"
        <p></p>"But I thought you were cute just the way you were."
        <p></p>"Well!"
        <p></p>Shihoko blushed as Shuuto complimented her. Thinking
        <p></p>that it was too early to be listening to that kind of thing,
        <p></p>Amane focused on stuffing his face with the omelet his
        <p></p>mother had made for breakfast.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>It was tasty enough, but even so, he really did prefer
        <p></p>Mahiru's cooking—and not just because she was his
        <p></p>girlfriend. Now that he was accustomed to Mahiru's cooking,
        <p></p>he found his mother's food somewhat disappointing.
        <p></p>He looked over at Mahiru, thinking that he should ask her
        <p></p>to make breakfast some other day, and saw her looking at
        <p></p>his parents with a mixture of adoration, envy, and acute
        <p></p>bashfulness.
        <p></p>Amane knew what she must be thinking and began feeling
        <p></p>embarrassed, too.
        <p></p>…Of course, I don't think we could ever be as lovey-dovey
        <p></p>as those two…
        <p></p>Even so, he did think it would be nice if they could get
        <p></p>that close, to have what Mahiru was imagining. He did want
        <p></p>that, even though he couldn't admit it out loud yet.
        <p></p>Looking again at his parents, who had always been
        <p></p>affectionate toward one another, Amane imagined his own
        <p></p>future someday and blushed slightly.
        <p></p>"Well, should we get going?"
        <p></p>Shortly after his parents left for work, Amane turned to
        <p></p>Mahiru, who was sitting on the sofa.
        <p></p>It was still morning, and they weren't planning on walking
        <p></p>that far. They were just going to take a relaxed stroll around
        <p></p>the neighborhood, so he figured they would easily make it
        <p></p>back in time for lunch—Mahiru was planning to make
        <p></p>carbonara. They would return to the house by midday, so
        <p></p>they wouldn't be outside for that long.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Yep. I'm all ready."
        <p></p>"Well, there's not much to get ready for… We're planning
        <p></p>to go into town another time anyway, right?"
        <p></p>"…On a d-date?"
        <p></p>"Yeah. But today, we can take it easy."
        <p></p>Amane figured Mahiru would want plenty of time to get
        <p></p>ready for a real date. Today, they were just going on a simple
        <p></p>outing. Even if it met the strictest definition of a date, it
        <p></p>didn't feel like one for either of them.
        <p></p>A date was a special occasion, and Amane wanted to plan
        <p></p>a whole day together. This was simply a casual stroll.
        <p></p>Mahiru couldn't conceal her delight at the idea of going on
        <p></p>a date soon. She broke into a soft, euphoric smile.
        <p></p>"I'm looking forward to it."
        <p></p>"Mm. I still have to come up with a plan, so don't get too
        <p></p>excited yet."
        <p></p>"I told you, as long as I'm with you, anywhere is fine."
        <p></p>"I know that, but since we're going to the trouble, I think
        <p></p>it would be nice to go someplace that will make you happy."
        <p></p>Mahiru had told him that she was satisfied by just
        <p></p>spending time together, and Amane could see that in her
        <p></p>expression, too. Nevertheless, as her boyfriend, he wanted to
        <p></p>impress her.
        <p></p>"Well, that's a discussion for next week. For now, let's go
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>on a normal walk, shall we?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>Amane offered her his hand, and she accepted with a little
        <p></p>squeeze.
        <p></p>That made him feel nervous, and he smiled a little to hide
        <p></p>his embarrassment as they left the house, holding hands.
        <p></p>Even though Amane hadn't been home in about a year,
        <p></p>the area around his childhood home hadn't changed much,
        <p></p>and as he guided her down familiar streets, he began feeling
        <p></p>a little nostalgic.
        <p></p>They continued holding hands as they walked, and people
        <p></p>looked at Mahiru enviously as the young couple who looked
        <p></p>the part of students on vacation passed by. Amane found
        <p></p>this a little funny and laughed.
        <p></p>The stares alone were proof of what a beauty Mahiru was,
        <p></p>which was a good thing, but the number of people who
        <p></p>stopped to look was amusing.
        <p></p>"Why are you laughing?"
        <p></p>"Hmm? Because you're so beautiful. You're turning
        <p></p>heads."
        <p></p>"Well, I can't help it if other people fall for me."
        <p></p>"And what if I fall in love?"
        <p></p>"…I'll let you stare as much as you want," Mahiru teased,
        <p></p>smiling impishly.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Well then, I'll have to look to my heart's content once
        <p></p>we're home." Amane smiled, too, and pulled her by the hand
        <p></p>into a nearby park.
        <p></p>The park was relatively spacious, with lots of greenery, so
        <p></p>it was a place where people in the neighborhood came to
        <p></p>relax.
        <p></p>In the large sandpit, kids played in the sand, screeching in
        <p></p>their high-pitched voices, or took turns going down the slide
        <p></p>that was next to the jungle gym. Their parents watched them
        <p></p>from nearby benches and sometimes got up to play with
        <p></p>their children.
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru smiled a little at the very mundane,
        <p></p>yet charming, scene.
        <p></p>"They're all so lively," she said.
        <p></p>"They look that way because we're not as energetic. We
        <p></p>can't run around like that anymore."
        <p></p>"You never liked running anyway, did you, Amane?"
        <p></p>"No, I don't mind it. I just hate it when we have to run at a
        <p></p>particular pace, like in gym class."
        <p></p>Plenty of people disliked gym. Not all of them hated
        <p></p>exercise, they just didn't like being forced to do it in front of
        <p></p>others. Amane was like that. On his own, and moving at his
        <p></p>own pace, he actually enjoyed exercising. He just hated the
        <p></p>class.
        <p></p>"Hmm, maybe I'll go play with the children," Mahiru said.
        <p></p>"That might look weird, and you're not really dressed for
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>it. Besides… What am I supposed to do while you leave me
        <p></p>here?"
        <p></p>"You're right… But I think it looks kind of nice. I never got
        <p></p>to play like that when I was little, so…"
        <p></p>Mahiru added that she had mostly played alone in her
        <p></p>garden, and Amane squeezed her small hand again.
        <p></p>"…Still, maybe not right now, but, well, how do I put it? …
        <p></p>Someday, I hope we do have a chance to play here."
        <p></p>"Huh? O-okay…?"
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't really seem to understand what Amane
        <p></p>meant. But he didn't mind that she hadn't caught on to what
        <p></p>he was implying. He figured they had plenty of time to talk
        <p></p>about that sort of thing later, well after high school was over.
        <p></p>He didn't need to pressure Mahiru into thinking about a
        <p></p>future family—and anyway, he didn't think she would turn
        <p></p>him down.
        <p></p>Mahiru had tilted her head in confusion, so Amane smiled
        <p></p>and gently tugged at her hand. Staying in the shade as much
        <p></p>as possible, they slowly walked through the park relaxing
        <p></p>while gazing at the flowers blooming in the flowerbeds and
        <p></p>enjoying the refreshing breeze that blew through the gaps in
        <p></p>the trees.
        <p></p>Occasionally, one of the married women from the
        <p></p>neighborhood would greet him as she passed. "Oh, aren't
        <p></p>you the Fujimiya boy?" The women would smile and wish
        <p></p>him well. It wasn't unpleasant, but it was rather awkward.
        <p></p>The two of them ambled around for a long time and
        <p></p>eventually decided to take a break. They purchased drinks
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>from a vending machine and settled down on a bench in the
        <p></p>shade.
        <p></p>"Come to think of it, you're already totally used to my
        <p></p>parents' house, aren't you, Mahiru?" Amane asked after
        <p></p>taking a swig of his sports drink.
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked her caramel-colored eyes several times in
        <p></p>surprise at the abrupt change in topic, then her face softened
        <p></p>into a smile.
        <p></p>"Yes, I am, thanks to you all."
        <p></p>"Actually, you fit in better than I do."
        <p></p>"I—I do?"
        <p></p>"You do. Like it's already your home."
        <p></p>Mahiru blended in so well into the Fujimiya household
        <p></p>that it was almost like she had belonged there from the
        <p></p>beginning. Of course, Amane's parents were always
        <p></p>affectionate, but Mahiru seemed to receive special attention.
        <p></p>Even without Amane around, his parents doted on her so
        <p></p>much it was like she was already their favorite daughter.
        <p></p>Mahiru, for her part, seemed to be growing more
        <p></p>comfortable in their home.
        <p></p>"Are you enjoying your time at my house?" he asked.
        <p></p>"Yes. Heh-heh, it's really been nothing but fun since I
        <p></p>arrived at the Fujimiya household. Your parents have been
        <p></p>so kind to me."
        <p></p>"They're doting on you even more than I do."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Amane, you mustn't pout."
        <p></p>"I'm not pouting. Not while you're with me."
        <p></p>"…Okay."
        <p></p>Amane was glad to see that Mahiru was being welcomed
        <p></p>into his home, even if it did mean that he was somewhat
        <p></p>neglected. He was hopeful that eventually she might one day
        <p></p>become a permanent member of the family.
        <p></p>Amane was happy as long as Mahiru was with him, and
        <p></p>she had already shown him that she would always come back
        <p></p>to him. So he didn't have a problem with his parents
        <p></p>monopolizing her a bit. And he knew that once they returned
        <p></p>to their apartments, he would be able to have her all to
        <p></p>himself again.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed embarrassed by Amane's words, and she
        <p></p>pressed her forehead against his arm to hide her face. He
        <p></p>reached out to stroke her hair, thinking that she was so cute
        <p></p>when she did that.
        <p></p>"…Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>His hand stopped at the sound of someone's voice calling
        <p></p>out to him.
        <p></p>When he looked up, he noticed someone else nearby. He
        <p></p>had been so absorbed in his conversation with Mahiru that
        <p></p>he hadn't seen the other person approaching.
        <p></p>Oh, that's right, I knew there was a chance I would see
        <p></p>him if I came home.
        <p></p>The voice belonged to someone Amane had tried for the
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>longest time to forget, even avoiding him in his dreams. He
        <p></p>had left his hometown to get away from that person,
        <p></p>although he'd always known that they might run into each
        <p></p>other again someday.
        <p></p>In the recesses of his heart, Amane had been anticipating
        <p></p>their meeting.
        <p></p>This time, however, Mahiru was there beside him, and
        <p></p>Amane stayed calm and composed. He took a deep breath,
        <p></p>letting his hand fall, and turned to face the voice—to face a
        <p></p>boy who stood at the center of so many memories.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 68: Farewell to the Past 
        <p></p>"It really is you, Fujimiya! I didn't know who you were for
        <p></p>a second until I heard your name!" the boy who used to be
        <p></p>Amane's friend said.
        <p></p>Toujou, who Amane no longer considered a friend, stood
        <p></p>there staring at him. The last time Amane had seen Toujou's
        <p></p>face was at their middle school graduation, and his
        <p></p>appearance and attitude hadn't changed much since then.
        <p></p>On the other hand, Amane had changed a lot, on the
        <p></p>outside and inside, over the two years that had passed since
        <p></p>they had their falling out. And he had styled his hair and
        <p></p>dressed up for the day's outing, so he certainly ought to have
        <p></p>been difficult to recognize.
        <p></p>Ever since he had made his relationship with Mahiru
        <p></p>official, Amane had felt like anybody who had known him
        <p></p>before would scarcely believe that he was the same person.
        <p></p>There was nothing surprising about Toujou's reaction.
        <p></p>Toujou wore the same irreverent smile he always had.
        <p></p>Like Itsuki, he was a flashy, confident guy, but they didn't
        <p></p>have anything in common otherwise. Sure, Itsuki liked to
        <p></p>joke around, despite looking like a fresh-faced, agreeable
        <p></p>young man. But Toujou had a genuinely cruel sense of
        <p></p>humor.
        <p></p>At first, Toujou seemed a little uncomfortable with
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane's lack of response, but right away he broke into a
        <p></p>broad smile.
        <p></p>"It's been a long time, huh, Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"Yes, it has."
        <p></p>"You left home, didn't you? You're back now?"
        <p></p>"It's summer vacation, so I'm just visiting," Amane
        <p></p>answered smoothly. "Glad to see you're looking well."
        <p></p>He had been able to answer more steadily than he would
        <p></p>have expected, probably because he was surprised but not
        <p></p>shaken.
        <p></p>Amane had already prepared himself for this possibility.
        <p></p>His former friends still lived in their hometown, so of course
        <p></p>they would be around. It was pure chance that he had run
        <p></p>into one of them like this, but now that he did not live near
        <p></p>them, they were mere strangers with whom he had no real
        <p></p>connection.
        <p></p>There was one small twinge of resentment in his chest
        <p></p>when he thought of the past, but when he felt Mahiru's
        <p></p>warmth by his side, that unhappiness seemed to dissolve.
        <p></p>"So what's with the girl?" Toujou asked. "Don't tell me
        <p></p>you're out here picking up chicks?"
        <p></p>"Of course not; no way. This is my girlfriend."
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>Toujou gave Mahiru an appraising look. He didn't appear
        <p></p>too amused by the word girlfriend.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Toujou had an expression that Amane had seen
        <p></p>sometimes when they'd been friends. He knew what that
        <p></p>look meant right away.
        <p></p>It was the face Toujou made when someone else had
        <p></p>something that he didn't have.
        <p></p>"Aren't you all grown-up, with your girlfriend? The
        <p></p>crybaby with the cute face turned into a man after all, huh?"
        <p></p>Toujou smirked as he teased him, but Amane didn't think
        <p></p>much of it.
        <p></p>Amane had expected the words to hurt, but he didn't feel
        <p></p>a thing. It was like a gentle breeze had blown past, no force
        <p></p>behind it at all. Instead, he was more worried about whether
        <p></p>Mahiru was getting angry at Toujou's mockery.
        <p></p>He glanced over and saw Mahiru blinking.
        <p></p>Then she broke into a broad smile.
        <p></p>Mahiru's smiles came in several different varieties, but
        <p></p>despite their close relationship, Amane didn't recognize the
        <p></p>one she was wearing. It was different from the smile she had
        <p></p>worn when Amane had been belittled on Sports Day and
        <p></p>from the one she had used on the guys who had tried to pick
        <p></p>her up at the pool. The emotions behind this smile were
        <p></p>unreadable. Amane felt a little uneasy seeing it. He wasn't
        <p></p>sure if he should be relieved or worried.
        <p></p>Toujou, on the other hand, grinned with satisfaction.
        <p></p>"So, new girlfriend, did you know this? Amane's not too
        <p></p>bad-looking now, but years ago everyone used to tease him
        <p></p>for having a girly face until he cried."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>The malicious words didn't surprise Amane in the least.
        <p></p>"How very nostalgic," he muttered.
        <p></p>With Mahiru beside him, holding his hand, Amane
        <p></p>thought that, in the end, Toujou was just another ordinary
        <p></p>guy from his past.
        <p></p>Toujou had always been physically bigger than Amane,
        <p></p>and smart and cheerful, the kind of guy who always said
        <p></p>what was on his mind. And he'd always had lots of friends.
        <p></p>That made it much harder for Amane when Toujou, with his
        <p></p>many advantages, betrayed him and bad-mouthed Amane
        <p></p>behind his back. Amane had suffered terribly because of
        <p></p>Toujou's abuse.
        <p></p>Now his mind was calm. It wasn't that he didn't care, but
        <p></p>rather that he felt as if he had gained more perspective.
        <p></p>Things like that happened, and faced with it now, Amane did
        <p></p>not flinch or tremble like he had back then.
        <p></p>Toujou's cheeks reddened slightly, and his gaze grew
        <p></p>sharp. He seemed rattled by Amane's composed response.
        <p></p>"You seem awfully calm… Hey, girlfriend, what do you see
        <p></p>in a guy like this? His only redeeming feature is his family.
        <p></p>Do you know how uncool he used to look?"
        <p></p>Toujou switched his focus to Mahiru and started talking
        <p></p>to her, but she looked back at him with her unchanging
        <p></p>gentle smile.
        <p></p>"I've heard everything from Amane already. Although, I
        <p></p>didn't know that he had such a cute face and everything…"
        <p></p>"I didn't tell you because then you'd want to see the
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>photos."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, I've already seen them, though… And they were
        <p></p>adorable," Mahiru added in a quiet voice.
        <p></p>Amane shot her an exasperated look, and she responded
        <p></p>with an honest smile for just a moment before reverting to
        <p></p>her inscrutable angelic visage.
        <p></p>Amane smirked a little at Toujou, who was frozen in place
        <p></p>for a second by Mahiru's smile.
        <p></p>"I don't really care; you can say whatever you like. It's just
        <p></p>your perception. I'm not afraid of you anymore, and I'm
        <p></p>confident that my girlfriend's feelings aren't going to change
        <p></p>because of something bad you say about me."
        <p></p>Amane had nothing to fear from Toujou, because now he
        <p></p>had a loving and supportive partner. The past was behind
        <p></p>him, and it was nothing more than a healed wound.
        <p></p>He had the love of his life by his side and wasn't afraid of
        <p></p>anything.
        <p></p>"As far as I'm concerned, everything that happened back
        <p></p>then is over, Toujou."
        <p></p>So no matter what you say, it can't hurt me—that was the
        <p></p>meaning behind the look in his eyes as he stared at Toujou
        <p></p>calmly.
        <p></p>Toujou's eyes bulged as he appeared irritated by Amane's
        <p></p>placid demeanor. But before he could open his mouth,
        <p></p>Mahiru opened hers.
        <p></p>"…Come to think of it, you were asking what I see in him,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>weren't you?"
        <p></p>Mahiru stood up beside Amane, stretched to her full
        <p></p>height, and stared Toujou down. He winced ever so slightly
        <p></p>in the face of her captivating intensity.
        <p></p>Her eyes weren't cold so much as lacking in warmth, and
        <p></p>her calm, but keen, sharp gaze bored into Toujou.
        <p></p>"Do you choose who you associate with based on money?
        <p></p>Do you pick your friends by whether they have any value?
        <p></p>You'll never get a single thing you want by choosing like
        <p></p>that, and I doubt you'll ever be satisfied."
        <p></p>"Wha…?"
        <p></p>"I have money, but I've never truly been satisfied… I have
        <p></p>money, but my heart was always cold," Mahiru said quietly,
        <p></p>gently placing her hand over her heart.
        <p></p>Amane felt a tight pressure building in his chest.
        <p></p>As far as social standing, Mahiru was surely blessed. Her
        <p></p>household was wealthy enough to employ a housekeeper,
        <p></p>and everything she owned was high quality. She had told
        <p></p>him that the only thing her parents gave her was money. For
        <p></p>that reason, Mahiru didn't attach much importance to
        <p></p>wealth. Rather, she sought human warmth instead.
        <p></p>Toujou hadn't been able to hurt Amane, but he felt pain in
        <p></p>his chest when he thought about Mahiru's circumstances,
        <p></p>which showed how little Toujou mattered to him now.
        <p></p>"When I met Amane, my heart was filled with happiness
        <p></p>for the first time. So what I see in him doesn't have anything
        <p></p>to do with money or even looks. It's what's inside that
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>matters. I don't think anything else is important," Mahiru
        <p></p>asserted.
        <p></p>Without pitying or dismissing Toujou, she held his
        <p></p>reflection in her intently calm eyes. "If wealth is all that
        <p></p>matters to you, that's fine, I suppose," she continued. "I'm
        <p></p>not trying to deny other people's priorities in life. But to me,
        <p></p>Amane has more value than any other person, and as long as
        <p></p>he understands that, it's good enough for me."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Her angelic smile transformed into her true smile as she
        <p></p>looked at Amane.
        <p></p>That brought him great relief.
        <p></p>"That's plenty, Mahiru," Amane said.
        <p></p>"But—"
        <p></p>"No, listen, I'm getting really embarrassed from hearing
        <p></p>you say all that…but it does make me happy. You can tell me
        <p></p>all that stuff when we're alone together."
        <p></p>"…Okay."
        <p></p>If he'd let her, Mahiru would have probably moved on to
        <p></p>listing everything she liked about Amane. But her
        <p></p>enchanting smiles were wasted on Toujou, who was less
        <p></p>than a stranger to him now.
        <p></p>"Thank you," he whispered quietly as he stood up and
        <p></p>took a step to stand in front of Mahiru.
        <p></p>Facing Toujou now, everything that had happened before
        <p></p>seemed very distant. Years ago, Toujou had seemed so
        <p></p>dazzling and huge, he had looked so frightening, but Amane
        <p></p>had grown a lot, physically and mentally, and he wasn't
        <p></p>afraid of him anymore.
        <p></p>He didn't have to look up at him anymore, either. When
        <p></p>Amane straightened up and faced Toujou, he actually had to
        <p></p>look down a little. Amane didn't tremble in the least, even
        <p></p>with Toujou staring right at him.
        <p></p>"Toujou," Amane said his name quietly.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Wh-what is it?" came the flustered response.
        <p></p>…I really have gotten past it, huh?
        <p></p>Amane didn't feel anything looking at Toujou. He really
        <p></p>had let go of the past. Amane was calm, something he never
        <p></p>could have imagined when he left his hometown because he
        <p></p>feared confronting the other boy.
        <p></p>Behind him, Mahiru sensed Amane's mood and didn't try
        <p></p>to stop him.
        <p></p>I guess it's time to make a stand.
        <p></p>A stand against the past that I tried to ignore, and
        <p></p>against Toujou, the symbol of it all, and against the weak
        <p></p>version of me who was hurt back then.
        <p></p>In a certain sense, coming back home may have been
        <p></p>fate. It gave me the chance to put these things behind me.
        <p></p>Toujou looked flustered at Amane's cool demeanor. He
        <p></p>looked like he was wondering what Amane was going to say.
        <p></p>Seeing Toujou like that, Amane smiled a little.
        <p></p>"At this point, I feel kind of grateful to you. You used me
        <p></p>and afterward cut me off, but even so, I had some fun back
        <p></p>then, and I enjoyed your company."
        <p></p>Amane didn't have any intention of airing his grievances
        <p></p>to Toujou. In the past, he had been hurt and had suffered—
        <p></p>but he had learned, since then, to accept it as just another
        <p></p>kind of experience. One that had been a key part of his
        <p></p>development.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane liked who he was now. He'd met Mahiru and
        <p></p>started a wonderful relationship.
        <p></p>"So in the end, I'm glad I spent time with you guys.
        <p></p>Because of it, I was able to meet Mahiru. Actually, I think
        <p></p>you using me was good for both of us. You did hurt me, but I
        <p></p>think I probably became a bigger person because I was able
        <p></p>to overcome what happened. It was hard, but I found
        <p></p>something important, and it's all thanks to you guys."
        <p></p>In a certain sense, Toujou, and the rest of Amane's former
        <p></p>friends who were not present, had been major factors that
        <p></p>had led him to Mahiru.
        <p></p>And now they were no more and no less.
        <p></p>"Thank you… Now, I've got nothing more to do with you
        <p></p>and nothing else to talk about, so that's all I have to say."
        <p></p>His words of thanks were also words of parting.
        <p></p>Amane didn't have any desire or even a reason to get
        <p></p>involved with Toujou. Amane lived in another town and
        <p></p>went to another school. He was planning to go to university
        <p></p>there, too. Attending different schools, they would go on to
        <p></p>live in different places and learn different things. Toujou was
        <p></p>just someone he used to be friends with and was now a
        <p></p>stranger.
        <p></p>Toujou stiffened as if he had been hit by a bolt of lightning
        <p></p>when he heard these words coming straight from Amane's
        <p></p>heart.
        <p></p>Amane turned his back to him.
        <p></p>All the lingering discomfort he felt toward the other boy
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>had melted away.
        <p></p>"Well, Mahiru, shall we go?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>"Mm."
        <p></p>He took Mahiru's hand, feeling faintly embarrassed.
        <p></p>Mahiru had already lost any interest in Toujou and was
        <p></p>looking only at Amane.
        <p></p>Amane gave Mahiru a small, wry smile, and without
        <p></p>looking back, as if he did not care for the former friend who
        <p></p>was not yet far behind, they left the park together.
        <p></p>That evening, Amane closed his eyes in bed and waited for
        <p></p>sleep to find him. But as he lay there, he did not feel sleepy.
        <p></p>Amane usually never had trouble falling asleep, but that
        <p></p>night he couldn't even catch a moment's rest. He was
        <p></p>strangely alert.
        <p></p>He knew it was probably because of his encounter with
        <p></p>Toujou earlier in the day.
        <p></p>His former friend was one of the people who had caused
        <p></p>Amane a lot of heartache, but Amane no longer held even a
        <p></p>small fragment of ill feeling or uneasiness in his heart
        <p></p>toward those boys.
        <p></p>He felt refreshed after encountering Toujou and even a
        <p></p>little emotional over it.
        <p></p>Meeting Mahiru and spending time with her, earning her
        <p></p>trust and support, had helped him grow a lot. He felt
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>indescribably moved by it.
        <p></p>…I'm glad I got out of this town like Dad suggested.
        <p></p>If he had remained there, Amane would have never gotten
        <p></p>over his past and wouldn't have matured like he had. He
        <p></p>probably would have pretended not to see his pain and
        <p></p>would have lived his whole life trying to ignore it.
        <p></p>Everything was thanks to Mahiru, Itsuki, and the rest of
        <p></p>them. Gratitude toward his friends and the pleasant
        <p></p>realization that he had finally overcome his past filled
        <p></p>Amane's chest.
        <p></p>But it didn't seem like he was going to get any sleep. So
        <p></p>Amane decided to take in the outside air and got up, put on
        <p></p>his slippers, and went out onto the veranda.
        <p></p>The moment he opened the door, the hot, uncomfortably
        <p></p>humid air rushed into the air-conditioned room behind him.
        <p></p>It was nighttime, but the evenings had been sweltering for
        <p></p>several days in a row.
        <p></p>Even so, the sky was clear, and he could easily see the
        <p></p>stars now that he was away from the lights of the city. It was
        <p></p>the perfect setting to kill time and boredom until he got
        <p></p>sleepy.
        <p></p>While Amane was leaning against the railing, enjoying the
        <p></p>quiet atmosphere and the twinkling of the stars, there was a
        <p></p>sudden sound of a sliding door being opened.
        <p></p>It wasn't coming from his own room. When he turned
        <p></p>toward the noise that came from the other room connected
        <p></p>to the veranda, he saw Mahiru dressed in a long nightgown,
        <p></p>poking half her body out to look at him.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Mahiru, you're still awake?"
        <p></p>He had never expected her to still be up.
        <p></p>The night was late, and his family was fast asleep, plus
        <p></p>Mahiru had told him that she kept a regular schedule and
        <p></p>always went to sleep before midnight. It was surprising that
        <p></p>she was still up—and moreover that she would step out onto
        <p></p>the balcony.
        <p></p>"Somehow, I just couldn't sleep… What about you,
        <p></p>Amane? I guess you couldn't, either, huh?"
        <p></p>"Mm… There was a lot of stuff on my mind."
        <p></p>"…I guess so."
        <p></p>Mahiru was out on the veranda now, too, and she cast her
        <p></p>eyes slightly downward when she heard him say those
        <p></p>words, so Amane smiled wryly. "It's not that I'm not over
        <p></p>what happened, you know? I think it was just a lot for me to
        <p></p>come face-to-face with those strong feelings and realize how
        <p></p>much I've matured."
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't need to worry about that.
        <p></p>He wasn't thinking about Toujou anymore. He was just
        <p></p>appreciating how much he had changed. Toujou's face
        <p></p>hadn't so much as flitted through his mind. Amane wasn't
        <p></p>threatened by him anymore.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked relieved when Amane told her this with a
        <p></p>smile, and she put on a small one of her own.
        <p></p>"Heh-heh… You've become stronger, Amane, and grown
        <p></p>up, too. Not to mention, it sounds like you've gotten a lot
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>taller since middle school."
        <p></p>"Mm, I guess so. I've grown about twenty centimeters
        <p></p>since my first year of middle school."
        <p></p>"That's amazing."
        <p></p>"Yeah."
        <p></p>Amane had definitely changed. His height was one thing,
        <p></p>but in the past year, his mental state and his perspective on
        <p></p>everything had shifted, too.
        <p></p>Thinking about it now, he saw that in the past he had
        <p></p>been unsociable, cynical, and rude. His former friends
        <p></p>hadn't been entirely at fault, but it was still a fact that
        <p></p>Amane had not made it easy for anyone to get to know him.
        <p></p>He thought his current self was more composed than
        <p></p>before.
        <p></p>The reason for that composure was because of the beloved
        <p></p>girl by his side.
        <p></p>"It's like you said, Amane. You have matured. Mentally
        <p></p>and physically."
        <p></p>"…I guess I have."
        <p></p>"You're more confident now, right?"
        <p></p>"Yeah."
        <p></p>"That's good, then. Even if you lose your confidence, I'll
        <p></p>support you."
        <p></p>"I'm grateful for that, truly."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled gently and looked at the sky, placing her
        <p></p>hands on the railing beside him. Her loveliness threatened
        <p></p>to overwhelm him.
        <p></p>Mahiru nestled close to Amane and smiled. By his side,
        <p></p>she supported him. She encouraged him. This incredibly
        <p></p>lovely, precious person wanted to be with him.
        <p></p>"…Hey, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Yes?"
        <p></p>"…I want to touch you."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>Mahiru turned slowly toward him at these abrupt words.
        <p></p>She looked surprised, mostly, and Amane felt embarrassed,
        <p></p>but he didn't want to retract his request. He stared into
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes as she shook with bewilderment.
        <p></p>"…I feel like I want to touch you; is that bad?"
        <p></p>He very much wanted to.
        <p></p>He wanted to feel the warmth of this girl who loved him,
        <p></p>cared for him, and supported him. He wanted time to really
        <p></p>appreciate her being there with him.
        <p></p>Under Amane's direct stare, her caramel-colored eyes
        <p></p>wavered, then looked down in embarrassment.
        <p></p>"…It's not bad," she answered quietly.
        <p></p>Amane felt the warmth within his chest grow again.
        <p></p>As he was still taking in Mahiru's acceptance, Amane
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>extended a hand toward her.
        <p></p>But he was hesitant to embrace her there on the veranda,
        <p></p>so he just touched her palm.
        <p></p>As they walked together, Amane took her hand, which was
        <p></p>so delicate, yet had always encouraged him and guided him.
        <p></p>He led her into his room.
        <p></p>It was late at night, so he closed the door quietly, and
        <p></p>Mahiru sat down on the bed.
        <p></p>There was no sofa in the room, so the bed was the only
        <p></p>place for her to sit. But the moment she sat down, Mahiru's
        <p></p>body stiffened, and she looked at him awkwardly, which
        <p></p>made him smile in spite of himself.
        <p></p>"I'm not going to do anything," he assured her.
        <p></p>"O-okay."
        <p></p>"Were you expecting me to?"
        <p></p>"Th-that's not what I thought at all."
        <p></p>"In that case, I have some complicated feelings, as a man."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"Just joking… Right now, I just want to feel you, Mahiru."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked nervous for a second, but Amane wasn't
        <p></p>intending to do anything that she had to worry about. He
        <p></p>wanted her full consent—when she was ready to give it. He
        <p></p>would never force her into anything.
        <p></p>Mahiru finally relaxed, and Amane slowly wrapped his
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>arms around her. She returned the embrace, and his chest
        <p></p>steadily filled with indescribable euphoria from her softness
        <p></p>and familiar sweet smell. Feeling the love well up inside him
        <p></p>again, he squeezed Mahiru tight to have his fill of her.
        <p></p>In his arms, Mahiru closed her eyes pleasantly.
        <p></p>She didn't say out loud that she was happy, but a satisfied
        <p></p>smile crept across her face, and she seemed content, so
        <p></p>Amane was sure that Mahiru felt the same way he did.
        <p></p>…I love her so much…
        <p></p>Day by day, the feelings deep in his heart keep growing,
        <p></p>filling him with passion and joy from head to toe.
        <p></p>Even when he thought he couldn't possibly love Mahiru
        <p></p>any more, his feelings grew steadily stronger and more
        <p></p>ardent, and he knew they would probably never disappear.
        <p></p>Just like his parents, his feelings of love would only deepen.
        <p></p>His love would be gentle, elegant, and dazzling, and it could
        <p></p>transform into a deeper love that would never fade or
        <p></p>dissipate.
        <p></p>He loved her, truly from the bottom of his heart.
        <p></p>Filled with irrepressible emotion, Amane spontaneously
        <p></p>lifted Mahiru's chin and gave her beguiling lips a kiss.
        <p></p>He saw her caramel-colored eyes blink dramatically up
        <p></p>close. Then, the next moment, a dull pain hit his forehead.
        <p></p>He pulled his face away from the impact.
        <p></p>This time it was Amane's turn to blink, as he recoiled from
        <p></p>the steadily spreading pain. Mahiru, the probable source,
        <p></p>looked obviously bewildered, her eyes wavering unsteadily.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…Ow!"
        <p></p>"S-sorry! You surprised me."
        <p></p>"N-no, I'm the one who suddenly… I'm sorry."
        <p></p>He realized she had bumped into him in her surprise, and
        <p></p>he couldn't possibly blame her. He was the one who had
        <p></p>kissed her without her permission.
        <p></p>From Mahiru's reaction, Amane thought regretfully that
        <p></p>he ought to have held out a little bit longer. Her eyes darted
        <p></p>around the room, and she hunched over.
        <p></p>"I—I didn't dislike it, so…you just really startled me, is
        <p></p>all… Um… T-try once more, please. It'll be all right this
        <p></p>time."
        <p></p>Her shy voice trembled, but she squeezed her eyes shut
        <p></p>and turned her face upward, arranging herself into a posture
        <p></p>ready to accept a kiss. Amane smiled a little and obliged her.
        <p></p>With no bump on the head to drive him back, he took
        <p></p>advantage of the fact that Mahiru was accepting the kiss to
        <p></p>really savor it.
        <p></p>Her lips were softer and juicier than his own.
        <p></p>He was suddenly worried about whether his own lips were
        <p></p>dry and causing Mahiru any discomfort, but she didn't seem
        <p></p>displeased, not that he could see. She was shaking a little as
        <p></p>if he was tickling her as he nibbled at her softly, and he
        <p></p>found her indescribably precious.
        <p></p>He pulled away for a moment, but Mahiru was so cute,
        <p></p>and his desire to continue overruled his self-control, so he
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>pressed his lips against hers again.
        <p></p>He heard a muffled groan and couldn't tell if it was
        <p></p>conveying surprise or objection, but in an attempt to soothe
        <p></p>her, he gently caressed her lips, then settled into giving her
        <p></p>lots of little pecks.
        <p></p>Sometimes he garnished his kisses with small happy
        <p></p>sounds.
        <p></p>He narrowed his eyes, thinking how cute she was, and
        <p></p>gently kissed her repeatedly, holding her petite body in his
        <p></p>arms.
        <p></p>After tasting her lips again and again, he eventually did
        <p></p>pull away, and Mahiru buried her face in Amane's shoulder.
        <p></p>"…Y-you didn't ask me if you could do it so many times."
        <p></p>"D-did you hate it?"
        <p></p>"N-no. I just wasn't ready…and I'm embarrassed, is all…
        <p></p>It's my first time," she whispered quietly.
        <p></p>Amane heard another meaning in those words, and his
        <p></p>heart skipped a beat.
        <p></p>"…Amane, was that really your first kiss? You seemed
        <p></p>more confident than me."
        <p></p>"Not at all… I just—I wanted to kiss you so much I
        <p></p>couldn't stand it, so maybe I was a bit pushy…"
        <p></p>"N-no, it wasn't bad… I knew you were going to do it, so it
        <p></p>was fine… D-do it some more now," she said with her eyes
        <p></p>turned upward. Not even Amane was enough of a wimp to
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>refuse her.
        <p></p>Even as he kissed Mahiru again, he tried to match her
        <p></p>pace and forced himself to take it slow. He placed his palm
        <p></p>on the back of Mahiru's head, and she didn't pull away.
        <p></p>When Amane shifted to get a better angle to enjoy her soft
        <p></p>lips, he noticed his heart beating so hard it was practically
        <p></p>deafening.
        <p></p>"…Heh-heh." Mahiru laughed quietly in the interval
        <p></p>between kisses and placed her hand on Amane's chest.
        <p></p>Holding Amane at bay, she looked up at him. "…Before I fell
        <p></p>for you, Amane, I wondered what the point of kissing was.
        <p></p>But as someone who loves you from the bottom of my heart,
        <p></p>it makes me incredibly happy."
        <p></p>"…Are you happy now?"
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>"…Me too."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, then we agree."
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed embarrassed, but she put on a carefree
        <p></p>smile. He kissed her once more, and as he was tasting the
        <p></p>slight sweetness of her lips, he felt her body tremble slightly.
        <p></p>Worried he had made her uncomfortable, he backed away,
        <p></p>but Mahiru smiled awkwardly. "It's fine"—she drew her body
        <p></p>in closer to him—"you're nice and warm," she whispered.
        <p></p>"…Are you cold?"
        <p></p>"I guess I am; the timer on the air conditioner doesn't
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>seem to have cut off yet, so…"
        <p></p>The air-conditioning was actually set to a higher
        <p></p>temperature than it was during the day, but even so, the
        <p></p>room was fairly chilly. It would shut off eventually, several
        <p></p>hours after they went to sleep, but at the moment, Mahiru
        <p></p>must have been cold in her thin nightgown.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>After all, her arms were exposed in short sleeves. It was
        <p></p>no wonder she was freezing.
        <p></p>"If you like, maybe I could warm you up?"
        <p></p>"Oh, would you please?"
        <p></p>He had asked in jest, but Mahiru unexpectedly took him
        <p></p>up on the offer.
        <p></p>"What do you want me to do?"
        <p></p>"What do you think I want you to do?"
        <p></p>"I wonder, what could it be?"
        <p></p>"Take your best guess."
        <p></p>"…You're not gonna let me off easy, eh, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, not this time."
        <p></p>"Sure, sure. All right then, how about I do this, since that's
        <p></p>how you're going to be?"
        <p></p>Still holding Mahiru tight, Amane fell over onto the bed.
        <p></p>In his arms, flaxen hair fluttered down softly, and
        <p></p>caramel-colored eyes opened wide in surprise.
        <p></p>After kissing Mahiru's cheek again when she was frozen
        <p></p>stiff, Amane covered their bodies with the large terry cloth
        <p></p>blanket draped over the side of the bed. Finally seeming to
        <p></p>realize what had happened, Mahiru brought her face closer
        <p></p>to Amane's chest.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"This way, we'll both be warm."
        <p></p>"…Yes."
        <p></p>"I can also provide my arm as a pillow, as an optional
        <p></p>service."
        <p></p>He offered his arm to her, and with a small smile, Mahiru
        <p></p>hesitantly rested her head on it.
        <p></p>Seeing her face so close, Amane smiled. Then Mahiru's
        <p></p>smile transformed into something a little more impish.
        <p></p>"Now that I've taken you up on the optional service, is
        <p></p>there a cost?"
        <p></p>"A very special price, just for you, Mahiru. You've got to

        <p></p>"All right, I'm in."
        <p></p>"You're already tucked in, aren't you?"
        <p></p>The two of them laughed together, and Amane wrapped
        <p></p>his other free arm around Mahiru's back and closed his eyes,
        <p></p>embracing her.

        <p></p>Chapter 69: What’s Wrong with Liking What You Like? 
        <p></p>Of all the animals, the one Amane liked best was the cat.
        <p></p>He liked most animals, but cats were special.
        <p></p>He had memories of begging his parents to take him to zoos, aquariums,
        <p></p>and even farms when he was a young child, but ultimately, the creatures he
        <p></p>felt the most affection for were the neighborhood cats. He liked them so
        <p></p>much that he had always vaguely thought about getting one as a pet in the
        <p></p>future, when he lived alone.
        <p></p>Despite that, as he grew older, he stopped openly saying that he liked
        <p></p>cats.
        <p></p>Around the time he entered middle school, the house cat in his
        <p></p>neighborhood had reached the end of its life span, and he'd stopped seeing
        <p></p>it around. What's more, his classmates had made fun of him for liking cats,
        <p></p>so he had learned to keep it to himself.
        <p></p>And now that Amane was in high school, he lived in an apartment
        <p></p>building and rarely saw stray cats, so he never had the chance to play with
        <p></p>any. Instead, he satisfied himself with watching cat videos online every day.
        <p></p>One of the channels that Amane frequented put out a photo book, and
        <p></p>Amane went out of his way to order one the very day it was released.
        <p></p>Even though he had gone ahead and reserved a copy, the book was
        <p></p>going on sale close to the Christmas shopping season, and Amane was
        <p></p>worried sick that there would be some kind of strange problem at the
        <p></p>bookstore.
        <p></p>He had spent the whole school day restlessly fidgeting, slightly on edge,
        <p></p>and the only thing he had been able to think about was picking up the photo
        <p></p>book on the way home and giving it a good read.
        <p></p>"Welcome home. I'm sure it was chilly outside. Would you like
        <p></p>something warm to drink?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had gotten there before him. Amane froze.
        <p></p>Finding Mahiru in his apartment wasn't particularly strange in and of
        <p></p>itself.
        <p></p>On top of stopping in at the bookstore, Amane had been tasked with
        <p></p>buying the ingredients for that night's dinner at the supermarket, so he had
        <p></p>gone shopping. It made sense Mahiru got back first, assuming she went
        <p></p>straight home from school.
        <p></p>She came to greet him as if it was the most natural thing in the world,
        <p></p>and she blinked several times in surprise when she saw that Amane had
        <p></p>walked in with a pleasant look on his face.
        <p></p>"You've been in a good mood all day."
        <p></p>"Yeah, I guess."
        <p></p>He was much too embarrassed to tell her that he was in high spirits
        <p></p>because he had acquired the coveted cat photo book, so he gave her a
        <p></p>roundabout answer. Of course, that only seemed to make Mahiru even more
        <p></p>interested.
        <p></p>"…Did something happen?"
        <p></p>"Ah, n-no, not really… It's nothing."
        <p></p>"That's not a 'nothing' sort of face, though."
        <p></p>"Really, it's nothing."
        <p></p>Out of embarrassment, he looked away and tried to change the subject.
        <p></p>But apparently, that was even more suspicious, and Mahiru slowly
        <p></p>narrowed her caramel-colored eyes.
        <p></p>They had a general unspoken agreement not to meddle in each other's
        <p></p>private lives, but it would be a different matter if he had done something
        <p></p>inappropriate.
        <p></p>From Mahiru's perspective, it was easy to see that Amane was acting
        <p></p>suspiciously.
        <p></p>She stared at him intently.
        <p></p>His secret was nothing to feel guilty about, but it also wasn't something
        <p></p>he wanted to just come out and talk about, so now he had to worry about
        <p></p>her suspecting him of something more sinister.
        <p></p>His eyes darted around unconsciously, but that only made him seem
        <p></p>even more suspicious. Mahiru's gaze grew extra sharp.
        <p></p>When her eyes fell on the bag from the bookstore, Amane held out the
        <p></p>groceries, doing his best to distract her.
        <p></p>"It's really nothing; please don't worry about it. Would you put the
        <p></p>groceries in the fridge for me? There are frozen things in here."
        <p></p>"I can see that, but something seems off."
        <p></p>"Don't worry about it, please, I'm begging you," Amane said.
        <p></p>As he pushed the supermarket bag into Mahiru's hands, the bag
        <p></p>containing his book slipped off his wrist.
        <p></p>In a slight bit of good fortune, it happened after he had already handed
        <p></p>her the other bag, so no one was hurt, but—the photo book he had been
        <p></p>doing his best to hide fell to the floor with a loud thud.
        <p></p>If there had been a picture of a human on the cover, he might have still
        <p></p>been able to explain it away, but the cover was an extreme close-up shot of
        <p></p>a charming, round-eyed cat. Even as cute cat pictures went, this photo was
        <p></p>really over-the-top.
        <p></p>Silence fell over the room. A wave of despair crashed into Amane.
        <p></p>Mahiru was just as frozen as he was at this sudden development, but she
        <p></p>thawed out first and picked up the fallen photo book.
        <p></p>Amane braced himself for whatever she might say, but Mahiru just
        <p></p>smiled gently at the cute cat on the cover.
        <p></p>"Oh, how adorable!"
        <p></p>Then she lightly brushed the dust off the photo book and handed it to
        <p></p>Amane.
        <p></p>"By any chance, were you late because you went to buy this?"
        <p></p>"…Is that so bad?"
        <p></p>His voice was rather cold, mostly because of the incredible shame.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem put off by his brusque manner of speaking. She
        <p></p>simply wore a calm, pleasant expression.
        <p></p>"No, there's nothing wrong with that. I actually think it's wonderful. But
        <p></p>it was a little suspicious how hard you tried to hide it, even though there's
        <p></p>nothing to feel guilty about."
        <p></p>"I—I thought you would laugh at me."
        <p></p>"I'm upset that you worried I was the kind of person who would mock
        <p></p>someone for things they like. You know I wouldn't do something like that,
        <p></p>right?"
        <p></p>"I—I do, but…there are people who would smirk and tease me for liking
        <p></p>cats so much that I went out of my way to buy a photo book."
        <p></p>"It's not like it's immoral or anything, and it doesn't bother anyone else,
        <p></p>so why shouldn't you be free to like cats or buy photo books if you want?
        <p></p>Most people who scoff at other people's interests can probably find fault
        <p></p>with just about anything."
        <p></p>With these truly openhearted words, Mahiru soothed Amane's lingering
        <p></p>discomfort. For some reason, she looked relieved that there wasn't anything
        <p></p>else in the bag.
        <p></p>"You didn't have to worry about something like that, Amane. You were
        <p></p>being so sneaky, I thought for a moment that you bought something
        <p></p>indecent."
        <p></p>"There's no way!"
        <p></p>It was unavoidable that she would have such suspicions, especially when
        <p></p>a high school boy was obviously trying to hide something, so it was mostly
        <p></p>Amane's fault. He still felt a slight chill run down his spine at being falsely
        <p></p>suspected.
        <p></p>The bookshop wouldn't have sold me that stuff in my school uniform
        <p></p>anyway.
        <p></p>As that strangely logical argument crossed his mind, Mahiru said, "Well,
        <p></p>I did think that it wasn't likely since it's you, Amane."
        <p></p>She seemed to be understanding, so he decided to not share his retort.
        <p></p>"Let me make it clear that I would never buy anything like that… But
        <p></p>out of curiosity, supposing that I had, what then?"
        <p></p>"I would ask you what you were planning to do with stuff you're not
        <p></p>allowed to possess at your age. Not that I don't understand why you'd be
        <p></p>interested, but that's something you shouldn't touch until after you've
        <p></p>graduated high school."
        <p></p>"It's so like you not to say that it's obscene or dirty, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"Well, I might call you a pervert or something."
        <p></p>"I don't have anything like that, so relax already."
        <p></p>"Is that so? Well then, I'm not really sure what we're talking about."
        <p></p>Mahiru cut the conversation off disinterestedly.
        <p></p>Without meaning to, Amane smiled awkwardly. Whether or not he had
        <p></p>anything of the sort in his possession, that had nothing to do with Mahiru.
        <p></p>Neither of them meddled in each other's private life, and as long as they
        <p></p>didn't cause any trouble for the other, they were free to spend their time as
        <p></p>they liked.
        <p></p>I shouldn't have been so worried.
        <p></p>If he had acted normally, Mahiru wouldn't have paid any attention
        <p></p>whatsoever to the photo book. Amane had been the cause of his own
        <p></p>destruction.
        <p></p>Even though he still felt like an idiot, after what Mahiru had said, the
        <p></p>clouds hanging over his head cleared up just a little bit. He felt as though a
        <p></p>weight had lifted off his shoulders.
        <p></p>Whether she knew how Amane was feeling or not, Mahiru pointed at the
        <p></p>sink with an easygoing expression.
        <p></p>"Go on, wash your hands and come inside. Even if you want to look at
        <p></p>that photo book right away, first you need to do your coming-home
        <p></p>routine."
        <p></p>"I know, I know."
        <p></p>Amane made it a habit to wash his hands, gargle, and change his clothes
        <p></p>when he got home, and he was still planning on doing all that, so he
        <p></p>wondered why she had made a point of telling him… As he wondered,
        <p></p>Mahiru glanced away somewhat awkwardly.
        <p></p>"—Um…"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"…Could I look at it later?"
        <p></p>She didn't say what she wanted to look at, but he knew perfectly well, so
        <p></p>Amane didn't even try to hide his smile.
        <p></p>"Sure, I don't mind."
        <p></p>"Yay, I thought it was a supercute kitty."
        <p></p>"It sure is."
        <p></p>"Why do you sound so proud…?"
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed a little perplexed, but even so, she didn't make fun of
        <p></p>him. Instead, she smiled at him gently.
        <p></p>Feeling that gentle expression warm his heart, Amane headed to the
        <p></p>sink, somehow in a better mood than he had been in on his way home.

        <p></p>Chapter 70: Daily Routine and Meals Worth Remembering 
        <p></p>"…What are you writing?"
        <p></p>After dinner, Amane took care of the dishes. When he finished, he saw
        <p></p>that Mahiru was sitting on the sofa jotting down some kind of note.
        <p></p>Initially, he wondered whether it might be a school assignment, but that
        <p></p>didn't seem to be the case. It would have been rude to brazenly read the
        <p></p>contents, so he couldn't get a good look at it.
        <p></p>Glancing at it as he passed behind her, he saw what looked like a list of
        <p></p>dishes, written in neat letters.
        <p></p>Mahiru was used to Amane sitting beside her, and she didn't react to
        <p></p>him taking the adjacent seat. She continued moving her pen in silence.
        <p></p>"It's the menu from last night's dinner. It's helpful later if I make a note
        <p></p>of what I cooked."
        <p></p>Her slightly delayed answer was quite matter-of-fact.
        <p></p>"As the person who does the cooking, I decided I ought to keep track of
        <p></p>these things."
        <p></p>"You're so meticulous."
        <p></p>"I'm just writing down what I made, so it's simple enough. I'm the kind
        <p></p>of person who will pretty much eat the same things all the time, but that's
        <p></p>not so great as far as nutritional balance."
        <p></p>When it came down to it, Amane was also the type who would be
        <p></p>perfectly fine with eating the same thing over and over. But there was
        <p></p>nothing better than getting to eat a variety of dishes.
        <p></p>Since Mahiru had a varied repertoire, she always tried to avoid repeating
        <p></p>the same dishes. At most, she used the previous day's leftovers, such as
        <p></p>curry or meat sauce, to make something new.
        <p></p>Without even having to think back on it, Amane knew that she had been
        <p></p>incorporating a good mix of vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, soy, and dairy into
        <p></p>their meals.
        <p></p>He was grateful when he thought about how much care she put into
        <p></p>these kinds of details, but on the other hand, he also felt bad about it.
        <p></p>"How do I put this? I'm really grateful for everything you do. You have
        <p></p>my respect."
        <p></p>"Stop that. I'm just doing this for my own satisfaction. It's easier to have
        <p></p>a record when I'm trying to manage our nutrition. Plus, if anything ever
        <p></p>happens, I'll be able to check whether there was anything strange in what
        <p></p>we ate."
        <p></p>"I guess that's true, but it's still very thoughtful. Admirable, even."
        <p></p>"I'm not doing it because I want your praise, though. It's convenient to
        <p></p>have later, so I'm making a habit of it. That's all."
        <p></p>"Even so, I think it's impressive."
        <p></p>"…Well, thanks."
        <p></p>He really thought she was amazing. Without exaggeration, she was
        <p></p>terrific and so sincere.
        <p></p>"As someone who basically specializes in eating and can barely recall
        <p></p>the names of dishes, I find it incredible that you came up with an idea like
        <p></p>this."
        <p></p>"…Now that you mention it, for someone who specializes in eating, you
        <p></p>do know a fair number of dishes once they're laid out on a table. And you
        <p></p>have a good sense of taste, especially considering that before I started
        <p></p>cooking for you, all you seemed to eat was instant ramen and ready-made
        <p></p>food."
        <p></p>"At home, my parents…well, if I had to say, I guess it was my dad—my
        <p></p>dad made me try all sorts of things, so I got to eat lots of good stuff."
        <p></p>Amane knew that his palate wasn't necessarily dull just because he
        <p></p>didn't cook.
        <p></p>Just like how food critics aren't always expert cooks, it was possible to
        <p></p>hone his sense of taste, even though he couldn't prepare the dishes he was
        <p></p>tasting.
        <p></p>Amane's parents were good cooks, especially his father, and they were
        <p></p>the type of people who had regularly taken him to various restaurants. This
        <p></p>gave him plenty of opportunities to taste and compare a wide variety of
        <p></p>foods.
        <p></p>Thanks to their efforts, Amane had been raised with a fairly discerning
        <p></p>palate, which wasn't always a good thing.
        <p></p>"…I see. That makes sense. I had a similar experience."
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to understand without feeling any particular discomfort
        <p></p>about it, but her expression didn't brighten.
        <p></p>He was just guessing, but Amane figured that could be attributed to her
        <p></p>home environment.
        <p></p>He didn't know all the details about Mahiru's situation, and he couldn't
        <p></p>thoughtlessly butt in as an outsider, so he refrained from mentioning it any
        <p></p>further and instead turned his gaze back to the paper that her pen had been
        <p></p>running across until just a moment earlier.
        <p></p>"Can I take a look?"
        <p></p>"At this? I don't mind, but it's not particularly organized."
        <p></p>"I doubt that's true, but even if it isn't, I'd like to see it, if that's all
        <p></p>right."
        <p></p>Without hesitation, Mahiru granted Amane's request and handed him the
        <p></p>notebook.
        <p></p>After thanking her, he turned to the first page and saw detailed menus
        <p></p>inside, going back about three months and ordered by date. Everything was
        <p></p>written in Mahiru's tidy handwriting.
        <p></p>Her notes started on the day they had first eaten a meal together.
        <p></p>A nostalgic menu of miso soup, fish simmered in soy sauce, stewed
        <p></p>greens, and rolled omelets was listed there, and he let a smile slip out at the
        <p></p>vivid memory of it.
        <p></p>Amane flipped through the pages, musing that Mahiru's attitude toward
        <p></p>him had softened quite a bit since that first meal and reminiscing as he
        <p></p>revisited menu after menu.
        <p></p>Mahiru certainly incorporated all types of cooking, but looking at the
        <p></p>menus collected like this, he noticed there was a lot of Japanese food.
        <p></p>It was common knowledge that Amane loved eggs, so dishes that
        <p></p>incorporated them frequently showed up at their dinner table. He was
        <p></p>keenly aware that Mahiru had been paying close attention to his preferences
        <p></p>in more ways than one.
        <p></p>"Ah, these were sooo good."
        <p></p>As he was reading, Amane came across an entry for pouch eggs,
        <p></p>probably his second favorite egg dish of Mahiru's, after her rolled omelets.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed faintly pleased that he was excited but not at all
        <p></p>surprised.
        <p></p>This dish was made by closing up eggs in fried tofu skins and simmering
        <p></p>them in a sweet and salty broth, something that was not very difficult for
        <p></p>Mahiru to do.
        <p></p>"They don't take too much work to make. They are tasty, though, huh?"
        <p></p>she said softly.
        <p></p>Of course, Amane knew that anyone would probably be happy to hear
        <p></p>that something they had made was delicious, but all the food Mahiru made
        <p></p>was delicious, so it all came down to preference.
        <p></p>"…You really do love eggs, don't you?"
        <p></p>"The egg is magnificent. It's delicious whether you simmer it, bake it,
        <p></p>boil it, fry it, steam it, or smoke it, and it's chock-full of protein. I'd eat
        <p></p>eggs every day if I could."
        <p></p>"Sure, they've got good nutritional value, and I like to eat at least one a
        <p></p>day, but I find it hard to appreciate them quite as much as you do, Amane."
        <p></p>"Really? I just like them so much."
        <p></p>"…Do you want to eat some pouch eggs?"
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>Amane stiffened at the sudden proposal, but Mahiru retained her usual
        <p></p>calm expression. He hadn't meant to make a request, but apparently, his
        <p></p>impassioned declaration of love for eggs had given her ideas.
        <p></p>"I feel kinda bad."
        <p></p>"Don't. We're about to run out of eggs anyway, so I was just thinking
        <p></p>we should buy a new carton. Let's see… Tomorrow's menu is already set,
        <p></p>but I can change what I was planning for the day after. Nutrition won't be
        <p></p>an issue if I make a few extra side dishes, so it's an easy request to
        <p></p>fulfill…"
        <p></p>"Really?"
        <p></p>Without meaning to, he stared at Mahiru in joy.
        <p></p>For some reason, Mahiru cleared her throat after she noticed him staring.
        <p></p>Then she quietly answered, "…I don't mind."
        <p></p>Though it was low, Amane caught every word and let out a little "Yay!"
        <p></p>Then his cheeks naturally softened into a smile. "All right! I'm looking
        <p></p>forward to the day after tomorrow, then."
        <p></p>He was always excited for Mahiru's cooking, but hearing that she was
        <p></p>going to make one of his favorites only heightened his anticipation.
        <p></p>They had a hellish marathon scheduled in gym class that day, for reasons
        <p></p>he could not fathom, but Amane felt as if he could run his heart out as long
        <p></p>as Mahiru's cooking would be waiting for him afterward.
        <p></p>"…It's worth making if it will make you happy. Then again, you are the
        <p></p>type to tell me that everything is delicious, Amane."
        <p></p>"I say everything's delicious because it is. Everything you cook is great,
        <p></p>Mahiru."
        <p></p>"…Thank you very much."
        <p></p>"I enjoy eating every bite of food you make. You're always helping me
        <p></p>out, so thank you."
        <p></p>He thought he was telling her his honest feelings, so he was slightly
        <p></p>shocked when she blatantly avoided looking at him.
        <p></p>After fidgeting uncomfortably, Mahiru let out a quiet sigh. She seemed
        <p></p>tired somehow.
        <p></p>"You won't get anything by flattering me."
        <p></p>"I bet I'll get a delicious dinner."
        <p></p>"…That's one of the things I really like about you, you know."
        <p></p>"What is?"
        <p></p>"Everything."
        <p></p>Finally, Mahiru turned away. Amane was worried that he had said
        <p></p>something that hurt her feelings. Maybe because she could tell he was
        <p></p>flustered, Mahiru did not make eye contact with Amane for some time.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 71: Good Traits That Nobody Else Knows About 
        <p></p>This person is at a disadvantage because the good parts of him don't really
        <p></p>show through on the surface. This was a thought that Mahiru had about
        <p></p>Amane.
        <p></p>He had always had a sharp tongue, and that alone gave people the
        <p></p>impression that he was difficult to approach.
        <p></p>He wasn't foulmouthed in the sense that he said crude things or spat
        <p></p>abuse at people, but he did have a habit of being curt. Though anyone
        <p></p>listening carefully would quickly realize he never said anything out of line.
        <p></p>His looks weren't necessarily bad. If anything, he was rather handsome,
        <p></p>but he had long bangs and a tendency to look down; plus, he often had a
        <p></p>somewhat mean look in his eye that probably made it hard for people to get
        <p></p>close to him.
        <p></p>Even Mahiru would never have known his true nature without
        <p></p>circumstances giving her a push.
        <p></p>It's a waste in so many ways.
        <p></p>He's such a nice, considerate boy when you take a good look at what's
        <p></p>inside, but no one sees that.
        <p></p>With that thought, she looked over at Amane, who was quietly
        <p></p>completing his schoolwork beside her.
        <p></p>Amane wore an unfriendly expression on his face, but he was just calm
        <p></p>and composed, moving his mechanical pencil across the page wordlessly,
        <p></p>not appearing to notice Mahiru's gaze. He seemed to be really
        <p></p>concentrating. He didn't even glance at the coffee he had poured himself.
        <p></p>Mahiru picked up her mug, trying to make as little noise as possible, and
        <p></p>quietly sipped her coffee, which had gone cold.
        <p></p>Amane must have more or less figured out Mahiru's preferences, for
        <p></p>underneath the bitterness of the coffee was the taste of just enough sugar to
        <p></p>impart a faint sweetness, as well as creamer that made the drink mellower.
        <p></p>Amane had apparently listened to her grumble that she couldn't stand
        <p></p>intense, acidic coffee and had started keeping a different brand in his
        <p></p>apartment.
        <p></p>She had initially shot him a look that said This is your house, so you
        <p></p>should get the coffee you like, but with a look of feigned ignorance, he had
        <p></p>smiled and said, "This coffee is better, isn't it?" so she couldn't say
        <p></p>anything more on the matter.
        <p></p>Mahiru got a little worked up when she thought about how he was often
        <p></p>doing considerate things like that. She was about to take another sip of
        <p></p>coffee when Amane looked up.
        <p></p>"…Don't tell me it's bad?"
        <p></p>"No, not at all. I was just taking my time and appreciating how tasty it
        <p></p>is."
        <p></p>"Ah, okay, I'm glad you like it. Maybe I've gotten a little better at
        <p></p>making it?"
        <p></p>She saw the area around his eyes soften in relief, and Mahiru naturally
        <p></p>smiled as well.
        <p></p>"Well, that's because the last time you made it, you put in too much
        <p></p>coffee grounds and then added so much hot water into the filter that it
        <p></p>overflowed. I remember wondering why you poured it so vigorously."
        <p></p>"Oh, that was because my hand slipped. I haven't done that again since
        <p></p>then."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh. Failure is a stepping stone to success, so if you were able to
        <p></p>learn from your mistakes, then that spilled coffee paid off."
        <p></p>"…Don't tease me too much."
        <p></p>"I'm not teasing!" she insisted with a smile.
        <p></p>"That face says otherwise," he grumbled quietly, but he didn't complain
        <p></p>further, so he must have understood that Mahiru wasn't truly laughing at
        <p></p>him.
        <p></p>Amane pouted a little, which made him look a bit childish. Cute, even.
        <p></p>Mahiru mused that he would probably be more approachable if he made
        <p></p>such expressions more often, but somehow, she also didn't want him to
        <p></p>show that face to anyone else, and she didn't suggest it to Amane, either.
        <p></p>"…Are you taking a break, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Yes. I finished the assignment already, so I thought I would rest a short
        <p></p>while."
        <p></p>"Mm, in that case, I think I'll take a quick break, too. I'm tired of
        <p></p>working on this."
        <p></p>Amane threw his arms up and took a big stretch before gently rolling his
        <p></p>shoulders. Then he stood up and headed for the kitchen.
        <p></p>"I think I'm going to have a snack. Do you want anything in particular?"
        <p></p>He looked back at her after taking a peek in the snacks box, and Mahiru
        <p></p>answered, "I'll leave it up to you."
        <p></p>Basically, almost all the food in Amane's apartment was now stuff that
        <p></p>either of them could eat.
        <p></p>Of course, he had his name written on things that he wanted for himself,
        <p></p>but aside from those, it was all shared. Mahiru had heard that resentment
        <p></p>over food could be terrible, but neither of them was that attached to specific
        <p></p>things, so daily life had been peaceful.
        <p></p>They had set up a communal box for storing snacks, but since both of
        <p></p>them added things they were proud to have found or that they
        <p></p>recommended and wanted the other to eat, it was so full it actually never
        <p></p>ran out.
        <p></p>Amane added things that he guessed Mahiru had never eaten, as well as
        <p></p>any new products that went on sale, regardless of whether they were sweet
        <p></p>or salty, while Mahiru mostly contributed sweets. This was just a matter of
        <p></p>preference, and there were times when Mahiru also ate the salty snacks.
        <p></p>But lately, Amane had been casually buying baked treats that he thought
        <p></p>Mahiru would like, so it had become necessary to diligently check the bestbefore dates. As expected, purchases from a patisserie spoiled faster than
        <p></p>commercial products with lots of additives.
        <p></p>Amane had apparently gained a sense for that sort of thing since he
        <p></p>started living with Mahiru. He took the baked sweets that he had placed
        <p></p>near the front of the box and set them on a plate to bring over.
        <p></p>"I just grabbed the first ones, is that all right?"
        <p></p>"Thanks for bringing them over. I've got more time to spare, so I should
        <p></p>have gotten up to go get them."
        <p></p>"Don't worry about it; I was closer to the kitchen. Plus, it was my idea."
        <p></p>Amane returned to his seat with a little smile, so Mahiru stopped getting
        <p></p>up and sat back down, taking up Amane on his offer. She picked up a
        <p></p>cookie package and opened it.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't eat all that much, but she enjoyed tasty treats. She was
        <p></p>grateful that Amane considered her preferences when he bought the baked
        <p></p>sweets.
        <p></p>She took small bites of her cookie, being careful not to drop any crumbs,
        <p></p>and savored the rich flavor of butter that filled her mouth and the sweet
        <p></p>aroma that reached her nose.
        <p></p>And yet it wasn't greasy at all. Instead, it was light on the tongue, and
        <p></p>though she was very curious how much of this and that went into the recipe,
        <p></p>there was no way she would be able to tell, so she settled for devouring it
        <p></p>with relish.
        <p></p>Amane's judgment and sense of taste sure are reliable, she thought
        <p></p>without a hint of sarcasm as she munched on her cookie. For some reason,
        <p></p>Amane looked very amused as he watched her eat.
        <p></p>She knew he wasn't making fun of her, but for some reason, the soft
        <p></p>look in his eyes really bothered her.
        <p></p>"…What is it?" she asked, after swallowing every last bite.
        <p></p>Amane seemed hesitant, "Well, how should I put this…?"
        <p></p>"Was I doing something funny?"
        <p></p>"N-no, that's not it, but well…you're just cute, like a little animal."
        <p></p>"…Is that a compliment?"
        <p></p>"It was supposed to be."
        <p></p>She knew it was just his reaction to seeing how she ate, but Mahiru
        <p></p>couldn't help but turn away, feeling a mixture of embarrassment and
        <p></p>happiness.
        <p></p>…Sometimes, he's really bad for my heart.
        <p></p>Amane was fundamentally the kind of person who always told the truth.
        <p></p>On occasion, there were things that he wanted to hide or tried to explain
        <p></p>away, but he never told lies that would hurt someone.
        <p></p>He was quite an honest person, even though he didn't seem like it at
        <p></p>first, which made Mahiru all the more embarrassed by his comment. Her
        <p></p>eyes darted around the room.
        <p></p>Even though she was used to receiving compliments, this was what
        <p></p>happened to her whenever she got one from Amane.
        <p></p>Amane himself, possibly thanks to the way his father raised him, was
        <p></p>the type of person who always knew exactly what to say to make people
        <p></p>happy, so in a sense, he was trouble.
        <p></p>He paid attention to the smallest things, which was hard on her heart in
        <p></p>all sorts of little ways.
        <p></p>Recently, he had casually come out to meet her when he knew she
        <p></p>would be getting home late.
        <p></p>Even though it must have been a lot of trouble to change his hair so he
        <p></p>wouldn't be recognized, he didn't mind taking the time to get ready.
        <p></p>Whenever they walked together, he matched Mahiru's pace and
        <p></p>thoughtfully positioned himself between her and the road. If she had bags,
        <p></p>he smoothly took them from her, and if she was feeling unwell, he never
        <p></p>failed to notice immediately and always looked after her without a second
        <p></p>thought.
        <p></p>Amane was more sensitive to changes in her appearance than she
        <p></p>expected, and he often complimented her new hairstyle or clothing.
        <p></p>To add to that, once Mahiru started spending a lot of time at his place, he
        <p></p>moved the things she used often into lower spots where her arms could
        <p></p>reach. He had also acquired a small step stool, in case she needed to reach
        <p></p>anything higher up.
        <p></p>She felt grateful whenever Amane tried to address hardships that she had
        <p></p>hardly even realized were there. But Amane never said a thing about it and
        <p></p>acted as if it was all completely natural. Chances were good that he would
        <p></p>be a force to be reckoned with in the future.
        <p></p>Although she had initially thought that he was a helpless, foulmouthed,
        <p></p>sloppy, undisciplined person, once that slovenliness and curtness
        <p></p>disappeared, he turned out to have quite an admirable personality, and she
        <p></p>didn't even have to look that hard to find it.
        <p></p>Yes, Amane is a good neighbor, a good friend, and a good—
        <p></p>Her train of thought made it that far before she cut herself off and shook
        <p></p>her head, flustered.
        <p></p>"Is something wrong?" Amane asked with concern, seeming surprised
        <p></p>by her sudden movement.
        <p></p>Hoping to conceal the turmoil of her inner thoughts, Mahiru smiled a
        <p></p>little. "…Amane, I wonder why you're not more popular with girls?"
        <p></p>"Why does it feel like you're suddenly picking a fight with me…?"
        <p></p>This time, Mahiru was the one who had said something foolish. Without
        <p></p>him knowing what she had been thinking, it had probably sounded as if she
        <p></p>was making fun of him.
        <p></p>"Sorry, that's not what I was trying to say. I was just thinking that it's
        <p></p>strange how there aren't more people who want to be friends with you,
        <p></p>since you have such a nice personality."
        <p></p>"Even when you put it that way, I feel like I just had my unpopularity
        <p></p>thrust into the spotlight. That said, I've never had much to do with other
        <p></p>girls anyway, so I think I've got bigger problems than being unpopular…"
        <p></p>The only girl Amane regularly interacted with at school was Chitose.
        <p></p>The other people at school thought he was rather gloomy and not very cool.
        <p></p>It was clear that his good qualities were not at all apparent.
        <p></p>"Maybe it's because I never really wanted to be popular in the first
        <p></p>place."
        <p></p>"Is that how it is?"
        <p></p>"I don't know about other guys, but that's especially true for me since
        <p></p>I'm not looking for a girlfriend… As long as I eventually meet somebody I
        <p></p>want to spend my life with, I think it's fine that I'm not particularly popular
        <p></p>right now." He seemed to have trouble getting the words out and mumbled
        <p></p>them quietly, unable to hide his embarrassment.
        <p></p>Mahiru felt a gradual heat rising deep in her chest, and her mouth
        <p></p>softened into a smile.
        <p></p>"…Amane, you—"
        <p></p>"What? You want to call me a dreamer?"
        <p></p>"No, I think it's wonderful. You're a very devoted person."
        <p></p>"…Feels like I'm being teased again."
        <p></p>"Now, why would you think that? Geez…"
        <p></p>Mahiru really didn't know why Amane had interpreted her words that
        <p></p>way. She poked him in the side, and Amane frowned awkwardly before
        <p></p>turning away.
        <p></p>She thought she saw his mouth move slightly, but as for the words that
        <p></p>might have slipped out, she couldn't get him to tell her what they were, no
        <p></p>matter how many times she asked.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 72: Another Major Cleaning Operation, and Trouble 
        <p></p>Mahiru liked cleaning a fair bit.
        <p></p>Right after they had met, she had been kind enough to help Amane clean
        <p></p>his apartment, and she had completed the task extremely skillfully and
        <p></p>thoroughly.
        <p></p>Amane also tried his best to clean and maintain things, but once in a
        <p></p>while, Mahiru would check and point out places where he had been
        <p></p>careless.
        <p></p>Of course, she didn't nag him incessantly. It was more like explaining
        <p></p>ways to make dirt easier to remove or suggesting ways to make daily
        <p></p>maintenance easier, so Amane was always grateful for her input.
        <p></p>"I shouldn't be surprised you tend to overlook grime in places that get
        <p></p>wet. Looks like you've been cleaning the places you can see, but there's
        <p></p>some left around the back and in the corners. Basically all the places that
        <p></p>are hard to get a look at."
        <p></p>Mahiru peeked in suddenly while Amane was cleaning his bathtub and
        <p></p>immediately noticed a spot of grime he had missed.
        <p></p>She was wearing a little smirk, as if she had suspected as much.
        <p></p>Just as she'd pointed out, there were spots of black mold on the rubber
        <p></p>seal around the shower door and in the back of the shampoo shelf.
        <p></p>These places were hard to see, so he hadn't noticed the mold, but now
        <p></p>that Mahiru had pointed those spots out, they were going to bother him.
        <p></p>Amane had started paying attention to all sorts of things after cleaning
        <p></p>with Mahiru the year before, but of course, she made him realize that he
        <p></p>still had a long way to go.
        <p></p>"Bathrooms are humid even if you ventilate them, and it's easy for black
        <p></p>mold to crop up. Especially in corners and blind spots like this rubber seal.
        <p></p>This is what happens if you don't make a conscious effort to clean them."
        <p></p>"You're right."
        <p></p>"…I'm not scolding you, okay? I mean, if you just kept going and didn't
        <p></p>pay attention, this is exactly the kind of grime that ends up plaguing most
        <p></p>households."
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded earnestly and insisted that it was a common problem, but
        <p></p>when she noticed Amane scrunching his shoulders up, she smiled
        <p></p>awkwardly.
        <p></p>"Don't look so defeated. I think you've done a great job cleaning
        <p></p>everywhere else."
        <p></p>"Thanks for saying that, but…"
        <p></p>"You just have to pay attention to it from now on, so don't mope about
        <p></p>it. If you have time to feel bad about it, then you can take care of it right
        <p></p>away… Actually, would it be all right if I helped?"
        <p></p>Mahiru slapped her upper arms for emphasis, eager to put her skills to
        <p></p>use. For some reason, there was visible excitement in her eyes.
        <p></p>Either because she liked cleaning or because she was just a naturally
        <p></p>helpful person, it actually seemed more like Mahiru wanted to clean rather
        <p></p>than like she was resigned to it.
        <p></p>Amane knew that failing to pay attention to the details was one of his
        <p></p>weaknesses, so it helped to have her point things out, and her offer to help
        <p></p>clean did make him happy.
        <p></p>At the same time, he felt incredibly guilty about letting her do it.
        <p></p>"…Isn't that unpleasant for you, Mahiru? Cleaning someone else's
        <p></p>bathroom?"
        <p></p>"I don't really mind. But does it bother you? It's not an exaggeration to
        <p></p>say that this is your private space."
        <p></p>"I'm not particularly bothered by you seeing it. After all, you've used
        <p></p>my bathtub before. It's a little late to be embarrassed."
        <p></p>She had once forgotten her key at Chitose's house and spent the night in
        <p></p>Amane's apartment, and she had already used his bath on that occasion.
        <p></p>Plus, she often used the sink that was right outside the bathroom, giving her
        <p></p>a clear view of the interior.
        <p></p>In that sense, it was too late to feel bashful, but he was worried about
        <p></p>whether Mahiru was all right with entering the bathroom of a member of
        <p></p>the opposite sex.
        <p></p>"…Th-that's true, but—"
        <p></p>"I can't say anything self-important, since I'm the one getting the favor,
        <p></p>and I'll take you up on your offer, if you don't mind, but I can do it myself
        <p></p>if I need to. Though I will ask you to supervise."
        <p></p>He was grateful she was checking his work, since he was likely to
        <p></p>overlook spots of grime, but for some reason, Mahiru seemed ever so
        <p></p>slightly agitated and was letting her gaze drift around the room.
        <p></p>"…N-no, I'll do it, if that's all right. A bathroom is too cramped for the
        <p></p>two of us to clean together anyway."
        <p></p>"Really? I feel kinda bad making you spend a precious day off doing
        <p></p>this."
        <p></p>"No, it's fine. I like cleaning."
        <p></p>"In that case, I'll leave it to you. I've got no other plans, and you're
        <p></p>being so generous, so I think I'll go clean the kitchen. I want to try
        <p></p>polishing the sink."
        <p></p>Naturally, letting Mahiru clean while he relaxed by himself would be
        <p></p>terribly rude, and he wouldn't be able to stand the pangs of conscience, so
        <p></p>Amane intended to clean something else on his own.
        <p></p>The other day he had just happened to see a video of someone polishing
        <p></p>a sink, and it had piqued his interest, so he decided to take this opportunity
        <p></p>to challenge himself.
        <p></p>The important thing seemed to be to take the time and polish it
        <p></p>thoroughly and evenly. Amane figured that even he should be able to do it.
        <p></p>"Do you have all the right tools? You need waterproof sandpaper and a
        <p></p>polishing agent."
        <p></p>"…I'll go buy them now."
        <p></p>It was something he had suddenly made up his mind to do, so it wasn't
        <p></p>as if he had the tools on hand. He was about to make a shopping run, but
        <p></p>Mahiru's exasperated look was painful.
        <p></p>"Right, I thought you'd say that. I've got both in my apartment, so I'll
        <p></p>give you some. It's best to get all your cleaning supplies together ahead of
        <p></p>time."
        <p></p>"I don't suppose I should be surprised. You're so thorough, I feel bad."
        <p></p>"Well, the very fact that you felt like you wanted to do it is a big deal."
        <p></p>"Don't try to be nice about it."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh. All right, I'm going to change. I'll bring the stuff back with
        <p></p>me."
        <p></p>"…It must be some serious work if you're going to the trouble of
        <p></p>changing clothes."
        <p></p>"I'm about to do some serious cleaning, understand?"
        <p></p>At the moment, Mahiru was dressed in a long gray skirt with a
        <p></p>herringbone pattern, plus a matching black knit top. It was a subdued and
        <p></p>modest outfit that suited her well.
        <p></p>She probably could have cooked as usual in those clothes, but they
        <p></p>looked as if they would be very difficult to clean in, and he had no doubt
        <p></p>that it would be a disaster if she got detergent on them and bleached the
        <p></p>fabric.
        <p></p>He quietly mumbled something about her once again dressing in a cute
        <p></p>outfit that looked difficult to move in, and Mahiru pressed her lips tightly
        <p></p>together, then ground her fist into his waist for a reason he really didn't
        <p></p>understand. Of course, it wasn't exactly a punch, so it wasn't really painful.
        <p></p>He just felt a light pressure.
        <p></p>"What was that for all of a sudden, Miss Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"…Nothing. Don't worry about it."
        <p></p>"You're pressing awfully hard over nothing, though."
        <p></p>"It's nothing."
        <p></p>Amane was bewildered. Clearly it wasn't nothing, but Mahiru turned
        <p></p>away and hurried out the door.
        <p></p>When Mahiru returned from changing her clothes, she handed Amane a
        <p></p>metal polishing kit, and he quickly got to work on the sink. She had
        <p></p>changed into casual clothes, wearing pants with her hair up in a bun, and
        <p></p>went straight into the bathroom wearing rubber gloves and bursting with
        <p></p>motivation.
        <p></p>She had been all fired up to do the cleaning, so Amane timidly left her to
        <p></p>it, figuring it was all right to accept the favor.
        <p></p>Determined not to be outdone, Amane started going to work on the sink,
        <p></p>sandpaper in hand.
        <p></p>He properly ordered the sandpaper by grit, carefully smoothing out any
        <p></p>scratches that had originally been on the sink surface, while taking care not
        <p></p>to scrub too hard and cause new ones.
        <p></p>Since he lived in a rental apartment, there were also probably traces
        <p></p>from when the people before him had lived there. The sink wasn't filthy,
        <p></p>but its surface was cloudy, a far cry from the glistening new ones he saw on
        <p></p>television.
        <p></p>He polished patiently, trying to cut through the cloudiness, and his mood
        <p></p>improved when he realized on the second set of sandpaper that the metallic
        <p></p>luster was steadily coming back.
        <p></p>With visible results, his enthusiasm soared, and Amane, who had always
        <p></p>been the sort of person who found it difficult to stop once he focused on
        <p></p>something, continued polishing away in silence.
        <p></p>Suddenly, when he looked to the side, he saw Mahiru standing beside
        <p></p>him, silently watching him work. He had no idea when she had gotten there.
        <p></p>"…Say something if you're in here! You totally startled me."
        <p></p>"Sorry, you seemed really focused, so I didn't want to interrupt."
        <p></p>"You still could have said something, but…did you finish cleaning?"
        <p></p>"No, right now I'm letting some stubborn grime soak, so I've got an
        <p></p>hour to spare. I'm taking a short break."
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help but smile as Mahiru explained all this with deadly
        <p></p>seriousness, as if issuing a grim warning that letting the detergent penetrate
        <p></p>was crucial for getting rid of grime.
        <p></p>"Amane, you…still have a ways to go, huh? It's looking better, but it'll
        <p></p>take a while before you get that to a mirror finish."
        <p></p>"I've got one more sheet of high-grit sandpaper to go through. After
        <p></p>that, I'll wipe it down with a cloth soaked in the abrading agent. This is a
        <p></p>lot of work…"
        <p></p>"Well, it takes time and effort to make something look nice. You can
        <p></p>shorten the life span of the sink if you polish it too hard, though, so please
        <p></p>be careful."
        <p></p>"Rrrrroger!"
        <p></p>Indeed, since the sink was rental property, he understood that going
        <p></p>overboard was strictly forbidden. After all, the owners of the building ought
        <p></p>to take care of general maintenance.
        <p></p>"By the way, have you been polishing this whole time?"
        <p></p>"I guess so. I really got lost in it."
        <p></p>"This kind of work is fun, isn't it? That's the good thing about
        <p></p>cleaning."
        <p></p>"Well, I'm not taking it as seriously as you do, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"You say that, but you don't look like you're taking a break anytime
        <p></p>soon. It's just as important to get a proper amount of rest, Amane."
        <p></p>With an elegant laugh, Mahiru took out a glass and opened the
        <p></p>refrigerator.
        <p></p>"Are you thirsty, Amane?"
        <p></p>"We've got some orange juice in there, so I'd love it if you'd pour me a
        <p></p>glass."
        <p></p>"Got it."
        <p></p>Apparently, she was going to get Amane a drink.
        <p></p>He was grateful for her consideration. She took out the orange juice that
        <p></p>he had purchased earlier and poured a glass.
        <p></p>For some reason, she stuck a straw in it and held the glass to Amane's
        <p></p>mouth.
        <p></p>"Here you go."
        <p></p>She was offering him the juice with a grin, but it was obvious that she
        <p></p>had no intention of letting him take the glass from her.
        <p></p>She pointed the straw carefully toward him, as if urging him to drink,
        <p></p>and held it to his mouth.
        <p></p>"Thank…you?"
        <p></p>"Your hands are dirty, so I thought this would be the best way to do it."
        <p></p>It was true that his hands had gotten stained with black liquid while he
        <p></p>was polishing, but he could have easily washed them. He didn't need
        <p></p>Mahiru to go out of her way to take care of him like that, but she didn't
        <p></p>show the slightest sign of backing down.
        <p></p>He glanced over at Mahiru, and she looked back at him with an
        <p></p>invigorating smile, as if to say she had only the best intentions.
        <p></p>"…Won't I look really dumb?"
        <p></p>"I don't think so…probably not."
        <p></p>"Probably not, huh?"
        <p></p>"Just joking. But that black stuff won't come off unless you wash your
        <p></p>hands really well, so it would be extra effort to do that when you're still in
        <p></p>the middle of the job, right? That's why I think this is more efficient."
        <p></p>"That may be true, but—"
        <p></p>If that's the issue, couldn't you just set it beside the sink? Amane
        <p></p>thought. But he knew that even if he said that, Mahiru wasn't going to
        <p></p>relent.
        <p></p>He figured that there was no use in arguing further, and when he gave up
        <p></p>and put the straw in his mouth, Mahiru's smile of satisfaction grew.
        <p></p>As the fresh, tart sweetness of the orange juice spread through his
        <p></p>mouth, Amane concealed the bashfulness that was slowly welling up inside
        <p></p>him.
        <p></p>"…Is it good?"
        <p></p>"Mm, it's good. Thank you."
        <p></p>Since she had only filled about half of a glass that wasn't that large to
        <p></p>begin with, he quickly finished the juice and thanked her.
        <p></p>While he was at it, he shot her a look that said You don't need to do that
        <p></p>again, but Mahiru just chuckled softly.
        <p></p>"Please call me anytime you want a drink, okay?"
        <p></p>"No, next time I'll wash my hands like normal and get it on my own."
        <p></p>"Oh, too bad."
        <p></p>Now she's teasing me.
        <p></p>Every so often, Mahiru did things like this. It made him wonder if giving
        <p></p>him a jolt to the heart was a game for her. They were minor things, but her
        <p></p>pranks always gave him quite a shock.
        <p></p>This time, although she was undoubtedly teasing him, she also had good
        <p></p>intentions, so he couldn't even complain.
        <p></p>Exasperated, he shot her a reproachful look, but Mahiru laughed happily
        <p></p>again.
        <p></p>Mahiru went back to her own cleaning, and Amane scrubbed the sink over
        <p></p>and over again, changing the grit of the sandpaper as he went, until all that
        <p></p>was left was the final polish.
        <p></p>The sink was already mirrorlike, and he knew that it would shine even
        <p></p>more beautifully once he put on the finishing touches.
        <p></p>Thinking it was about time for the final polish with the abrading
        <p></p>compound, Amane had just washed his hands so he could search for an old
        <p></p>towel when the loud noise of something large falling over rang out from the
        <p></p>bathroom.
        <p></p>He dashed over without even turning off the running water, expecting
        <p></p>the worst, and saw Mahiru on her backside. It looked as if she had
        <p></p>collapsed.
        <p></p>She seemed kind of stunned and didn't try to get up, even as she got
        <p></p>soaked by the spray of water from the shower nozzle that had also fallen on
        <p></p>the floor.
        <p></p>"Are you okay?! I heard a huge noise just now?!"
        <p></p>"I let my feet slip… I'm not injured, but my butt hurts. That was my
        <p></p>mistake."
        <p></p>As if Amane's voice finally broke the spell, her eyes darted around the
        <p></p>room in shame as she looked up at him.
        <p></p>Apparently, she had slipped and fallen while rinsing the walls. There
        <p></p>were still little clumps of bubbles in the corners of the tub, pushed there by
        <p></p>the overflowing water, and Mahiru's clothes were completely soaked
        <p></p>through where she had been hit by the spray on her way down.
        <p></p>"Sorry; this is because I left the cleaning to you…"
        <p></p>"No, I was the one who suggested it, so…"
        <p></p>Amane turned off the running shower right away and offered his hand to
        <p></p>Mahiru, who was still sitting on the floor looking up at him. "You didn't
        <p></p>twist your ankle, did you?" he asked. "Can you stand?"
        <p></p>Mahiru cast her eyes downward in embarrassment, then gingerly took
        <p></p>Amane's hand. "I just landed on my rump. I was crouching to begin with,
        <p></p>so I didn't have that far to fall. It only made so much noise because the
        <p></p>washbasin fell down with me. It was my fault, so don't worry about me."
        <p></p>"No, I'm definitely still worried, and…you're dripping wet, too…"
        <p></p>Amane planted his feet firmly on the floor as he helped Mahiru up. He
        <p></p>did not want to let her fall down again. He looked her over once more, to
        <p></p>confirm that she wasn't injured, and froze.
        <p></p>Mahiru had been soaked by the running shower. And her clothing, which
        <p></p>she had chosen for cleaning indoors, wasn't very wintery, just a simple
        <p></p>long-sleeved white shirt and a pair of leggings. That fact spelled Amane's
        <p></p>doom.
        <p></p>Her tight-fitting clothes gained a terrible destructive power when they
        <p></p>got wet. The silhouette of her body was extremely apparent, as was the
        <p></p>color and shape of what she was wearing underneath.
        <p></p>Under her shirt, Amane could see the color of her skin, and he caught a
        <p></p>glimpse of something lime green showing through the fabric before
        <p></p>averting his eyes in a panic.
        <p></p>Amane felt like he might die of shame if he looked directly at her, and
        <p></p>he could imagine how upset Mahiru would be if he stared.
        <p></p>On the other hand, he knew that she would suspect something if he
        <p></p>blatantly avoided looking in her direction, so once he helped Mahiru up,
        <p></p>Amane grabbed a towel from the adjacent changing room and somehow
        <p></p>managed to wrap it around her shoulders without looking.
        <p></p>However, Mahiru apparently realized the awful state she was in, and she
        <p></p>appeared to take Amane's act of desperation as one of kindness, so she
        <p></p>smiled at him.
        <p></p>Seeing her smiling face made it even harder for Amane to look directly
        <p></p>at her, and he turned away.
        <p></p>He felt as if he wanted to punch himself for thinking such perverse
        <p></p>thoughts, even for a moment, but he somehow used reason to calm his
        <p></p>overly excited body.
        <p></p>"I'll lend you a change of clothes, but if you want to go home after you
        <p></p>change, you should wait until you're dry. If you go outside wet in this
        <p></p>temperature, you'll catch a cold."
        <p></p>"Thank you very much for your concern… But if I look so funny that
        <p></p>you have to turn away to laugh, I'd rather you just laugh in my face."
        <p></p>"Why would you think I was laughing?! Your shirt's see-through, so I
        <p></p>was just trying not to look!!"
        <p></p>He had been doing his best to evade the subject and give her a chance to
        <p></p>change, but since Mahiru had groundlessly misunderstood his intentions, he
        <p></p>had snapped at her without thinking. Now he was in real trouble, because
        <p></p>Mahiru's cheeks were turning red.
        <p></p>She glanced down at her own body, and her face flushed in an instant,
        <p></p>then she quickly pulled the towel closed around her. Amane could finally
        <p></p>catch his breath.
        <p></p>That said, he still couldn't meet her eye and was letting his gaze wander
        <p></p>around the room.
        <p></p>"Uh…um, r-really, thanks for your concern…"
        <p></p>"…It's mostly my fault for letting you do the cleaning, so for now, if
        <p></p>you would get changed, I'd appreciate it. If you want to take a shower to
        <p></p>warm up, that's okay, too. I'll bring you some fresh clothes."
        <p></p>Mahiru probably did not envy Amane in this situation. And Amane
        <p></p>found it hard to stay rational, alone with her.
        <p></p>He found the perfect excuse and made his escape.
        <p></p>After passing Mahiru some clothes, Amane again focused intently on
        <p></p>polishing the sink.
        <p></p>He wanted to preserve his willpower of steel, but certain urges were
        <p></p>steadily eroding it, threatening to make it collapse. In an attempt to scrape
        <p></p>them away, he emptied his mind as he polished the sink with the abrading
        <p></p>agent and tried to the best of his ability to banish the earlier incident from
        <p></p>his thoughts.
        <p></p>Mahiru had gotten quite chilly, so she was taking a shower. He could
        <p></p>hear the sound of water running and striking the floor from the bathroom.
        <p></p>There's a girl taking a shower in my home.
        <p></p>When he had this objective thought, he realized the unthinkable reality
        <p></p>of the situation and shook his head to quickly dispel any wild fantasies.
        <p></p>Beating himself up for his thoughts, he polished away at the sink, trying
        <p></p>to clear any uninvited ideas from his mind. It wasn't exactly a flawless
        <p></p>finish, but the metal now smoothly reflected the light well enough that he
        <p></p>could see his own face on the surface.
        <p></p>The face that he saw reflected in the sink was bright red. He knew that
        <p></p>he had to get ahold of himself before Mahiru came back.
        <p></p>It was no laughing matter that his feelings of guilt, born from shame and
        <p></p>pangs of conscience, were stronger than his excitement at finishing the
        <p></p>polishing.
        <p></p>Forget it, forget it.
        <p></p>Figuring that he was probably about done with polishing, Amane rinsed
        <p></p>away the last of the abrading agent from the sink and then washed his
        <p></p>hands.
        <p></p>Then he vigorously splashed his face with water. If he couldn't get the
        <p></p>terrible heat under control quickly, he wouldn't be able to face Mahiru.
        <p></p>Over and over, he splashed himself with the cold wintertime water,
        <p></p>enjoying how it cooled his face and head. He was still splashing when he
        <p></p>heard the sound of the fittings on the bathroom door creaking open.
        <p></p>He knew that she would be coming out before too long, so as he forced
        <p></p>his pounding heart to settle down, he put one spoonful of honey and a
        <p></p>splash of milk into a mug for Mahiru and stuck it in the microwave.
        <p></p>Just as it finished warming up, Mahiru slowly emerged from the
        <p></p>changing area, slapping the floor with her slippers as she walked.
        <p></p>"…Thanks for letting me borrow your clothes," she said to Amane, who
        <p></p>was still in the kitchen. She had just gotten out of the shower, so warmth
        <p></p>was radiating gently off her and into her surroundings.
        <p></p>In reaction to the earlier incident where her shirt got soaked, Amane had
        <p></p>intentionally chosen to loan her a sweatsuit that was too large so that her
        <p></p>silhouette wouldn't show.
        <p></p>Thanks to that decision, she looked very comfortable in his house
        <p></p>clothes, but for some reason, her appearance still made his heart pound, and
        <p></p>he couldn't help but feel that he was never going to calm down, no matter
        <p></p>what he did.
        <p></p>"Here you go. Take this, too."
        <p></p>"…Thank you very much."
        <p></p>He had more or less gotten to the point where he could look directly at
        <p></p>her again, so keeping himself as calm as possible, he took the hot milk out
        <p></p>of the microwave, stirred it with a spoon, and then handed it to Mahiru.
        <p></p>Mahiru liked sweets, and when she noticed the smell of the honey, she
        <p></p>smiled gently. Then she looked at the sink behind Amane, and her smile
        <p></p>grew.
        <p></p>"Oh, you finished that beautifully. You really worked hard at it. Good
        <p></p>job."
        <p></p>"…I guess."
        <p></p>He wasn't going to tell her that he had done it to drive away his worldly
        <p></p>desires, so he just nodded and gave her a vague reply. Then Amane casually
        <p></p>brushed past her and sat down on the sofa.
        <p></p>As he was taking deep breaths, Mahiru also trotted over and sat beside
        <p></p>him, making it impossible for him to settle down. The fact that he could
        <p></p>smell the scent of his own body soap wafting toward him made it all the
        <p></p>worse.
        <p></p>When he glanced over at her, he saw her hands poking out of the sleeves
        <p></p>of the much-too-large clothing, gripping the mug as she earnestly blew on it
        <p></p>to cool down its contents.
        <p></p>She looked strangely adorable as she brought the drink up to her mouth
        <p></p>once, immediately pulled away because it was too hot, then glared at the
        <p></p>offending mug with a frown.
        <p></p>Though from her perspective, she was probably just trying to cool down
        <p></p>her milk, the oversized clothing made her look especially small and
        <p></p>adorable.
        <p></p>Even an unfashionable sweatsuit looked cute when Mahiru wore it.
        <p></p>What a terrifying thing a beautiful girl could be.
        <p></p>After struggling for some time, Mahiru happily sipped her hot milk once
        <p></p>it finally reached a drinkable temperature. She must have noticed Amane
        <p></p>looking at her, because she took her mouth off the mug and cocked her
        <p></p>head.
        <p></p>"Is something the matter?" she asked.
        <p></p>"Uh, no…just worried that you might be hurt."
        <p></p>Amane wasn't lying, but he wasn't telling the whole truth, either.
        <p></p>He was concerned that Mahiru might have hurt herself in the fall, and he
        <p></p>was also concerned about her catching a cold. However, at the same time,
        <p></p>quite a lot of his mind was occupied by his agitation at having seen the
        <p></p>suggestive curves of her body when she was completely soaked, even
        <p></p>though she hadn't actually exposed any skin.
        <p></p>Mahiru had no doubts about Amane's words, and she frowned in
        <p></p>vexation, then chuckled. "…Sorry for being such a bother today."
        <p></p>"No, don't be silly. I'm the one who caused trouble for you. Are you
        <p></p>sure you're not hurt?"
        <p></p>"I'm fine now, it doesn't even hurt to touch my backside where I hit it…
        <p></p>I'm not letting you touch it, though. Got that?"
        <p></p>"I wouldn't!"
        <p></p>"Just joking."
        <p></p>Mahiru snickered at Amane's instant response. Still grappling with his
        <p></p>complicated feelings, he grumbled quietly, "…Don't tease me."
        <p></p>"It's just that you seemed kind of down. I was the one who suggested I
        <p></p>clean, so there's no need for you to fret over it, Amane."
        <p></p>"This only happened because I didn't pay attention while cleaning on
        <p></p>my own, so I do feel bad."
        <p></p>If Amane had cleaned properly on a regular basis, Mahiru never
        <p></p>would've needed to roll up her sleeves, meaning there also wouldn't have
        <p></p>been any opportunity for her to get soaked in the first place.
        <p></p>"Well, I can't deny that, but it's quite a difficult task to get everything
        <p></p>perfectly clean. You don't have to look so sorry."
        <p></p>"…Even so—"
        <p></p>"Oh, come on. Everyone makes mistakes when they're doing something
        <p></p>unfamiliar. You just have to be careful next time… Now you know what to
        <p></p>look for when you're cleaning, right?"
        <p></p>"I'm taking this deeply to heart."
        <p></p>"Great. So don't worry so much, okay?"
        <p></p>Amane was seriously contemplating the fact that he had neglected the
        <p></p>grime, which had led to Mahiru's fall and her subsequent accident, but
        <p></p>Mahiru must have taken his demeanor as an expression of earnest apology.
        <p></p>A small smile appeared on her face.
        <p></p>She set her mug down on the table and used the extra length of her
        <p></p>sleeves to slap at Amane, trying to cheer him up. "Don't be so down in the
        <p></p>dumps!"
        <p></p>Naturally, since Amane was on the taller side, and especially since he
        <p></p>had purposely given her clothes that were too big even for him, Mahiru had
        <p></p>quite a lot of extra sleeve to work with. They had so much extra fabric that
        <p></p>if she didn't put her arms through them and roll them up, they covered her
        <p></p>fingers with enough extra to fold over on themselves.
        <p></p>Evidently, she had decided to weaponize those sleeves and seemed to be
        <p></p>having fun whacking Amane with them.
        <p></p>"Owww."
        <p></p>"You sound like a robot!"
        <p></p>"No, really, it hurts, it hurts!"
        <p></p>It didn't, of course, but the adorableness of her actions caused some
        <p></p>noticeable pangs in his chest.
        <p></p>Mahiru had no way of knowing that was happening as she scolded
        <p></p>Amane sweetly with a cherubic smile.
        <p></p>To Amane, it was unbelievably cute, and he wasn't sure what to do.
        <p></p>"I'm good already, just relax… Well, I am still sorry that you ended up
        <p></p>having to change, though."
        <p></p>"I fell down all on my own. If anything, this showed me that I need to
        <p></p>watch my footing. I feel bad that I had to ask you to lend me a change of
        <p></p>clothes."
        <p></p>"No, but…"
        <p></p>"Stop. If we go back and forth on this any longer, you're going to start
        <p></p>another pity party in your brain, so this ends now. Got it?"
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled somewhat impishly after gently covering Amane's mouth
        <p></p>with the extra-folded-over sleeve, and Amane also couldn't help breaking
        <p></p>into a grin.
        <p></p>Vowing to shove the memory of what he had seen as far down as he
        <p></p>possibly could, he looked at Mahiru in the baggy sweatsuit again.
        <p></p>"Do you want to go home for a bit and change?"
        <p></p>He made the suggestion assuming that it must be difficult to move
        <p></p>around in such baggy clothes and that she'd prefer wearing her own clothes,
        <p></p>but to his surprise, Mahiru shook her head slowly.
        <p></p>"No, I'll stay like this a little longer."
        <p></p>"…Okay."
        <p></p>Mahiru hid her mouth with the excess sleeve, but he could tell from the
        <p></p>way the area around her eyes softened that she was feeling bashful. For
        <p></p>some reason, he felt an intense urge to pat her on the head.
        <p></p>"…You're pretty tall and skinny, aren't you, Amane? I was shocked by
        <p></p>the size of these pants. The waist is surprisingly small."
        <p></p>"I guess that's because overall, it's harder for me to put on weight than it
        <p></p>is for girls."
        <p></p>"I'm a little jealous. I knew that, but I still envy you."
        <p></p>Amane figured there was bound to be a difference between men and
        <p></p>women, since men generally have higher metabolisms than women and
        <p></p>therefore have a harder time gaining subcutaneous fat, but that was neither
        <p></p>here nor there.
        <p></p>With a very serious look on her face, Mahiru slid right up to Amane,
        <p></p>who shrank back. Without any hesitation, she patted his waist with her
        <p></p>palm.
        <p></p>Amane knew he was on the slender side, so he figured that as long as
        <p></p>she wasn't talking about muscles, he had no reason to stop her, and he
        <p></p>decided to let her do as she pleased.
        <p></p>And then as he was holding still, he was suddenly filled with the intense
        <p></p>urge to go back and wallop the Amane who had chosen those clothes for her
        <p></p>about an hour earlier.
        <p></p>He had chosen his largest sweats, with the goal of obscuring her figure
        <p></p>so that he wouldn't think about her body. But now his strategy was
        <p></p>completely backfiring.
        <p></p>He didn't feel comfortable with fabric pressing against his throat, so he
        <p></p>preferred sweatshirts that were made somewhat loose in the neck, but that
        <p></p>had been an inappropriate choice to give to Mahiru.
        <p></p>Since she was so small, the neck of the shirt slouched forward, and the
        <p></p>fabric was pulled down by gravity, leaving a large gap between the shirt and
        <p></p>her body.
        <p></p>He could see her translucent, milky-white skin through the neck
        <p></p>opening.
        <p></p>He could see that, just as the fabric obeyed the law of gravity, so too did
        <p></p>it heavily emphasize the weight of those things that Mahiru had and Amane
        <p></p>didn't—the things that formed a great white valley that was normally
        <p></p>hidden from view.
        <p></p>Amane looked to his heart's content at the bounty that had been wrapped
        <p></p>in light lime green and wet cloth earlier. Then he averted his eyes with great
        <p></p>force.
        <p></p>His heart was thumping loudly.
        <p></p>She's gotta do something about leaving herself so defenseless in
        <p></p>situations like this.
        <p></p>On the whole, he didn't think that Mahiru was particularly careless.
        <p></p>She did not wear revealing clothing in public. Usually, she chose sturdy,
        <p></p>protective garments that only allowed the skin on her hands and face to
        <p></p>show. Her modesty was almost admirable.
        <p></p>And yet here they were.
        <p></p>Even though Amane had caused the issue, at the moment, Mahiru wasn't
        <p></p>considering the position of his face. She probably never thought that Amane
        <p></p>would look there. She was in a defenseless state on account of her trust in
        <p></p>him, he thought.
        <p></p>From the back of his mind, he recalled the sight of her wet underwear
        <p></p>and curvy silhouette, and his heart pounded loudly again.
        <p></p>"…Amane?"
        <p></p>When he heard her say his name in a voice that was less suspicious and
        <p></p>more curious, Amane bit his lip and stood up with great force.
        <p></p>He heard a small, cute exclamation but couldn't look in her direction.
        <p></p>"…I, um…I think I'll take a shower, too. I got sweaty doing all that
        <p></p>polishing!"
        <p></p>As soon as he said that, Amane attempted to flee the scene, retreating
        <p></p>from Mahiru, who, while innocent, still possessed great destructive power.
        <p></p>Leaving behind her bewildered voice, Amane burst into his bedroom,
        <p></p>grabbed some clothes, and escaped to the bathroom, feeling ashamed and
        <p></p>despicable for looking directly at them, even if for just a moment.
        <p></p>Only a minute passed before, this time, Amane fell down in the bathroom,
        <p></p>and Mahiru came running in a panic.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 73: Who’s Spoiling Whom? 
        <p></p>"…What are you doing?"
        <p></p>Mahiru looked at him suspiciously when she arrived to make dinner.
        <p></p>Amane was just cleaning up the cardboard from a package that had
        <p></p>suddenly arrived courtesy of his parents.
        <p></p>The look in her eye that said This wasn't here yesterday was only
        <p></p>natural, Amane thought, but he was just a passive recipient who also had no
        <p></p>clue about this.
        <p></p>It was plain to see that the package was oversized for Amane. The thing
        <p></p>was the right size to push up alongside a low table, and when he struck it
        <p></p>gently, it made the rustling sound of little pellets faintly rubbing against one
        <p></p>another as they fell.
        <p></p>"It came from my parents, as a congratulatory gift for making it to the
        <p></p>next school year. Have you never seen one before?"
        <p></p>The unsolicited package contained a big beanbag that took up tons of
        <p></p>space. A huge cushion, big enough to sit on, of the sort that he had seen
        <p></p>advertised on TV and the internet.
        <p></p>Beanbags had been quite popular for several years, and Amane thought
        <p></p>they were common knowledge, but Mahiru didn't seem to know about
        <p></p>them.
        <p></p>"Well, I've heard rumors about them for a while. It's like an evil sofa
        <p></p>that sucks you into a vortex of your own depravity and idleness once you sit
        <p></p>down, right?"
        <p></p>"What kind of overblown rumors have you been hearing?"
        <p></p>Though he was a little taken aback by her describing the beanbag as a
        <p></p>sinister object or whatever, he knew that the cushion was indeed supposed
        <p></p>to feel so nice that once you sat down, you'd lose the will to move, so he
        <p></p>couldn't necessarily refute her statement.
        <p></p>This particular beanbag was rather long and large enough for two people
        <p></p>to sit on it at once.
        <p></p>It was obviously too big for just one person. Clearly, Amane was not
        <p></p>meant to sit on it alone.
        <p></p>I can feel them pressuring me to sit with Mahiru…
        <p></p>He was sure that otherwise, his parents would have sent something a
        <p></p>little smaller.
        <p></p>Sure enough, a long time ago, by which he meant when he was in
        <p></p>middle school, Amane had told his parents he wanted a cushion like this
        <p></p>one. But they had rejected his request, since at that time he had been
        <p></p>incredibly lazy and had slacked off in all sorts of ways.
        <p></p>They must have thought that wasn't an issue anymore, though Amane
        <p></p>expected that the reason why he wasn't lazy anymore was because Mahiru
        <p></p>was by his side.
        <p></p>With an exasperated sigh, he put the dark blue slipcover onto the
        <p></p>beanbag and then stared at it.
        <p></p>He would have appreciated it if they'd asked him if he had any space in
        <p></p>his home before sending such a bulky object. But they seemed to have been
        <p></p>counting on the fact that his room had been tidy when they had checked in
        <p></p>around New Year's and that Amane wouldn't let it get cluttered with
        <p></p>Mahiru around.
        <p></p>"…This is really huge, isn't it? Will you put it in your room?"
        <p></p>"I think that's the only option. I don't have much in my room, so there's
        <p></p>space for it, but Mom always does things like this out of the blue, geez."
        <p></p>For now, he had gotten the beanbag out of the packaging and pulled the
        <p></p>cover on, but there was no way he could leave it in the living room. He had
        <p></p>just barely gotten it in there for the time being by moving the low table out
        <p></p>of the way.
        <p></p>For better or worse, Amane's bedroom contained a bed, a desk for
        <p></p>schoolwork, a small bookshelf, and nothing else. A beanbag of this size
        <p></p>would make it a little difficult to open the closet, but it would fit.
        <p></p>"Shihoko always commits when she decides to do something, doesn't
        <p></p>she? Even so, it's awfully big."
        <p></p>"…Sure is."
        <p></p>"It's so big you could probably lie down on it."
        <p></p>If Shihoko had been there, Amane could have imagined her saying,
        <p></p>"Why don't the two of you sit on it together?"
        <p></p>A guy and girl sitting close together on something like this would be too
        <p></p>much. Everyone knows that.
        <p></p>While Amane was thinking up comebacks to say to the imaginary
        <p></p>mother cackling joyfully in his head, he looked over at Mahiru and saw her
        <p></p>staring intently at the beanbag.
        <p></p>He could tell from the way she talked that she had never seen a real one
        <p></p>before, but it seemed to have caught her interest.
        <p></p>Her eyes, which always had a gentle light behind them, were more
        <p></p>animated than normal. They sparkled brightly, revealing her curiosity. She
        <p></p>was buzzing with impatience.
        <p></p>Mahiru slowly extended a hand toward the big beanbag…and withdrew
        <p></p>it before she could touch it. She was probably being mindful not to touch
        <p></p>other people's belongings without asking.
        <p></p>"…I put the cover on, so wanna sit?"
        <p></p>"Ah!"
        <p></p>She seemed so restless that he suggested it without thinking, but he got a
        <p></p>little shriek in response.
        <p></p>As far as Amane was concerned, if Mahiru was that interested in the
        <p></p>beanbag, then she should go ahead and just try it. That's what he had been
        <p></p>thinking when he made that suggestion, but she was so openly flustered that
        <p></p>he worried he had actually said something weird.
        <p></p>"N-no, um, I—I appreciate you offering, but…the owner should enjoy it
        <p></p>first."
        <p></p>"You look like you want to sit on it, and I'm not worried about all that.
        <p></p>I'm sure my mother sent it hoping you would sit on it, too, so if you want to
        <p></p>sit, go ahead and sit."
        <p></p>"Ah, um…i-is it really all right?"
        <p></p>"I wouldn't say that if it wasn't. I don't really mind who uses it first.
        <p></p>You seem curious, so I'd rather have you try it out first."
        <p></p>"O-oh…w-well then, I'll take you up on that."
        <p></p>Mahiru said she wouldn't hesistate, but she approached the beanbag
        <p></p>timidly, seeming to hold back as best she could. Then with some hesitation,
        <p></p>she lowered herself onto the cushion.
        <p></p>It made a little rustling sound and contorted into a different shape to
        <p></p>envelop Mahiru's dainty body.
        <p></p>She must have felt strange sitting so much lower than she would on a
        <p></p>normal sofa. Mahiru blinked several times in surprise and looked down at
        <p></p>the beanbag beneath her.
        <p></p>After that, she wriggled around to adjust the way she was sitting, then
        <p></p>stood up and sat back down again.
        <p></p>After checking the way she sank slowly into the beanbag, she leaned her
        <p></p>body weight as far back as she could and stretched out like she was going to
        <p></p>take a little nap. In a livelier voice than usual, Mahiru mumbled, "This feels
        <p></p>amazing."
        <p></p>Amane was pretty sure she hadn't said those words for him to hear.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to have immediately fallen captive to the shifting
        <p></p>beanbag's allure. She rolled around, searching for the most comfortable
        <p></p>position.
        <p></p>Thank goodness she wore pants today, Amane thought earnestly as he
        <p></p>watched her.
        <p></p>She had thrown herself down on the beanbag with complete abandon, so
        <p></p>if she had been wearing one of the voluminous skirts she usually had on,
        <p></p>even if it had been long, he might have been able to see her underwear.
        <p></p>As he watched Mahiru enjoy the beanbag, Amane felt quite sated, even
        <p></p>though they hadn't eaten dinner yet.
        <p></p>Mahiru was overwhelmingly adorable on the occasions when she played
        <p></p>around and showed her childish side, and Amane couldn't help but smile as
        <p></p>he watched her. But then, whether she realized what he was feeling or not,
        <p></p>Mahiru looked at Amane and beckoned to him.
        <p></p>"You might as well get on here, too, Amane. Come here."
        <p></p>He was sure she was inviting him with the best of intentions, wanting to
        <p></p>share the fun and comfort of the beanbag, but if he sat down next to Mahiru,
        <p></p>their bodies would definitely stick together.
        <p></p>No matter how dainty and small Mahiru was, or how big the beanbag
        <p></p>sofa was, if the two of them sat on it together, they would never be able to
        <p></p>keep their distance.
        <p></p>"N-no, I…I think I'll hold off."
        <p></p>"…You don't want to?"
        <p></p>"Th-that's not it, but, um, it's just, how do I put this…uh…"
        <p></p>He tried to come up with a good reason for refusing, but when Mahiru
        <p></p>peered up at him in confusion, he lost the willpower to say anything.
        <p></p>The devil inside him whispered problematically in his ear, "It's basically
        <p></p>like cuddling, which you do all the time, so it shouldn't be a problem,
        <p></p>right?" He groaned, but…he gave in to Mahiru's pure good intentions and
        <p></p>his own desires.
        <p></p>Once I sit down, I'm sure Mahiru will see the reason why I'm so
        <p></p>reluctant.
        <p></p>He took a seat beside her.
        <p></p>Both the nice feeling of sinking down into the cushion as the beanbag
        <p></p>hugged his body and the warmth and scent of Mahiru beside him
        <p></p>overwhelmed his senses.
        <p></p>The feeling of his body sinking into the beanbag was a little different
        <p></p>because Mahiru was there, but even so, he could tell how nice it was. He
        <p></p>could understand why so many people wanted a beanbag, just from the
        <p></p>feeling of sitting on that one.
        <p></p>But at the moment, he was distracted from the sensation of the beanbag
        <p></p>sofa by Mahiru beside him, her guard completely down.
        <p></p>"Isn't it incredible? It molds perfectly to your body!"
        <p></p>"…That's definitely true."
        <p></p>"Seems like it would be fun to relax here. You could read a book or
        <p></p>watch a movie… If you took it easy, I bet the hours would just fly by,"
        <p></p>Mahiru mumbled in a soft and somehow intoxicated-sounding voice.
        <p></p>More relaxed than she had been earlier, she leaned lightly against
        <p></p>Amane and sighed.
        <p></p>Even though she had been saying something really adorable, for some
        <p></p>reason it came off a little sexy, which Amane attributed to the fact that he
        <p></p>could feel her body heat.
        <p></p>"…Well, how can you help it when it feels so nice? That's why I don't
        <p></p>want to sit on it. I just know it'll ruin me."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, I understand how you feel. When it feels this nice, it
        <p></p>immediately makes you want to slack off."
        <p></p>Amane's lips threatened to soften into a smile at these unexpected words
        <p></p>from Mahiru, who was normally so disciplined. But she was leaning against
        <p></p>his shoulder and nuzzling her cheek against him in apparent delight, and he
        <p></p>couldn't let himself get lost in the moment.
        <p></p>He knew that she probably didn't mean anything by those fawning
        <p></p>gestures of hers.
        <p></p>She often headbutted him to hide her embarrassment, but this time she
        <p></p>was leaning her whole weight on him, her body almost melting into his, and
        <p></p>snuggling up against him to boot.
        <p></p>A fragrance wafted up from her hair that was both sweet and refreshing.
        <p></p>He knew that she had showered earlier because they'd had gym class
        <p></p>that day. It was quite the temptation for Amane to take in that scent from so
        <p></p>close up.
        <p></p>He glanced down at Mahiru, and through the gaps in her gently flowing
        <p></p>hair, he could see the smooth, milky-white nape of her neck. He swallowed
        <p></p>loudly as he basked in her radiance.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't tell whether Mahiru, who looked so loose and relaxed
        <p></p>that she might have been in heaven, had noticed his stiffness or the sound
        <p></p>from his throat.
        <p></p>Mahiru glanced up at Amane and put on a languid smile that made her
        <p></p>look even more angelic than usual, then leaned heavily against him again.
        <p></p>…I'm spoiled, in so many ways.
        <p></p>He knew that he needed to say to Mahiru that they would need to get up
        <p></p>and fix dinner soon.
        <p></p>But he didn't want to ruin this moment of pure bliss with words, nor did
        <p></p>he want to pull away from her warmth, so Amane swallowed the quiet
        <p></p>words when they rose to the surface and buttoned his lips tight.
        <p></p>That night, they had instant ramen for dinner.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 74: Childhood Anxieties, and Reassurance in the Present 
        <p></p>Lately, Mahiru had been spending basically every weekend at Amane's
        <p></p>place.
        <p></p>She gave a very characteristic explanation that she was concerned about
        <p></p>his unhealthy lifestyle. But the truth was that she actually just wanted to be
        <p></p>with the person she liked.
        <p></p>Of course, it was important to both her and Amane to have their alone
        <p></p>time, and she understood that she needed to use some restraint, so she never
        <p></p>barged in uninvited. She secretly, but attentively, observed and checked his
        <p></p>reactions to make sure that Amane wasn't bothered or annoyed by her
        <p></p>presence whenever they were together.
        <p></p>Happily, Amane never chided her for being in his home. He welcomed
        <p></p>her in as if it was the most natural thing, and he actually smiled when he
        <p></p>saw her. Sometimes, she worried she might be getting the wrong ideas.
        <p></p>How simpleminded do I have to be to get this happy just from paying
        <p></p>him a visit? Mahiru laughed at herself a little, and sure enough, her
        <p></p>expression softened as she did.
        <p></p>She slapped her cheeks lightly to gather herself and compose her face.
        <p></p>Then, using her spare key, Mahiru entered Amane's apartment.
        <p></p>She stepped into the entryway but didn't hear a sound.
        <p></p>Her first thought was that he might be napping in his room, but then she
        <p></p>saw that the sneakers Amane usually wore were missing. It took her another
        <p></p>moment to realize he had gone out.
        <p></p>If she had to say, she would have described Amane as a homebody, so it
        <p></p>was unusual for him to go out at that hour. She was half-surprised and half-
        <p></p>worried and unsure what to do next.
        <p></p>…I wonder if it's all right for me to relax here without asking. I'd be the
        <p></p>only one here, too…
        <p></p>She did have a spare key, and she had gotten permission to come and go
        <p></p>as she pleased, but she still wasn't sure about staying and making herself at
        <p></p>home when Amane wasn't there.
        <p></p>"You're welcome to go on in, even if I'm not home. It's not like you
        <p></p>would do anything bad, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"I wouldn't, but are you sure you approve of me going into your private
        <p></p>space on my own?"
        <p></p>"You want to go in my bedroom?"
        <p></p>"No, that's not what I mean, but…you're not worried that I might go in,
        <p></p>that I might see something?"
        <p></p>"Even if you did go in, there's nothing in there, so I'm not worried about
        <p></p>it. But I don't think you're the type to go snooping in my bedroom, so feel
        <p></p>free to relax in the living room whenever you want."
        <p></p>Even though they had already talked about it beforehand, it was still
        <p></p>another person's home, and she was a little—more than a little—hesitant.
        <p></p>They usually contacted each other if they were going to be out late, so
        <p></p>based on the fact that he hadn't gotten in touch, she didn't think that Amane
        <p></p>would be gone for very long.
        <p></p>There shouldn't be anything wrong with just waiting inside for a little
        <p></p>while.
        <p></p>Feeling guilty that she might be doing something she wasn't supposed
        <p></p>to, Mahiru timidly removed her shoes and stepped into the living room. The
        <p></p>place felt very still and quiet with no one at home.
        <p></p>The familiar smell of Amane's apartment was comforting, but the space
        <p></p>also seemed somewhat dreary and lacking something, because the person
        <p></p>she liked was not there.
        <p></p>She plopped down on the sofa as she always did and leaned against the
        <p></p>back.
        <p></p>Normally, when she sat on the sofa, she had Amane beside her. Once
        <p></p>they had both finished all their chores, when they were relaxing, they sat on
        <p></p>the sofa like this and had leisurely conversations or quietly spent time
        <p></p>together.
        <p></p>Now Amane was not there. His body heat, which was warmer than
        <p></p>Mahiru's; his subtle, fresh scent; his calm voice that wasn't too deep and
        <p></p>was easy to listen to; his body, which had become slim but sturdy and didn't
        <p></p>yield even when she leaned against him—all these things were missing.
        <p></p>Once it really sank in, Mahiru felt lonely.
        <p></p>"…I hope he comes back soon."
        <p></p>She laughed a little at the words that escaped her lips—even though she
        <p></p>was the one who'd said them, they sounded terribly lonely.
        <p></p>Even though it had been her choice to enter and wait for him, part of her
        <p></p>wanted to control Amane's time and felt incredibly alone when he wasn't
        <p></p>around, even though she was accustomed to being on her own. It was equal
        <p></p>parts ridiculous and pitiful.
        <p></p>She sighed at her own selfishness and let herself sink further into the
        <p></p>sofa.
        <p></p>Mahiru was used to waiting. She had only been alive for a short sixteen
        <p></p>years, but she had spent most of that time waiting for something. For many
        <p></p>years, she had waited, before finally giving up.
        <p></p>This was different. She was waiting for someone she knew was coming
        <p></p>back.
        <p></p>Even though she knew that, when she recalled the events of the past, she
        <p></p>felt an awful tightness deep in her chest.
        <p></p>…Sitting here like this reminds me of waiting so long for my parents.
        <p></p>She had locked away the bad memories in the depths of her heart,
        <p></p>holding them at arm's length, but now they reared their heads again.
        <p></p>The memory of waiting alone for her parents, never knowing if they
        <p></p>were coming back, filled her mind with a vengeance.
        <p></p>For almost as long as she could remember, there had never been anyone in
        <p></p>Mahiru's house.
        <p></p>Her family had rented out one whole floor of an apartment building,
        <p></p>which was more than enough space. It was a pleasant enough place to live,
        <p></p>with all the furnishings and modern conveniences anyone could hope for.
        <p></p>Mahiru had lived alone in that home.
        <p></p>To put it more accurately, her family wasn't there. Only Miss Koyuki,
        <p></p>her housekeeper and governess, but even she came and went. Mahiru's real
        <p></p>family, who should have been there, had vacated the house.
        <p></p>Her parents were busy with work and rarely ever came home, as if they
        <p></p>wanted nothing to do with Mahiru at all.
        <p></p>But it wouldn't have been socially acceptable for them to abandon her,
        <p></p>so they spared no expense to pay for Miss Koyuki's labor and Mahiru's
        <p></p>education, providing for their daughter at the same time they abandoned
        <p></p>her.
        <p></p>She became aware of that abandonment and realized that her situation
        <p></p>was abnormal after several years in elementary school. That was when she
        <p></p>recognized that she was the victim of child neglect. She also later realized
        <p></p>that her mother had a lover.
        <p></p>She realized it precisely because she was cleverer than other children
        <p></p>and because she wanted to be loved by her parents more badly than other
        <p></p>children. Even though that realization marked the end of her innocent
        <p></p>childhood.
        <p></p>"Mother?"
        <p></p>One day, when Mahiru was about halfway through elementary school,
        <p></p>she was delighted by one of her mother's rare appearances at home.
        <p></p>Overjoyed at seeing her normally absent mother, Mahiru rushed over to
        <p></p>her and spoke to her with a smile, but her mother didn't answer. It was as if
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't even exist. Her mother did not so much as look at her or even
        <p></p>turn to face her. She was holding some sort of document in her hands.
        <p></p>Mahiru determined that her mother had come home for some reason
        <p></p>connected to her job and knew that she mustn't get in her way. But still,
        <p></p>Mahiru was happy to see her after so long, and she did not pay close
        <p></p>attention to her mother's demeanor before talking to her.
        <p></p>"Um, while you were away, Mother, I worked very hard. I worked hard
        <p></p>on my tests, and my sports, and I got lots of first places!"
        <p></p>As she reported that she had made great efforts at her studies and
        <p></p>athletics while her parents were away, Mahiru grabbed the hem of her
        <p></p>mother's clothes with a smile…then her mother finally turned toward her.
        <p></p>It was the first time she had ever faced her mother directly.
        <p></p>Before then, she had seen her mother from a distance, or from behind,
        <p></p>but that was the first time her mother had been so close and so clearly
        <p></p>looking at her.
        <p></p>Mahiru had heard from Miss Koyuki that her mother's face did not
        <p></p>really resemble hers, and sure enough, the woman before her was beautiful,
        <p></p>but there was an unapproachable strength to her. If anything, Mahiru had
        <p></p>gentle features that resembled her father. Her mother was the exact opposite
        <p></p>of Mahiru. She was sharp and severe in every which way.
        <p></p>The woman reflected in Mahiru's eyes looked down at her own daughter
        <p></p>with a cold, unfeeling gaze and shook her off.
        <p></p>The movement wasn't that violent, since she was dealing with a child,
        <p></p>but the rejection was clear. Mahiru lost her balance and fell on her backside.
        <p></p>She looked up, overcome with surprise, but there wasn't the slightest bit
        <p></p>of warmth or concern in the woman's gaze.
        <p></p>Just when she thought she had finally gotten her mother to acknowledge
        <p></p>her existence, her mother looked at her as if she were a pebble by the side
        <p></p>of the road, and that was when Mahiru finally understood. She
        <p></p>unfortunately realized.
        <p></p>—I'm not wanted.
        <p></p>The nausea rising gradually inside her and the horrible pounding of her
        <p></p>heart stopped her from having any further thoughts.
        <p></p>But once that idea fully coalesced, it led the way to answers about all her
        <p></p>parents' actions to date, in rapid succession.
        <p></p>Why was she so neglected?
        <p></p>Why didn't her parents ever come home?
        <p></p>Why did her mother reject even her touch?
        <p></p>…I am not loved, and I am not wanted.
        <p></p>Her mother's gaze as she watched Mahiru realize all these things was all
        <p></p>the confirmation she needed.
        <p></p>…As far as Mother is concerned, I'm not needed.
        <p></p>Mahiru had put Miss Koyuki on the spot many times, asking her why
        <p></p>things were the way they were, but after seeing her mother like that, she had
        <p></p>been quick to figure it out.
        <p></p>She wasn't needed, so her mother hadn't taken care of her. She wasn't
        <p></p>wanted, so her mother hadn't looked after her. Her mother had given birth
        <p></p>to her, then abandoned all the duties and privileges of parenthood.
        <p></p>That was why her mother hardly ever showed her face at home and why
        <p></p>she passed right through, either not noticing or brushing Mahiru away even
        <p></p>when she reached out.
        <p></p>While Mahiru was still sitting there, grappling with the sudden
        <p></p>awareness of her unbelievably cruel reality, her mother left, and all Mahiru
        <p></p>could do was watch her go.
        <p></p>Too late, she reached out her hand, but it hung in the air and didn't grab
        <p></p>anything. Mahiru had nothing left. She had never had anything to begin
        <p></p>with.
        <p></p>She couldn't tell whether the drops spilling onto the floor were tears or
        <p></p>something seeping out from where her delicate heart had been mercilessly
        <p></p>gouged out of her chest.
        <p></p>The only thing she could say for certain was that she was not loved.
        <p></p>No matter how hard she worked, if she was not loved, no one would
        <p></p>ever notice her efforts, so they were meaningless.
        <p></p>"Why?"
        <p></p>As she spoke that question aloud, a violent, heartbreaking emotion
        <p></p>spilled out from inside her, and she sobbed loudly in her empty home.
        <p></p>She had stopped crying by the time Miss Koyuki came to the house. But she
        <p></p>couldn't muster her pure smiling face as she had before, not even for her
        <p></p>beloved Miss Koyuki. Something like resignation filled her body, and her
        <p></p>smile became stiff and drawn.
        <p></p>What if she rejects me?
        <p></p>If she had known nothing, Mahiru might have clung to Miss Koyuki and
        <p></p>cried.
        <p></p>But knowing that she was unloved by her own mother, Mahiru grew
        <p></p>scared. Miss Koyuki had always respected Mahiru and cherished her—she
        <p></p>was almost like a parent to her—but that was because it was her job.
        <p></p>Not even her own parents loved her, so there was no way that Miss
        <p></p>Koyuki loved her.
        <p></p>Mahiru knew that if she embraced Miss Koyuki, she was sure to ask.
        <p></p>She would ask if Miss Koyuki loved her.
        <p></p>Of course she doesn't.
        <p></p>Even though Mahiru's parents didn't love her, she didn't want to make
        <p></p>Miss Koyuki their substitute and was terrified of being rejected by her as
        <p></p>well.
        <p></p>Afraid to even check, Mahiru held back the concerned Miss Koyuki
        <p></p>with a meager smile and covered her chest to hide where it was sodden
        <p></p>from her tortured crying.
        <p></p>Mahiru was hurt by her mother's rejection, but even so, she didn't give up
        <p></p>on love completely.
        <p></p>She hung her hopes on the tiny possibility that if she became an even
        <p></p>better child, her mother might look her way.
        <p></p>Mahiru worked as hard as she could, more than ever before, hoping to
        <p></p>catch her mother's attention, wishing she would just glance at her.
        <p></p>She would have been happy with even one word of acknowledgment, a
        <p></p>single bit of praise.
        <p></p>That alone would have been reward enough for her efforts.
        <p></p>Ultimately, she did improve her schoolwork, and her athletics, and she
        <p></p>polished her appearance, but her parents never took notice.
        <p></p>Even though many people seemed to have a favorable impression of her,
        <p></p>even though she became an honor student, even though she grew into the
        <p></p>good looks she inherited from her parents, they never looked her way.
        <p></p>For what it was worth, whenever she saw her father, he would say two
        <p></p>or three awkward words to her, but that was all. He didn't really see
        <p></p>Mahiru, inside or out, and instead always averted his eyes guiltily.
        <p></p>He probably felt conflicted when he laid eyes on the girl who was born
        <p></p>out of one night's indiscretion in a marriage arranged for political reasons.
        <p></p>If they hate looking at me so much, they should have chosen not to have
        <p></p>me.
        <p></p>I never asked to be born.
        <p></p>How good it would have felt to be able to say those things out loud.
        <p></p>But by that time, Mahiru had mastered stifling her judgment and
        <p></p>emotions, and she said nothing. She simply swallowed her gloomiest
        <p></p>feelings and stuffed them deep down in her chest.
        <p></p>Even though her heart ought to have been clogged by a thick layer of
        <p></p>murky, stagnant emotions, instead it was empty, with a bitter wind howling
        <p></p>in the void.
        <p></p>It was cold, miserable, and painful.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't know what she could do to fill that hole in her heart.
        <p></p>Or rather, even though she knew what would fill it, she also understood
        <p></p>that it was something she couldn't have.
        <p></p>Love—such a short little word, but no matter how Mahiru tried, no
        <p></p>matter how she reached for it, she couldn't even see it, and her hands
        <p></p>always came away empty.
        <p></p>Even though she was a beautiful child, fit to be lauded as a model little
        <p></p>girl, she never got a scrap of love from her parents, something that other
        <p></p>children probably took for granted.
        <p></p>For better or worse, Mahiru clearly took after her parents, which everyone
        <p></p>seemed to regard as a good thing. And her efforts bore fruit as she added to
        <p></p>her skills and grew into a well-rounded, beautiful individual.
        <p></p>In the later years of elementary school, when the differences between the
        <p></p>boys and girls became apparent, she began to get constant attention from
        <p></p>the opposite sex.
        <p></p>By that time, she understood what she needed to do to win people's
        <p></p>favor and how to conduct herself so no one would hate her, and she
        <p></p>committed to behaving that way.
        <p></p>She molded herself into what most people would consider to be the ideal
        <p></p>girl: humble and unpretentious but refined and gentle enough that she
        <p></p>wouldn't be seen as groveling, treating everyone with kindness and
        <p></p>courtesy and never showing favoritism.
        <p></p>And with that, her angel persona came into being.
        <p></p>It was a warped part of her.
        <p></p>As a result of her solidifying into perfection on the surface, no one could
        <p></p>tell that on the inside, she was riddled with holes, and she grew into a young
        <p></p>woman whom everyone envied.
        <p></p>She lived an empty existence, never knowing love despite being adored.
        <p></p>Though she knew how hollow that was, Mahiru never stopped
        <p></p>improving herself.
        <p></p>Maybe she could fill her empty heart if everyone liked her.
        <p></p>Maybe she could get her parents' attention.
        <p></p>Maybe she could get them to actually understand her and love her.
        <p></p>Filled with those withered, fleeting hopes, she made these wishes to no
        <p></p>one in particular.
        <p></p>"There's no way that will happen."
        <p></p>That wasn't an answer that she received from someone else but rather
        <p></p>the answer that spilled forth from inside herself.
        <p></p>"Even when I try my hardest, neither Father nor Mother have ever
        <p></p>looked my way, have they?"
        <p></p>Her sneering voice echoed loudly in her ears, seeming to double back on
        <p></p>itself.
        <p></p>"I thought it would be all right if everyone liked me, but that turned out
        <p></p>to be wrong, didn't it? If they only like me for what I'm pretending to be,
        <p></p>I'll never get anyone to love the real me. The thing everyone likes is a mask
        <p></p>I've put on. I'm just strangling myself. No one sees me for who I am."
        <p></p>Having drawn this conclusion, Mahiru twisted up her face and laughed
        <p></p>—
        <p></p>Then Mahiru sensed warmth beside her and slowly opened her eyes.
        <p></p>A familiar, subdued scent was right beside her. When she looked toward
        <p></p>the warmth with wavering, unfocused eyes, she saw the body of a person
        <p></p>who had not been there a moment before.
        <p></p>She felt safe in the pleasant warmth and pressed her cheek against it…
        <p></p>Then she heard a quiet laugh.
        <p></p>"Good morning."
        <p></p>The smooth, gentle voice was just what Mahiru had been searching for.
        <p></p>She turned her face toward the source of the voice with sluggish
        <p></p>movements, and there was Amane, looking at her with a tender expression
        <p></p>and kindness in his eyes.
        <p></p>An instant later, Mahiru realized that she was leaning against Amane,
        <p></p>and she sat up in a hurry.
        <p></p>Amane had come home without her realizing it, and she had no idea
        <p></p>when she had drifted off.
        <p></p>"…D-did I fall asleep?" she asked timidly.
        <p></p>Amane nodded readily. "Sure did. When I got home about an hour ago,
        <p></p>you were asleep, so I decided not to wake you up, but after I sat down
        <p></p>beside you, you gradually fell over onto me, and I let you be."
        <p></p>"S-sorry. Not only did I let myself in while you weren't home, I
        <p></p>completely nodded off…"
        <p></p>"I really don't mind at all, but you do fall asleep a lot at my place, huh?"
        <p></p>"Agh—"
        <p></p>She couldn't deny that Amane's place was comfortable, or that she had a
        <p></p>tendency to fall asleep there. All she could do was groan quietly.
        <p></p>Mahiru had to admit he wasn't wrong.
        <p></p>The first time that Mahiru had dozed off during one of Shihoko's visits
        <p></p>had truly been an accident, but every time after that, it had been because she
        <p></p>trusted Amane and let her guard down around him.
        <p></p>It was unthinkable for Mahiru to fall asleep while anyone was beside
        <p></p>her, but Amane alone was special.
        <p></p>She liked him and felt at ease with him by her side; plus, she was
        <p></p>confident that Amane wouldn't try anything.
        <p></p>When he was next to her, she was calm, in spite of her heart pounding.
        <p></p>She figured that was the effect of Amane's measured intimacy and
        <p></p>reassuring presence.
        <p></p>He respected Mahiru and cherished her and looked out for her. That
        <p></p>confidence let her always feel safe and sound with him.
        <p></p>"I try to make this a place where you feel like you can really relax…
        <p></p>Though it didn't seem like you were able to sleep soundly this time."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"You were crying out a little in your sleep. Like you were having a bad
        <p></p>dream or something."
        <p></p>She had apparently let some words leak out while she slept. It must have
        <p></p>been the effect of remembering the past while she napped.
        <p></p>Mahiru wasn't sure how to explain it to Amane, who was looking at her
        <p></p>with concern in his eyes. All she could do was put on a vague smile.
        <p></p>"…Yes, I suppose you could say it was a bad dream."
        <p></p>"I see… Better not to ask?"
        <p></p>"I don't really mind you asking or anything…but I don't think it would
        <p></p>be very fun to hear. If anything, I think it would just make you
        <p></p>uncomfortable."
        <p></p>She had explained her upbringing to Amane before, so he wasn't much
        <p></p>of a fan of her parents. She hadn't told him any stories that would make him
        <p></p>like them, because she didn't have any.
        <p></p>Amane knew almost everything about her situation, and he couldn't help
        <p></p>but hold some not-so-nice feelings toward her parents. And Mahiru, when
        <p></p>she looked back now on her mother and father from an outsider's
        <p></p>perspective, recognized that they really were not good people.
        <p></p>…Even so, they did give birth to me, and more than anything, I wished
        <p></p>they would love me. I was just a child.
        <p></p>Unconditional love, at least, did not exist between Mahiru and her
        <p></p>parents.
        <p></p>All Mahiru had wanted was for them to acknowledge her, so she had
        <p></p>reached desperately toward them. If asked whether that was real love, she
        <p></p>would have to say no.
        <p></p>From the way that Mahiru hesitated, even Amane seemed to sort of
        <p></p>guess what kind of dream she had been having. He seemed rather unsure
        <p></p>how to proceed, so Mahiru smiled in response to his anxious expression.
        <p></p>"It's not that big of a deal, okay? I was just having a dream about how I
        <p></p>used to spend a lot of time waiting by myself. No one came home, and no
        <p></p>one paid attention to me. That's all."
        <p></p>No matter how long she waited, her parents never came home to
        <p></p>Mahiru. They never saw her for who she was. That was her dream of being
        <p></p>small.
        <p></p>"…Even though I tried hard, ultimately I was nothing more than a
        <p></p>product of circumstance. I thought they might pay attention to me if I was
        <p></p>outstanding, but instead, it gave them an excuse to avoid dealing with me,
        <p></p>and there was even less reason to see me. I understand that now."
        <p></p>After being brushed aside, she had tried to become an even better kid,
        <p></p>but that hadn't helped. Acting out and causing a little bit of trouble for her
        <p></p>parents probably would have gotten her more attention. There wouldn't
        <p></p>have been the slightest bit of love there, though.
        <p></p>It was too late for all of that, and now that Mahiru had reached her
        <p></p>current age, she no longer sought love from her parents, so she no longer
        <p></p>thought about ways to get it. But she often considered the unanswerable
        <p></p>question of how her future might have been different if she had behaved
        <p></p>differently in the past.
        <p></p>As she laughed quietly at herself for pondering pointless what-ifs, a
        <p></p>strong, sturdy hand plopped down on top of Mahiru's head.
        <p></p>She turned her gaze toward Amane, wondering what made him do that
        <p></p>all of a sudden, and saw him frowning in obvious vexation, his expression
        <p></p>wavering in a look of regret.
        <p></p>"…I'm sorry. For making you feel lonely."
        <p></p>"Why are you apologizing, Amane? I let myself in here without asking
        <p></p>and decided to wait for you, that's all. And I had that dream all on my
        <p></p>own."
        <p></p>"I didn't tell you that I was going out, even though I knew there was a
        <p></p>chance you would come by my place. You waited so long that you fell
        <p></p>asleep, right? I'm sure you got tired of waiting."
        <p></p>After he said that, Amane lowered his eyes for a moment, then looked
        <p></p>directly at Mahiru.
        <p></p>"…I see you for who you are, and I'll always come home to you,
        <p></p>Mahiru."
        <p></p>His voice wasn't loud, but it was very powerful and sincere.
        <p></p>Under his honest, heartfelt gaze, Mahiru felt her eyes start to fill with
        <p></p>tears, but she held them back and slowly put on a smile.
        <p></p>—That must be why I fell in love with this person.
        <p></p>He was a little guarded, but he was gentle and compassionate and
        <p></p>always looked directly at Mahiru. He accepted every part of her, from her
        <p></p>glossy exterior to her vulnerable inner self. He truly cherished her.
        <p></p>How could I help falling in love with someone like this? Seems
        <p></p>impossible.
        <p></p>"…Those words sound an awful lot like a proposal, you know?" she said
        <p></p>softly in an attempt to district him from the fact that she was about to cry.
        <p></p>"P-p-pro—?! That's not what I meant at all!"
        <p></p>Once Amane realized that his words could be taken that way, his face
        <p></p>flushed red faster than an instant water heater, and he waved his hand in
        <p></p>front of him.
        <p></p>It stung a bit to hear him deny it so strongly, but she knew that Amane
        <p></p>hadn't meant that when he said it, so she swallowed the pain immediately.
        <p></p>"I know that; it was a joke… But it sounds like I've become something
        <p></p>for you to come home to, Amane?"
        <p></p>"…And for you, Mahiru, it seems like my house is where you like to
        <p></p>come."
        <p></p>Maybe he'd thought she was teasing him, because his voice turned quite
        <p></p>sulky, but she thought it was sweet and cracked a smile, blushing at
        <p></p>Amane's words.
        <p></p>Sure enough, Mahiru now almost always went "home" to Amane's
        <p></p>place.
        <p></p>Whenever she was alone in her own apartment, that was when she felt
        <p></p>really lonely.
        <p></p>Even though she had thought that she was used to it, she had started
        <p></p>feeling the loneliness again after meeting Amane—or perhaps thanks to
        <p></p>meeting him.
        <p></p>If she had to say, she guessed it was the latter.
        <p></p>Mahiru had met Amane and felt fulfilled for the first time.
        <p></p>She had learned the joy of having a conversation with someone on an
        <p></p>equal footing. She had learned the warmth of having someone beside her.
        <p></p>She had learned the pleasure of spending quiet time together. She had
        <p></p>learned the true meaning of loving someone.
        <p></p>By spending time with Amane, her hollow interior had become packed
        <p></p>full with these things before she knew it.
        <p></p>"That's right, because I already know my way around your place just
        <p></p>like it was my own home."
        <p></p>"You seem to know it better than I do."
        <p></p>"That's because you're always forgetting where things are."
        <p></p>"Oh, hush."
        <p></p>She poked fun at him to hide her own embarrassment, and Amane
        <p></p>turned away.
        <p></p>She said he had trouble remembering, but she knew that was because he
        <p></p>had been making adjustments for her sake. Amane had moved the things
        <p></p>she used into places where she could reach them easily and out of the spots
        <p></p>where he normally kept them.
        <p></p>Previously, even daily-use items had been stored up high, and now they
        <p></p>had been moved, one by one, into spots that were convenient for Mahiru,
        <p></p>since she wasn't all that tall.
        <p></p>On top of all that, Amane had prepared spots for Mahiru to leave her
        <p></p>personal items. From her blanket and toothbrush, to her grooming tools, to
        <p></p>dishes, and even a complete set of study materials…her personal effects had
        <p></p>rapidly multiplied.
        <p></p>Bit by bit, ever since they met, this apartment had been changing to
        <p></p>accommodate Mahiru.
        <p></p>As if Amane was trying to say You can be here; this is where you
        <p></p>belong.
        <p></p>"…I'd rather—"
        <p></p>"Rather what?"
        <p></p>"…Nothing."
        <p></p>If only I could stay here by your side forever.
        <p></p>But the words wouldn't come out.
        <p></p>They weren't that close yet, and she knew Amane would have no idea
        <p></p>how to react if she said something like that. Even clingy girls have their
        <p></p>limits.
        <p></p>But that was how much trust and affection she had for Amane.
        <p></p>How happy she would be if they could live a peaceful, warm life
        <p></p>together.
        <p></p>"…I'm a greedy person, you know."
        <p></p>"I don't know what kind of criteria you're using, Mahiru, but if you're
        <p></p>greedy, then I'm in trouble because I must be absolutely insatiable."
        <p></p>"That's a joke, right? You almost never ask for anything from anyone. If
        <p></p>anything, you're quite reserved and very considerate of other people's
        <p></p>needs."
        <p></p>"Not at all! Just now, I was worrying over making a request of you."
        <p></p>"Oh-ho, a request for what?"
        <p></p>He approached the request with such gentleness that she decided to grant
        <p></p>whatever it was, even if it took a little work. If he desired something from
        <p></p>Mahiru, she wanted to give it to him.
        <p></p>When she looked at Amane to see what he wanted, his eyes were darting
        <p></p>around as though he was finding the request hard to articulate, but he
        <p></p>steeled himself, and his black eyes focused firmly on Mahiru.
        <p></p>"If you're having a hard time, lean on me."
        <p></p>His firm request wasn't exactly a desire, nor was it an ordinary
        <p></p>suggestion.
        <p></p>But she understood what Amane was thinking and why he had said
        <p></p>those words. How lucky I am, she thought as her face twisted into a smile. It
        <p></p>wasn't elegant, but it was her genuine, heartfelt smile.
        <p></p>"…Well then, will you indulge me?" she asked.
        <p></p>"Sure, ask away. Anything you want, as long as I can do it," Amane said
        <p></p>with a composed expression on his face.
        <p></p>Mahiru wavered for a moment…then informed him, "In that case, I
        <p></p>won't hold back," before tipping over to lay her head on Amane's lap where
        <p></p>he sat beside her.
        <p></p>Looking up at the ceiling, she could see Amane, who had stiffened,
        <p></p>probably because she had caught him by surprise. She ignored her own
        <p></p>feelings of embarrassment and laughed.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"This seemed to soothe you before when you did it, so I thought maybe
        <p></p>it could soothe me, too. I wanted to try it once."
        <p></p>"Is lying in a guy's lap all that soothing?"
        <p></p>"Well, it wouldn't be very comfortable for a nap."
        <p></p>"Sorry."
        <p></p>"But it is nice and cozy."
        <p></p>"…If you say so."
        <p></p>As she probably could have expected, his muscular male thighs were a
        <p></p>bit hard for a pillow, but she felt strongly connected with Amane, and his
        <p></p>warmth and characteristic smell seeped over her, dissolving her quiet
        <p></p>tension.
        <p></p>Amane was the only person she wanted to touch her and spoil her like
        <p></p>that.
        <p></p>"…Could I stay like this, just for a little while?"
        <p></p>"As you wish, my lady."
        <p></p>She grew worried that her actions had indeed been reckless, and when
        <p></p>she looked up, Amane's face was flushed slightly red, but he didn't look
        <p></p>uncomfortable. With awkward but courteous hand movements, he started
        <p></p>stroking her head.
        <p></p>His hands were the ones that grabbed her tightly and pulled her back
        <p></p>when she was in danger of going astray; they were the hands that embraced
        <p></p>her when things were hard and she wanted to cry, the hands that stroked her
        <p></p>to soothe and to spoil.
        <p></p>Under the touch of those firm hands, she became very relaxed, and their
        <p></p>pleasant touch caused her mouth to soften into a smile.
        <p></p>"…Amane?"
        <p></p>"Hmm?"
        <p></p>"…Thank you very much."
        <p></p>"For what?"
        <p></p>Amane looked away, as if he didn't want to admit he had been worried
        <p></p>about her, so Mahiru pretended not to see that Amane was blushing. She
        <p></p>turned over to face away from him, so as not to expose the fact that her own
        <p></p>face was turning red with embarrassment.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 75: A Careless Angel 
        <p></p>Mahiru's behavior was very different around people she was close to
        <p></p>compared with how she was around strangers.
        <p></p>Only people who knew her well could see that.
        <p></p>She wasn't cold to people that she didn't know very well, and in fact she
        <p></p>treated most everyone amicably and politely. But although she was friendly
        <p></p>on the surface, underneath she was highly cautious and never showed the
        <p></p>slightest opening to anyone. It was as though she erected a wall so that no
        <p></p>one could get close to her and learn the truth.
        <p></p>On the other hand, once she opened up to someone, she became
        <p></p>extremely generous toward them, fawning over them and availing herself of
        <p></p>their kindness. That was the Mahiru that people got to know once they
        <p></p>became close to her.
        <p></p>Basically, she was never on guard around her friends, and she showed
        <p></p>them her sweet side once she trusted them. It made her vulnerable, in a way
        <p></p>that some people would describe as careless.
        <p></p>For example, once Mahiru got used to someone, she had no problem
        <p></p>getting physically close to them.
        <p></p>"…This model is about the same height as you, Amane, so it's easy to
        <p></p>imagine what you would look like in these clothes, isn't it?"
        <p></p>When she had first been getting to know Amane, she had left space
        <p></p>between them on the sofa as a matter of course. It would have been
        <p></p>unthinkable to sit so close that they could touch.
        <p></p>So much for that.
        <p></p>Now Mahiru took a seat beside Amane where he sat on the sofa and
        <p></p>seemed truly relaxed as she peeked over at the fashion magazine that he
        <p></p>was reading.
        <p></p>She almost melted into him, as if she didn't have the slightest concern
        <p></p>that he might do anything.
        <p></p>This brought with it a host of problems.
        <p></p>Amane was holding an ordinary fashion magazine, so there wasn't any
        <p></p>particular problem with her reading it. But since they were looking at the
        <p></p>magazine together, it was inevitable that she would bring her body close to
        <p></p>his and lean against his arm.
        <p></p>He knew that she wasn't doing it on purpose, but from time to time,
        <p></p>something soft and squishy would assert itself against his arm and make
        <p></p>things difficult.
        <p></p>Its owner didn't seem to have the slightest idea that it was touching him,
        <p></p>as she looked up at him bashfully and pointed at the male model, saying, "I
        <p></p>bet these clothes would look good on you, Amane."
        <p></p>He found himself having to bite sharply down on the inside of his cheek
        <p></p>to bear it each time.
        <p></p>Even though he didn't consider himself to be someone with overly
        <p></p>strong desires in that department, the situation was shaving away at his
        <p></p>willpower.
        <p></p>…I wish she would be a little more vigilant about certain things.
        <p></p>Even if Mahiru was more self-aware, Amane knew that she wouldn't
        <p></p>treat him with suspicion, but still, he wondered if she couldn't stand to be
        <p></p>just a little more guarded.
        <p></p>The way she didn't worry about him at all made him wonder if she even
        <p></p>saw him as a man.
        <p></p>"…Amane, there's obviously something on your mind. Is something the
        <p></p>matter?"
        <p></p>Mahiru tilted her head in puzzlement, not the least bit aware that she
        <p></p>herself was the cause of his vexation, so Amane caught himself before he
        <p></p>could say, "Whose fault do you think that is…?" and tried to evade the
        <p></p>question.
        <p></p>"It's nothing, really," he answered.
        <p></p>His voice was especially curt, even for him. By the time he realized it,
        <p></p>Mahiru had cast her eyes downward dejectedly.
        <p></p>"W-wait, I'm not mad or anything!" He stroked her head in a panic,
        <p></p>rushing to soothe her. "I was just thinking about something…"
        <p></p>"…Are you sure?"
        <p></p>He reassured her as he gently stroked her head, and the look in Mahiru's
        <p></p>eyes softened in relief. Amane also felt relieved as he enjoyed the softness
        <p></p>of her hair, running his hands through it carefully.
        <p></p>He had only realized it recently, but Mahiru seemed to like having her
        <p></p>head stroked.
        <p></p>Really, he knew that it wasn't appropriate for him to thoughtlessly lay
        <p></p>hands on a girl he wasn't actually dating and that girls didn't like it when
        <p></p>boys they weren't attracted to touched their hair. But Mahiru always seemed
        <p></p>quite pleased by it and showed no resistance, so against his better judgment,
        <p></p>he allowed himself to touch her.
        <p></p>He figured it was a good thing, since she would have stopped him if she
        <p></p>disliked it.
        <p></p>He also knew that she let her guard down because she trusted him.
        <p></p>…She really lets me get away with a lot.
        <p></p>Mahiru was always naive around Amane, and she never stopped him
        <p></p>from touching her.
        <p></p>In fact, she seemed delighted by physical contact with him and
        <p></p>sometimes practically encouraged him to touch her.
        <p></p>If she's not a little more cautious, I might just lose control.
        <p></p>He had a feeling he might come on too strong one day if she kept being
        <p></p>so careless. Of course, he didn't want to force himself on her or make her
        <p></p>hate him, and that logic always won out, but he felt that his willpower was
        <p></p>gradually being worn away, and he feared the day when he would give
        <p></p>himself over to his urges might be coming.
        <p></p>Even though he didn't want to hurt her, Amane worried that his male
        <p></p>instincts might overwhelm the warnings from his rational mind and he
        <p></p>might find himself grabbing at her.
        <p></p>He wanted to cherish her and to keep her happy. Making her cry was out
        <p></p>of the question.
        <p></p>Even though he understood that, from time to time, the impulse to take
        <p></p>hold of Mahiru reared its ugly head. To embrace her soft body, and run his
        <p></p>hands over her smooth skin, and taste her little lips to his heart's content.
        <p></p>Many times, he had wallowed in self-loathing for succumbing to
        <p></p>ridiculous fantasies. Every time, he scolded and scorned himself for his
        <p></p>rudeness and his betrayal of Mahiru's trust in him.
        <p></p>Rightfully, it should have been Amane maintaining the distance between
        <p></p>them so that nothing like that could possibly happen, but—
        <p></p>"…It's impossible, at this point."
        <p></p>"What is?"
        <p></p>Mahiru asked him a question in return, still wearing a soft, buoyant
        <p></p>expression.
        <p></p>Amane averted his eyes a little and replied, "Nothing."
        <p></p>He loved Mahiru far too much now to ever think of parting from her, so
        <p></p>he pretended not to hear the faint alarm bells ringing in his head and stroked
        <p></p>Mahiru's hair again.

        <p></p>Chapter 76: Only Bad Kids Stay Up All Night 
        <p></p>"The best time to see the Lyrids meteor shower would be sometime starting
        <p></p>late tonight, and it should continue into tomorrow morning—"
        <p></p>The news came from the television, which they sometimes left on during
        <p></p>dinner, and Amane swallowed the food he was chewing and made an
        <p></p>interested sound. "Oh?"
        <p></p>Amane had never been the type to watch much television, and if he did
        <p></p>have the television on, he was either playing a game, watching some variety
        <p></p>show, or viewing a news program that succinctly reported on the events of
        <p></p>the day.
        <p></p>Since he tended to get most of his news from browsing social media
        <p></p>sites, which were the noisiest places on the web, he hadn't heard about the
        <p></p>meteors until that day.
        <p></p>"A meteor shower?"
        <p></p>"People have been talking about it for a while—," Mahiru replied,
        <p></p>giving Amane a look of subtle exasperation.
        <p></p>He sipped his miso soup with a look of feigned ignorance on his face.
        <p></p>Delicious today as always, he thought earnestly, and looked up at Mahiru.
        <p></p>Sure enough, that look of slight exasperation was still trained on him.
        <p></p>He just sighed quietly, as if he didn't intend to say anything more on the
        <p></p>matter.
        <p></p>"Anyway," Mahiru explained, "this one doesn't have quite as many
        <p></p>meteors, compared to the other meteor showers in the big three, but since
        <p></p>the weather will be pretty good and it will be easy to watch outside, the
        <p></p>members of the astronomy club are apparently having a meteor shower
        <p></p>observation party as a club activity."
        <p></p>"Come to think of it, I feel like I might have heard the astronomy club
        <p></p>members in our class talking about something like that."
        <p></p>It wasn't really polite to eavesdrop on other people's conversations, and
        <p></p>anyway the classmates he wasn't friendly with were basically strangers.
        <p></p>Amane didn't have any interest in what they were saying, so even when he
        <p></p>did overhear something, he let it wash right over him like white noise.
        <p></p>As a result, he lost many opportunities to find common ground with
        <p></p>other people. This was something about himself that he recognized was not
        <p></p>good. He didn't have much inclination to fix it, though.
        <p></p>"Amane, you tend to ignore anything that doesn't concern you, don't
        <p></p>you? When you're talking to someone, and they bring up something that's
        <p></p>on their mind, that's an opportunity to make a real connection. So if you
        <p></p>pay a little more attention, things will be easier for you in the future."
        <p></p>"I'm just not that interested in other people. I'm perfectly happy with
        <p></p>just you, Itsuki, Chitose, and Kadowaki."
        <p></p>If the meteor had been something Mahiru, Itsuki, or even Chitose had
        <p></p>mentioned, he probably would have remembered every detail, but
        <p></p>predictably, when it came to people he didn't know, he only barely listened
        <p></p>to their conversation and then promptly forgot it.
        <p></p>"Well, if nothing else, that's very like you."
        <p></p>"I just don't want to get that involved with strangers, I guess. I'm not the
        <p></p>type to make lots of friends. I'm happy with fewer, deeper friendships."
        <p></p>"That's because your circle of friends is small, Amane. Mine is wide and
        <p></p>shallow, with an oceanic trench in the very center."
        <p></p>"Oceanic trench?"
        <p></p>"It means that the people I develop deep relationships with are special."
        <p></p>Mahiru gave him a slightly impish smile, and Amane wondered whether
        <p></p>he made the cut as one of those special people, but he couldn't bring
        <p></p>himself to ask.
        <p></p>If it wasn't so conceited, he would assume he occupied pretty much the
        <p></p>most intimate position at the center of Mahiru's circle of friends. He was
        <p></p>unsure whether he was the one who was closest to her, but she did let her
        <p></p>guard down around him and spoiled him from time to time, so he figured he
        <p></p>made the cut as one of those special people.
        <p></p>Thinking about it made him kind of embarrassed, so he took another sip
        <p></p>of miso soup to try to hide it.
        <p></p>Information about the best place and time to observe the meteors was
        <p></p>coming from the television.
        <p></p>According to the TV, the region where Amane and Mahiru lived was
        <p></p>part of the best viewing area. Weather-wise, it was predicted there wouldn't
        <p></p>be a cloud in the sky, so conditions for observing the meteor shower were
        <p></p>likely to be ideal.
        <p></p>They were set up for such favorable conditions that Amane too started
        <p></p>thinking that it might be nice to observe the event, at least for a little while.
        <p></p>"It might be interesting to watch the shooting stars now and then, huh?"
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, it is a rare opportunity. The weather has a funny tendency to
        <p></p>be bad on the days of the biggest meteor showers."
        <p></p>"I suppose there's never a guarantee that it'll be clear skies just because
        <p></p>there's a meteor shower."
        <p></p>"That's right. Which is why tonight is perfect."
        <p></p>"…But it's late, huh? I don't care about being sleepy today, but I'm
        <p></p>afraid of how it might hit me tomorrow. We don't have gym class
        <p></p>tomorrow, so I might be able to get by just staring out the window, but…"
        <p></p>Naturally, staying up all night the day before they had gym class,
        <p></p>especially long distance running, would result in a rough time and Amane
        <p></p>would have never considered taking on such obvious hardship. But if it was
        <p></p>just a normal day in the classroom, staying up until two or three in the
        <p></p>morning didn't seem too bad.
        <p></p>He had always been the type of person who was fine with less sleep. It
        <p></p>wasn't as if he always went to sleep late, but he had no problem staying up
        <p></p>a little for a chance like this one.
        <p></p>If possible, he would have liked to observe from a wide-open place like
        <p></p>the park, but it was dangerous to go out walking at night, and if something
        <p></p>happened, they might even be detained by the police, so they would have to
        <p></p>enjoy the meteor shower from home. Out on the balcony would be best.
        <p></p>Even so, they wouldn't have any difficulty observing the night sky, so
        <p></p>that was the plan.
        <p></p>With that decided, Amane started thinking about the tasks ahead of them
        <p></p>that they needed to get through to finish their schoolwork and complete
        <p></p>their daily routines, when Mahiru made an uneasy, anxious expression.
        <p></p>"…Is something the matter?"
        <p></p>"No, I want to see the meteors, too, but…I was thinking about what to
        <p></p>do."
        <p></p>"Because staying up late is the enemy of healthy skin?"
        <p></p>She kept a consistent routine and was more serious about her appearance
        <p></p>than most people. Basic skin care dictates that the skin is restored during
        <p></p>sleep, so Mahiru never failed to get enough rest.
        <p></p>"Well, there's that too, but…um, isn't it preferable to observe meteor
        <p></p>showers in places where there's no light around?"
        <p></p>"Well yeah, that's true."
        <p></p>Everyone had heard before that the starry night sky looked more
        <p></p>beautiful in the countryside than in the city.
        <p></p>Because of air pollution—and, more importantly, the light pollution in
        <p></p>the city—it was easier to make out the twinkling of the stars away from the
        <p></p>dense population centers.
        <p></p>Illuminating the black of night was a normal sign of human activity. But
        <p></p>that artificial brilliance obstructed the natural light that celestial bodies gave
        <p></p>off as they burned their lives away.
        <p></p>It made sense that if there were artificial lights nearby, to the human eye,
        <p></p>the brilliance of the stars would seem diminished.
        <p></p>"…I, um, you'll probably think this is childish, but I can't really handle
        <p></p>being alone in the pitch-dark."
        <p></p>Mahiru chose her words carefully and mumbled them with some
        <p></p>hesitation before putting on an anxious smile.
        <p></p>"I'm fine when I'm sleeping, but…well, just sitting there waiting, not so
        <p></p>much. There's a buzz in my chest, like I can't calm down, so—"
        <p></p>Mahiru cast her eyes downward a little and trailed off, her voice
        <p></p>becoming gradually quieter. Then she must have noticed that Amane was
        <p></p>staring at her, because she rushed to raise her head and put on a courageous
        <p></p>smile.
        <p></p>It was obvious to Amane, who had been spending a lot of time with her,
        <p></p>that Mahiru was bluffing.
        <p></p>"After all, the official account for the observatory puts their broadcast
        <p></p>archive up on video sites, so maybe I'll just watch that."
        <p></p>"…You don't want to be alone?"
        <p></p>"Well, it's… I'll get lonely, is all."
        <p></p>She didn't use the word afraid, but she looked as if she was kind of
        <p></p>frightened and was trying not to show it.
        <p></p>Even Amane wasn't complacent enough to ignore it when he saw her in
        <p></p>that state.
        <p></p>"…Want to come watch it here?"
        <p></p>"Ah—"
        <p></p>"I'm planning to stay up tonight, so if you want to come to my place and
        <p></p>watch it together, I really don't mind."
        <p></p>They were both staying up for the same purpose, so he saw no issue with
        <p></p>watching the meteor shower together. And they were always hanging out at
        <p></p>his place anyway, and spending time alone together, so it was probably no
        <p></p>big deal, he thought, as his gaze slid over to Mahiru, but—Mahiru's eyes
        <p></p>disappeared and reappeared behind the curtain of her eyelashes several
        <p></p>times as she blinked in obvious surprise.
        <p></p>Amane wondered why she would be so surprised, then in the next
        <p></p>moment, he realized what was wrong, and a gasp escaped his mouth.
        <p></p>It's obvious that a boy and a girl being alone together in the middle of
        <p></p>the night is no good, isn't it?!
        <p></p>It had become so natural to have Mahiru around that he had made the
        <p></p>suggestion even though common sense dictated that it wasn't a good idea
        <p></p>for two people of the opposite sex who weren't in a serious relationship to
        <p></p>be spending time together late at night like that.
        <p></p>Obviously Amane had no bad intentions, but it was still true that he had
        <p></p>said something that sounded suspicious, depending on how she took it.
        <p></p>Of course Mahiru would be shocked.
        <p></p>"W-wait, I don't mean anything shameful by that, okay?! It's, I just… I
        <p></p>thought that maybe you could stay up to watch the meteors if you had
        <p></p>somebody with you, and that maybe we could watch them together, that's
        <p></p>all."
        <p></p>"…Would it be okay for me to be here?"
        <p></p>She looked at him, wide-eyed with hope, and yet when she said that,
        <p></p>Amane was the one who felt a sense of impending danger.
        <p></p>"Uh, th-that's my line… You're supposed to think it's dangerous."
        <p></p>"If you were really a dangerous person, you wouldn't warn me
        <p></p>beforehand."
        <p></p>"…That may be true, but you should still be careful."
        <p></p>"I am being careful!"
        <p></p>Even though he thought she was definitely lying, the most important
        <p></p>thing to Amane was that Mahiru's expression had brightened. Somehow or
        <p></p>other, the bad thoughts had been washed out of her mind, and that had to be
        <p></p>a good thing.
        <p></p>For Amane's part, he was the one who had invited her, and he had no
        <p></p>intention of doing anything, so as long as he could keep ahold of himself,
        <p></p>there should be no problem. That was what he decided.
        <p></p>"…So um, after we eat dinner, I'll just…go home for a bit. And come
        <p></p>back after I'm done having my bath and changing clothes and stuff, so…"
        <p></p>"S-sure. I'll go ahead and get ready for bed, too."
        <p></p>It seemed that in Mahiru's mind, the fact that she was coming over was
        <p></p>settled.
        <p></p>She seemed relieved, and a soft smile spread over her face, revealing a
        <p></p>sense of security and feelings of happiness. Amane let his eyes start to drift
        <p></p>around the room.
        <p></p>"I'm looking forward to it, to the shooting stars," she said in a tone of
        <p></p>voice that was sweet and a little lively.
        <p></p>"Me too," Amane managed to answer, before taking another sip of his
        <p></p>rapidly disappearing miso soup to hide his embarrassment again.
        <p></p>"I'm coming in."
        <p></p>Just as she'd said she would, Mahiru went home once, then returned
        <p></p>timidly to Amane's place before midnight.
        <p></p>Typical Mahiru, she must have understood that it would be a big issue
        <p></p>for her to come in her nightclothes, because she was dressed in casual
        <p></p>clothing instead. Her hair was in a single loose braid, and she was wearing a
        <p></p>flowy cream-colored dress.
        <p></p>Amane was sure she wouldn't have dared, but he'd nevertheless
        <p></p>prepared himself to make an about-face if she had shown up in her
        <p></p>nightclothes. He was relieved that wasn't the case, but even so, she did look
        <p></p>somehow different than usual, which he chalked up to the fact that it was an
        <p></p>unusual time of night for her to be there.
        <p></p>He got flustered just going to the door to greet her and was worried she
        <p></p>might think he was acting strange. But whether or not Mahiru noticed
        <p></p>Amane's agitation, she just put on a gentle smile.
        <p></p>"…Um, the meteor shower is going to reach its peak quite late at night,
        <p></p>so I'm sure it's going to be hard to stay up until then… You'll be here for
        <p></p>several hours. Is that all right?"
        <p></p>"Yep. Thanks for having me."
        <p></p>Mahiru bowed her head politely and followed right behind Amane as he
        <p></p>invited her in. Together they went into the living room.
        <p></p>Amane had gone ahead and moved the low table to make space by the
        <p></p>window, so that observation would be easier, and had laid out Mahiru's
        <p></p>favorite cushions.
        <p></p>He had considered dragging the beanbag that she loved so much out
        <p></p>from his bedroom, but if they weren't careful, sinking down into the
        <p></p>beanbag could mean falling asleep and defeating the whole purpose of the
        <p></p>evening, so he had decided not to bring it out.
        <p></p>He had also readied a small blanket for a lap warmer, but Mahiru was
        <p></p>somewhat lightly dressed, so he draped a large sweatshirt that he had also
        <p></p>laid out over her shoulders, then sat down beside her.
        <p></p>"You thought of everything, didn't you?"
        <p></p>"…Normally, you're the one who does that, so I thought that at least for
        <p></p>something like this, I should make sure that everything was ready."
        <p></p>Smirking at her lack of confidence in his preparations, Amane turned the
        <p></p>lights down with a remote control, and Mahiru shivered slightly.
        <p></p>"Sorry, I should have said something before I turned the lights off, huh?"
        <p></p>"No…I was just a little startled, it's fine."
        <p></p>As she said that, Amane decided it was best not to point out that her
        <p></p>fingertips were grasping lightly at the hem of his sweatshirt.
        <p></p>Without saying a word, Amane scooted just a little bit closer to Mahiru,
        <p></p>trying to do it in a way that seemed natural, and then quietly turned his gaze
        <p></p>out the window.
        <p></p>He wasn't normally aware of it, but when he looked up at the sky again,
        <p></p>he noticed its marvelous hues—a little bit of blue and purple mixed into
        <p></p>almost-black navy blue, clear yet mysteriously impenetrable.
        <p></p>It was a peaceful color, which seemed to set off the sparkle of the inlaid
        <p></p>stars all the more.
        <p></p>The sky looked more beautiful than usual that night, and the small
        <p></p>specks of light adorning it seemed to twinkle more intensely.
        <p></p>"So beautiful," Amane mouthed noiselessly. He glanced sidelong at
        <p></p>Mahiru and saw her looking silently at the sky beyond the window.
        <p></p>The moonlight illuminated her, tracing the contours of her graceful
        <p></p>silhouette.
        <p></p>Her long eyelashes seemed to glow slightly in the faint light, but it
        <p></p>might have been his imagination, a trick Amane's eyes were playing on him
        <p></p>as he looked at the girl he loved.
        <p></p>The only thing he knew for sure was that the Mahiru sitting beside him
        <p></p>was somehow different than usual. She looked ethereal, almost diaphanous,
        <p></p>and she emanated a bewitching charm.
        <p></p>"…It's so pretty. I haven't spotted any shooting stars yet, but even just
        <p></p>like this, I think it's a perfectly wonderful sight."
        <p></p>She seemed to notice him looking at her and turned to face Amane with
        <p></p>a faint smile. That was the exact moment Amane realized that he had
        <p></p>forgotten himself for a second. He nodded, flustered. "It sure is. I've never
        <p></p>sat quietly and looked up at the stars in the middle of the night like this
        <p></p>before, so it's a wonderfully novel experience."
        <p></p>"Settling in to watch the stars seems so simple, but it's something we
        <p></p>almost never do in modern society, where life is so rushed."
        <p></p>"You're right. And it's too bad that it's kind of hard to see the stars from
        <p></p>here. If we were at my parents' house, we could spread a tarp out in the
        <p></p>yard and lie down to watch. The stars would be easier to see than they are
        <p></p>here."
        <p></p>Amane's parents' house was located in an area with less traffic and
        <p></p>fewer artificial lights, so the stars were clearly visible.
        <p></p>Their garden was also fairly large and well-maintained, so it would have
        <p></p>been possible to spread out a tarp and observe the sky. Amane recalled
        <p></p>lying out there with his parents to stargaze when he was small, though never
        <p></p>for a meteor shower, and he smiled slightly at the nostalgic memory.
        <p></p>"Oh yes, I can only imagine; that would be wonderful."
        <p></p>"Well, it's out in the countryside, not like this place. The landscape
        <p></p>around it is beautiful, too."
        <p></p>"How nice. Growing up, I lived in the penthouse of a condo building, so
        <p></p>the night sky did look pretty from there, but…I'm sure it must be much
        <p></p>prettier seeing it from your house, Amane."
        <p></p>Amane had no idea how to respond to that. Mahiru chuckled quietly and
        <p></p>calmly shifted her gaze back out the window.
        <p></p>There was a look in her eyes as if she was gazing at some place far, far
        <p></p>away.
        <p></p>"Now the stars look so much prettier than they used to."
        <p></p>"…Oh?"
        <p></p>After somehow managing that little answer, Amane said nothing further
        <p></p>and looked up at the sky just as Mahiru was doing.
        <p></p>He thought about suggesting they go out on the balcony, but he didn't
        <p></p>want to move now that Mahiru was by his side, so he just quietly gazed up
        <p></p>at the starry sky.
        <p></p>The sky, full of glittering ancient lights just now reaching the Earth, told
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru nothing. It just twinkled faintly, illuminating the dark,
        <p></p>peaceful night.
        <p></p>Silence, heavy with a curious yet pleasant feeling of tension, filled the
        <p></p>room.
        <p></p>The only thing audible was the sound of their breathing and the rustling
        <p></p>of their clothes. Somewhere far away, a car alarm briefly sounded.
        <p></p>Neither of them knew how much time passed as they sat there like that.
        <p></p>Mahiru let out a little gasp in a childish voice, not quite managing to say
        <p></p>an actual word.
        <p></p>When Amane reflexively looked over at her, he saw her gaze gliding
        <p></p>across the sky, her clear eyes seeming to chase after something.
        <p></p>He stared, engrossed, at her face and eyes, sparkling as beautifully as
        <p></p>any star—then a moment too late, he realized that she had found a shooting
        <p></p>star.
        <p></p>Amane hurriedly turned toward the window, but the life span of a
        <p></p>meteor is short, and it had already burned out.
        <p></p>Chiding himself for missing it, he contented himself with the thought
        <p></p>that he had seen something even more beautiful.
        <p></p>"…Did you wish for something?"
        <p></p>"Don't you think it has a better chance of coming true if I don't tell
        <p></p>you?"
        <p></p>"Is that how it works?"
        <p></p>"In any case, what I wished for just then was…less of a wish, more like
        <p></p>a prayer, or an oath, so…"
        <p></p>So it's a secret.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked bashful for a moment, then stared straight at Amane.
        <p></p>"So then what did you wish for, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Uh…well, I, nothing really."
        <p></p>There was no way he could tell Mahiru he had been distracted looking at
        <p></p>her, so he tried to avoid the question with a vague answer, but apparently
        <p></p>his scheme was transparent.
        <p></p>"You weren't really watching, were you?" Mahiru smiled knowingly.
        <p></p>"Uh…I'll get a good look at the next one."
        <p></p>"He-he, make sure you do."
        <p></p>Mahiru laughed with her hand covering her mouth, then turned her gaze
        <p></p>out the window again.
        <p></p>Amane was intently watching the sky so that Mahiru wouldn't have a
        <p></p>reason to tease him again, when he noticed her shivering.
        <p></p>Though it was spring, the night was chilly, so they had the heater on. But
        <p></p>Amane's sense of cold and Mahiru's were different. Mahiru always had a
        <p></p>lower body temperature, so she probably wasn't warm enough with just a
        <p></p>sweatshirt and a blanket.
        <p></p>Amane peered stealthily at Mahiru's face, worried that he had been
        <p></p>insufficiently prepared after all, and he must have startled her, because her
        <p></p>eyes widened.
        <p></p>"…Aren't you cold?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"No. You lent me your jacket, so I'm fine… It's big and warm."
        <p></p>"…That's good."
        <p></p>Mahiru had put her arms through the sleeves of the sweatshirt, and she
        <p></p>smiled sweetly, which made Amane feel awkward. He bit his tongue to
        <p></p>keep his cheeks from melting into a smile.
        <p></p>The sweatshirt was hopelessly baggy on Mahiru.
        <p></p>Amane didn't know if it was just him or if this was true for other boys,
        <p></p>too, but he liked it when she was dressed like that, in a way that made the
        <p></p>differences in their physique really stand out. The sight made him quite
        <p></p>embarrassed.
        <p></p>It was also adorable how her fingers just poked out of the sleeves and
        <p></p>were holding on to the hem of Amane's shirt. Filled with unspeakable joy
        <p></p>and awkwardness, Amane started to get to his feet.
        <p></p>"…Um, I'm gonna go make us some hot drinks; you can stay there."
        <p></p>"Ah…"
        <p></p>But a small noise and slight resistance from Mahiru kept Amane firmly
        <p></p>planted on the floor.
        <p></p>Mahiru's hand, which had been clinging to his hem until a moment
        <p></p>earlier, now clasped Amane's hand, holding on to him as if to tell him not to
        <p></p>go.
        <p></p>Her delicate fingers were quite chilly, which confirmed to him that she
        <p></p>was colder than usual, and he saw her shiver again, in a way that didn't
        <p></p>seem to be the fault of the cold.
        <p></p>"S-sorry for stopping you."
        <p></p>"…No, it's fine… Your hands are pretty chilly, Mahiru."
        <p></p>When Amane stiffened, those delicate fingertips tried to pull away in a
        <p></p>panic, so Amane dared to wrap her hands in his own and squeeze back.
        <p></p>As soon as he did that, she looked relieved, so he surmised that she was
        <p></p>afraid to be left alone, although she didn't say as much.
        <p></p>Mahiru squeezed him back gently, as if she was depending on him, and
        <p></p>she must have been embarrassed, too, because she lowered her eyes
        <p></p>slightly. But she didn't seem ready to let Amane go.
        <p></p>"It's just that your hands are warm, Amane. You're always so warm, it
        <p></p>feels nice to have you beside me."
        <p></p>"…Oh, really?"
        <p></p>He didn't know exactly what she meant by that, and he didn't ask, but he
        <p></p>did understand that she liked him, at least.
        <p></p>In that moment, that alone was plenty for Amane.
        <p></p>Gently holding his hand, Mahiru glanced over at the clock.
        <p></p>She squinted to check the time and saw that almost two hours had
        <p></p>passed since she had come over to observe the meteors.
        <p></p>"This is the first time I've ever intentionally stayed up this late at night.
        <p></p>Normally, I'm only still awake at this time when I'm having trouble
        <p></p>sleeping. What a bad kid I'm being!"
        <p></p>"It's good to be a bad kid from time to time. I'm being bad with you,
        <p></p>too."
        <p></p>"…He-he, I wonder if it's okay for me to be bad, though."
        <p></p>"I'm sure everyone is good sometimes and bad sometimes. We're only
        <p></p>human, so we don't have to do everything perfectly all the time. It's totally
        <p></p>fine for us to be bad kids, just for tonight. You and I are the only ones here,
        <p></p>so no one's going to criticize or complain."
        <p></p>Amane smiled and said there was no issue as long as they kept it a
        <p></p>secret, which made Mahiru smile, too.
        <p></p>Her smile revealed relief and a feeling of happiness, as if she had been
        <p></p>rescued from something, and Mahiru squeezed Amane's hand again, then
        <p></p>leaned in close to him.
        <p></p>He stiffened for a moment but didn't move away and kept his cool.
        <p></p>Mahiru softly brought her face close to Amane's ear.
        <p></p>"…Can I be a little bit naughtier?"
        <p></p>"Sure. What do you want?"
        <p></p>"…I'm hungry. Let's have a midnight snack."
        <p></p>She made the suggestion in a quiet, slightly guilty-sounding voice, as if
        <p></p>she really thought that was a naughty thing to do.
        <p></p>It seemed to take courage for her to ask for such a trivial thing, which
        <p></p>she apparently thought was really bad.
        <p></p>In response to this extremely adorable request, Amane nodded with a
        <p></p>gentle smile.
        <p></p>"Absolutely. Let's be bad together."
        <p></p>Eating instant ramen with heaps of toppings in the middle of the night
        <p></p>seemed like just the right amount of naughtiness.
        <p></p>Wearing an easy smile, Amane stood up again.
        <p></p>This time he was still holding Mahiru's hand.
        <p></p>"I think we have some seasoned eggs in the fridge, and some braised
        <p></p>pork and cheese, too. Since we're doing this, let's go all out."
        <p></p>"…Seems like it'll be bad for our stomachs to eat all that in the middle
        <p></p>of the night."
        <p></p>"We're being bad, so there's no helping it," Amane replied jokingly, and
        <p></p>Mahiru put on a cheerful, excited smile.
        <p></p>Grinning at each other, the two of them headed for the kitchen.
        <p></p>Their clasped hands weren't shivering anymore.

        <p></p>Chapter 77: A Secret Decision, and Sentimentality 
        <p></p>"So are you okay with this, Yuuta?"
        <p></p>Yuuta, Itsuki, and Amane were on their way home after hanging out
        <p></p>together during Golden Week.
        <p></p>They were going different directions, so Amane's friends had walked
        <p></p>him as far as the station to see him off. Then Itsuki, who had been quiet
        <p></p>until then, asked Yuuta that question in a hushed voice.
        <p></p>"Okay with what?"
        <p></p>Yuuta knew what the inquiry meant without asking, but he purposely
        <p></p>pretended not to understand as his mouth curled upward into a smile.
        <p></p>Itsuki glanced at Yuuta with a little bit of pity, then let out one small sigh
        <p></p>and replied: "The thing about Miss Shiina, of course."
        <p></p>He sounded as if it was an obvious question and yet seemed somewhat
        <p></p>hesitant to string the words together. Yuuta also reacted as if the answer was
        <p></p>obvious.
        <p></p>Yuuta had never told Itsuki anything about it directly; in fact, he hadn't
        <p></p>even said anything to his two best friends, Kazuya and Makoto. He
        <p></p>expected Makoto had more or less figured it out, but that was all.
        <p></p>Apparently, Itsuki had seen through to the secret feelings he had been
        <p></p>trying to hide.
        <p></p>Yuuta was aware that he was the type of person who attracted a lot of
        <p></p>attention, so he had been especially careful to keep things under wraps, but
        <p></p>Itsuki seemed to know exactly what Yuuta had been hiding and was looking
        <p></p>at him with concern.
        <p></p>At times like this, it's a nuisance that he's so clever, Yuuta thought with a
        <p></p>bitter smile as he met Itsuki's probing gaze directly.
        <p></p>"I'm not sure how I'm supposed to answer that. I never meant to say
        <p></p>anything to begin with, and Fujimiya also doesn't seem inclined to tell Miss
        <p></p>Shiina anything."
        <p></p>"…You weren't holding back or anything?"
        <p></p>"No, no. I was planning to keep my feelings to myself from the start.
        <p></p>Fujimiya's got nothing to do with it, and now that we're friends, I'm even
        <p></p>less inclined to say anything. Believe me, I'm not holding back on his
        <p></p>account." Yuuta preemptively reassured his concerned friend.
        <p></p>He was trying not to give Itsuki any more funny ideas. Yuuta laughed
        <p></p>cheerfully…while hoping that it wouldn't sound hollow to Itsuki.
        <p></p>"…Anyway, I knew there was no hope right from the beginning. I would
        <p></p>never dream of getting in between the two of them, or trying to get in the
        <p></p>way. And a date…she doesn't want to date me, but if we did happen to go
        <p></p>out, I imagine I'd see there was no chance of success the moment I looked
        <p></p>at Miss Shiina's face. I wouldn't dare meddle because nothing good would
        <p></p>come of it."
        <p></p>She didn't act like it at all in school, but when he had met Mahiru
        <p></p>before, the way she had looked at Amane had unmistakably been the look
        <p></p>of a girl in love.
        <p></p>She had smiled at Amane—not with her usual fleeting, gorgeous,
        <p></p>angelic smile but with a sweet smile that held shades of emotion and
        <p></p>passion.
        <p></p>Right before his eyes, the expression on her face and the look in her eyes
        <p></p>had made it clear that she was head over heels for Amane and that there was
        <p></p>nothing anyone could do about that.
        <p></p>Seeing that was enough to convince Yuuta that there was simply no
        <p></p>hope.
        <p></p>He found it puzzling how Amane didn't seem to notice the way she
        <p></p>looked at him, but even though Yuuta hadn't known him for that long, he
        <p></p>could tell that Amane was extremely cautious—cowardly, to put it unkindly
        <p></p>—and he figured that Amane would find it difficult to believe that she liked
        <p></p>him.
        <p></p>Well, I can see how it would be difficult to believe, since he's not used to
        <p></p>being the object of affection for a perfect beauty like Miss Shiina.
        <p></p>Nevertheless, the fact that Amane still didn't have any confidence,
        <p></p>despite the way that Mahiru looked at him with such love, pointed to
        <p></p>seriously low self-esteem.
        <p></p>"Do you resent Amane?" Itsuki asked.
        <p></p>"Are you worried I would?"
        <p></p>"I don't think so, based on your personality, but just in case…or more
        <p></p>like, just to be sure? I wanna check that you're really okay with it. I'm
        <p></p>Amane's friend, but I'm your friend, too, Yuuta. I guess I don't want either
        <p></p>of you to end up unhappy."
        <p></p>When it came to the relationship between Amane and Mahiru, Itsuki
        <p></p>was decisively in favor of their romance. Yuuta knew that, so he was
        <p></p>surprised to hear Itsuki's words, and he blinked dramatically several times
        <p></p>in spite of himself.
        <p></p>Apparently, Itsuki was concerned about him, too. As he felt the depths
        <p></p>of his chest gradually growing warmer, Yuuta shrugged.
        <p></p>"You don't have to worry; I don't want to cause trouble, and I'm not
        <p></p>going to intrude. I know you're not too dull to understand that."
        <p></p>Even if he hadn't been friends with Amane, he wasn't the sort of
        <p></p>reckless person who, having seen how the two of them acted, would still try
        <p></p>to butt in.
        <p></p>It was precisely because Itsuki was in the difficult position of being
        <p></p>close friends with both Yuuta and Amane that he was reading too much into
        <p></p>things, Yuuta thought. He felt a little bad for him.
        <p></p>Yuuta smiled once more as Itsuki gave him an anxious-looking gaze.
        <p></p>"I'm not as hurt as you think, Itsuki. How can I put this? My feelings
        <p></p>toward Miss Shiina were…more like admiration, I guess. Nothing serious."
        <p></p>It was true that he liked Mahiru, but if anyone asked him if his passion
        <p></p>was strong enough to make him burn with love, he would have said no.
        <p></p>A love that he could keep from showing on his face, that he could bury
        <p></p>away in the depths of his heart, that he could keep away from the surface,
        <p></p>was a shallow, benign thing.
        <p></p>"It's not exactly that I'm withdrawing out of concern for Fujimiya, it's
        <p></p>more…I probably…if you asked me whether I was serious about her, the
        <p></p>answer is probably no. It's not really love that I feel for her, more like
        <p></p>empathy and adoration."
        <p></p>"Empathy?"
        <p></p>It must have been an unexpected word, because Itsuki blinked in
        <p></p>surprise. Yuuta shot him a wry smile.
        <p></p>"Well, I always thought of Miss Shiina as being cut from the same cloth
        <p></p>as I am. The type of person who's fed up with the opposite sex. Happy to be
        <p></p>admired but, on the other hand, suffering under the weight of inertia. It's too
        <p></p>late to change the face she wears in front of other people, so she suffocates
        <p></p>under the smiling mask, that type… Miss Shiina is the same as me, but she
        <p></p>handles it better than I do. I admired the way she could conceal everything
        <p></p>and smile as if she wasn't in any pain."
        <p></p>Yuuta knew that, objectively speaking, he was considered better looking
        <p></p>than most people and that he had many talents worth boasting about. He
        <p></p>also understood that this made him very attractive to many of the opposite
        <p></p>sex.
        <p></p>But all that attention was focused on his appearance and abilities, and he
        <p></p>was fully aware that he was looked upon as a kind of idol.
        <p></p>For that very reason, he couldn't feel any affection toward the girls who
        <p></p>desired him as an object. Their interest seemed shallow.
        <p></p>So when he first saw Mahiru, who was in the same position he was in,
        <p></p>she'd piqued his interest. And he was impressed by how she acted as if she
        <p></p>didn't struggle with hardship at all.
        <p></p>He had admired her, standing bravely on her own.
        <p></p>But ultimately, seeing her like that was still a way of forcing an image
        <p></p>onto her. Yuuta was projecting the very feelings he couldn't stand onto
        <p></p>Mahiru.
        <p></p>But with Amane, the sublime Mahiru smiled like an ordinary girl. She
        <p></p>wasn't the perfect beauty, the angel who never let anyone near her, but just
        <p></p>an everyday girl in love.
        <p></p>And Amane treated her like a normal person.
        <p></p>Now that Mahiru had found a partner who treasured her for who she
        <p></p>really was, Yuuta couldn't even look straight at her anymore.
        <p></p>"In my personal view, when I saw them together, that was when I
        <p></p>understood that the flower on a high peak blooming in dignified solitude,
        <p></p>that Miss Shiina, was…it sounds bad to say it this way, but she's just an
        <p></p>ordinary girl. I saw that she had found someone who really loved her and
        <p></p>that she only had eyes for him, which made me want to cheer them on more
        <p></p>than cut in. I want her to find happiness."
        <p></p>If Mahiru had finally found someone who really understood her, there
        <p></p>was no way that Yuuta, who was in a sense in the same position as she was
        <p></p>in, could stand against them.
        <p></p>"You waste your good looks by being so nice, you know?"
        <p></p>"What have my looks got to do with this? Or are you just complimenting
        <p></p>me?"
        <p></p>"It's a compliment, really. Just a compliment."
        <p></p>"I wonder…"
        <p></p>Itsuki cracked a teasing smile, and Yuuta smiled weakly back.
        <p></p>"Well, whatever, it's fine… And anyway, let me make it clear that I
        <p></p>don't hold a grudge against Fujimiya or anything. He's a good guy; it's too
        <p></p>bad not everyone knows that."
        <p></p>Amane was the kind of person who didn't really stand out in class, but
        <p></p>Yuuta saw him for the gentle, kind, and sensible person that he was.
        <p></p>Amane was often short with Itsuki, but that was just superficial—one of
        <p></p>their ways of joking around. In reality, he was a compassionate person, a
        <p></p>sensitive guy who paid attention to others and considered their needs.
        <p></p>His obvious weak point was that he didn't have much confidence in
        <p></p>himself, but his great merit was that although he seemed cold, he actually
        <p></p>had a warm demeanor and was incredibly considerate of others.
        <p></p>If the angel, who only ever wore a beautiful smile in school and
        <p></p>absolutely never let anyone see her true feelings, placed that much trust in
        <p></p>him, then the quality of his character was guaranteed.
        <p></p>Amane also loved Mahiru, and he showed her affection without going
        <p></p>overboard. It was abundantly clear that he saw Mahiru for who she really
        <p></p>was. And the look in his eyes when he stared at her showed that he
        <p></p>cherished and loved her.
        <p></p>Surely, Yuuta couldn't possibly come between two people who were so
        <p></p>in love with each other.
        <p></p>"The two of them can't not be together."
        <p></p>Yuuta didn't usually believe in so-called fate, but when he thought about
        <p></p>the two of them and how perfectly they went together, he really believed
        <p></p>that they were somehow supposed to be together.
        <p></p>That was how close they were and how well they complemented each
        <p></p>other.
        <p></p>"This is probably a bad way of putting this, but I think I'll probably be
        <p></p>fine without Miss Shiina. It's not like I absolutely can't live without her.
        <p></p>Knowing that, it would be rude for me to go snatch her away, and she
        <p></p>probably wouldn't even be interested."
        <p></p>"…Really?"
        <p></p>"So instead of loss, or jealousy…I'm feeling more impatient than
        <p></p>anything else. I want her to hurry up and be happy."
        <p></p>He did feel a little lonesome, but his loneliness was overshadowed by
        <p></p>his desire for the two of them to find happiness together.
        <p></p>He wanted them to be united, and he wanted them to support each other.
        <p></p>He saw in them the makings of a happily married couple, and he couldn't
        <p></p>bring himself to be jealous.
        <p></p>When Yuuta asserted that he was genuinely cheering them on, Itsuki
        <p></p>smiled at him with an expression that was both awkward and bittersweet.
        <p></p>"You're a good egg, Yuuta."
        <p></p>"Are you making fun of me?"
        <p></p>"I'm not, I'm not. I was just thinking that I'm blessed with a really good
        <p></p>circle of friends."
        <p></p>Itsuki smiled poignantly as he ran a hand through his hair, and Yuuta
        <p></p>smiled back at him.
        <p></p>The one who was truly blessed by his circle of friends was Yuuta.
        <p></p>Itsuki always paid careful attention like this so that things around him
        <p></p>wouldn't go awry, and he was always worrying about his friends. But he
        <p></p>never demanded any gratitude, and he didn't want to risk hurting anyone, so
        <p></p>he never took sides and tried to support everyone.
        <p></p>It made Yuuta think again that he had found himself some valuable
        <p></p>friends.
        <p></p>While he was counting his blessings, Yuuta smiled calmly and ignored
        <p></p>the warmth that was building behind his eyes and threatening to spill down
        <p></p>his chilly cheeks

        <p></p>Chapter 78: How We Spend Time Together 
        <p></p>"Amane, what have you been doing with Miss Shiina when you're alone
        <p></p>together?"
        <p></p>On the way home from school, Amane stopped by a bookstore to buy a
        <p></p>study book, and Itsuki, who never seemed to have any interest in such
        <p></p>things, suddenly asked him that question in a quiet voice.
        <p></p>It really was sudden, so Amane shot his friend a puzzled look, but he
        <p></p>saw that Itsuki was holding a magazine in his hands with a headline written
        <p></p>in big letters, "Recommended Ways to Spend Time Together on a Home
        <p></p>Date!" so that explained some things.
        <p></p>He's asked me something similar before. What is he thinking, when
        <p></p>we're not even dating?
        <p></p>Amane was annoyed, but he didn't have the slightest thing to feel guilty
        <p></p>about, so he decided it would seem more suspicious to avoid the question.
        <p></p>With that thought, Amane looked up a little, still holding the study book
        <p></p>he needed in his hand, and recalled how he and Mahiru had been spending
        <p></p>their time together.
        <p></p>They certainly didn't spend their time the way Itsuki was probably
        <p></p>thinking.
        <p></p>It should have been obvious, but Amane and Mahiru were just close
        <p></p>friends at the moment. They regularly ate meals together, but that was it.
        <p></p>There was absolutely no romantic involvement.
        <p></p>So there were none of the salacious details that Itsuki seemed to be
        <p></p>expecting, no lovers' embraces to speak of, like boyfriend and girlfriend
        <p></p>might do. All he could say was that they usually spent their time together.
        <p></p>"…Even when we're in the same room, sometimes we're doing different
        <p></p>stuff, or sometimes we do homework or something. At most, we watch TV
        <p></p>or read together… That's about it."
        <p></p>Both Amane and Mahiru were diligent students—Amane perhaps less so
        <p></p>than Mahiru. After they enjoyed whatever Mahiru made for dinner, the two
        <p></p>of them usually cleaned up and then completed their homework
        <p></p>assignments, reviewed and prepared their study materials, and got ready for
        <p></p>the next day's classes. If they had extra time, they relaxed and watched
        <p></p>television, or flipped through a comic book or magazine together, or
        <p></p>occasionally played a video game. That was about the state of things.
        <p></p>They also frequently sat beside each other doing their own things, as
        <p></p>Amane had described.
        <p></p>Mahiru had her lacework and embroidery, which served as a diversion
        <p></p>and hobby, and Amane spent his time playing social media games and
        <p></p>watching video clips on the internet.
        <p></p>They weren't necessarily always doing something together, and when
        <p></p>they were each engaged doing something they liked, neither of them ever
        <p></p>really bothered the other.
        <p></p>Amane explained this simply, and Itsuki opened his eyes unnaturally
        <p></p>wide, as if he had seen something he couldn't believe, and said in a
        <p></p>trembling voice, "Why aren't you making any progress, when you've got
        <p></p>the girl you love all to yourself?!"
        <p></p>"Shut up. First of all, I do love her, which is why I'm not forcing
        <p></p>anything along."
        <p></p>"Coward!"
        <p></p>"Be quiet! Anyway, if I did anything, I would only be inviting danger."
        <p></p>It was unthinkable, but just supposing that Amane were to act like an
        <p></p>animal and pounce on Mahiru, she probably wouldn't hesitate to attack him
        <p></p>in the most tender of targets.
        <p></p>He could be sure of that, since she had already told him she would fight
        <p></p>back if provoked.
        <p></p>He absolutely believed that he would be crushed, without a doubt.
        <p></p>"Miss Shiina would do that?"
        <p></p>"She told me she would, right from the start."
        <p></p>"Huh…"
        <p></p>Itsuki seemed to think that Mahiru was polite and quiet and wouldn't
        <p></p>ever do anything violent. But while Amane would agree that she was polite
        <p></p>and quiet, she was also a levelheaded person who was alert to the danger
        <p></p>around her and would not hesitate to deal with any threats.
        <p></p>Of course, it was only natural that she had the right to protect herself,
        <p></p>but Itsuki seemed skeptical.
        <p></p>"Would she really go that far?"
        <p></p>"Well, I don't want to hurt Mahiru in the first place, and I hate the idea
        <p></p>of forcing her to do something she doesn't want and having her despise me.
        <p></p>Why should I make her cry, when I want to cherish her? I don't want to
        <p></p>become the kind of awful guy who just takes what he wants, no matter
        <p></p>what."
        <p></p>Amane would be much worse off if he tried to force his desires on her
        <p></p>and she ended up in tears, hating him for it.
        <p></p>Amane wanted to treat Mahiru with kindness and sincerity, so he
        <p></p>couldn't selfishly force his feelings on her. That applied with Mahiru, of
        <p></p>course, but also with any other person as well.
        <p></p>"That's a good quality of yours, but you're still a coward, man."
        <p></p>"Oh, shut up… Seriously, it's fine. I'm having a perfectly good time just
        <p></p>spending the day together."
        <p></p>He wasn't in a rush to move their relationship to the next level or do
        <p></p>whatever Itsuki was thinking about.
        <p></p>Of course, he did want Mahiru to like him back, but he wanted her to
        <p></p>take her time and fall for him after she got to know him better. Particularly
        <p></p>with Mahiru, he wasn't just interested in her superficial qualities, so he also
        <p></p>wanted her to really get to know him, even if it took time.
        <p></p>After all, he figured she already knew about the sloppy and irresponsible
        <p></p>parts of him. So if she still wanted to take the time to get to know him, he
        <p></p>wasn't going to deny her the chance.
        <p></p>Itsuki looked pretty astonished by Amane's words, but Amane had no
        <p></p>intention of changing his opinion, so he ignored the look Itsuki was giving
        <p></p>him and carried his study book up to the register.
        <p></p>When Amane got home, he helped Mahiru make dinner as he always did.
        <p></p>They ate together, and then it was time to relax and study.
        <p></p>Really, nothing much was different, as Mahiru sat quietly beside Amane,
        <p></p>devoting herself to her studies. She was apparently already finished with
        <p></p>her homework, so she was going over the material for their upcoming
        <p></p>lessons.
        <p></p>It wasn't an especially romantic situation, the way Itsuki seemed to
        <p></p>imagine, and Amane also had his own studies to work on. He was quietly
        <p></p>engrossed in the reference book he had purchased earlier that day.
        <p></p>The only sounds were the scratching of their mechanical pencils across
        <p></p>paper, the turning of pages, and their breathing, resonating in the silence.
        <p></p>The television was off so they could concentrate, and night had fallen, so
        <p></p>the room was a really peaceful space.
        <p></p>Amane had been silently working through the problems in his study
        <p></p>book for a while. Feeling his concentration start to waver, he raised his head
        <p></p>to take a breather.
        <p></p>As he moved his shoulders gently up and down to loosen his muscles, he
        <p></p>happened to glance beside him, where Mahiru was still working away at her
        <p></p>study book. Her ramrod-straight posture was lovely and composed—anyone
        <p></p>would have thought as much.
        <p></p>Her expression was serious as she wordlessly moved her pencil.
        <p></p>There was an almost dreamlike, bewitching quality to her slightly
        <p></p>downturned eyes, and without meaning to, Amane let the pencil he was
        <p></p>holding slip from his hand as he stared at Mahiru, utterly absorbed.
        <p></p>"…Is something the matter?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had apparently noticed his gaze, and she twisted her body so that
        <p></p>she was facing him. A gentle, slightly discouraged smile drifted across her
        <p></p>lips. Amane suddenly felt embarrassed that he had been so captivated by
        <p></p>her.
        <p></p>"Ah, n-no, it's nothing."
        <p></p>"…Really?"
        <p></p>"N-no, I just, well, I was thinking, your posture is so nice."
        <p></p>He wasn't lying, so he figured that was all right. He had indeed been
        <p></p>impressed by her posture, after all.
        <p></p>Mahiru blinked several times at the mention of her posture.
        <p></p>"Is that so? This is how I normally sit."
        <p></p>"And I think it's amazing that that is your 'normal.' Your back is
        <p></p>absolutely straight when we're eating meals, too, which is proof that you
        <p></p>always maintain good posture."
        <p></p>"He-he, well, Miss Koyuki was very strict about that. She always said
        <p></p>that lovely posture and bearing gives other people a favorable impression of
        <p></p>you and that if your posture is good, you end up looking straight ahead, and
        <p></p>that's naturally connected to having self-confidence."
        <p></p>The idea was persuasive when Mahiru said it with an elegant smile.
        <p></p>Graceful manners were naturally more likable than coarse manners, and
        <p></p>people with good posture did seem to have more confidence. Those who
        <p></p>seemed confident were probably treated as such and gained more
        <p></p>confidence, too.
        <p></p>"You're usually a little hunched over, Amane, so you ought to think
        <p></p>about improving your posture and training your back muscles. Here, sit
        <p></p>up!"
        <p></p>With a sweet-sounding command, Mahiru reached over to straighten
        <p></p>Amane's somewhat curved back. She gently grabbed one of Amane's
        <p></p>shoulders, placed her other hand on his back, and corrected his posture.
        <p></p>"Having nice posture is proof that you've trained your body. If your
        <p></p>back muscles are weak, your torso will shift around, and you'll have a
        <p></p>tendency to hunch. You've been working hard at your training recently, so I
        <p></p>may be sticking my nose where it doesn't belong, but as important as
        <p></p>exercising your legs is, you should also properly train up the muscles on
        <p></p>your back. Consciously improving your posture is also a form of training,
        <p></p>you know."
        <p></p>Amane felt a strange chill as Mahiru slowly rubbed his back, which was
        <p></p>now straight, while whispering those words close to his ear. "S-sure," he
        <p></p>yelped in a shrill voice.
        <p></p>Mahiru let out a soft, easygoing laugh, like the tinkling of a bell.
        <p></p>"You don't have to be so stiff. You can fix your posture just by paying a
        <p></p>little bit of attention, okay?"
        <p></p>Amane was slightly relieved to realize that Mahiru had apparently
        <p></p>concluded it was the unfamiliar position that was bothering him.
        <p></p>Beside him, satisfied that he would keep his back straight this time,
        <p></p>Mahiru moved away a little…and then stared directly at Amane.
        <p></p>"…What?"
        <p></p>"Payback for earlier."
        <p></p>"I see."
        <p></p>Apparently, Mahiru was going to stare at Amane this time, which made
        <p></p>it extremely difficult for Amane to do anything.
        <p></p>Maintaining her lovely posture and smiling happily as she looked at
        <p></p>him, Mahiru gave off a kind of impish impression.
        <p></p>"…I can't imagine it's all that much fun looking at me."
        <p></p>"You're wrong about that. It is fun."
        <p></p>"What's fun about it?"
        <p></p>"Let me see; it's fun for me to make observations, like how your
        <p></p>eyelashes are surprisingly long, and that your bangs have grown out a little
        <p></p>and look like they might be in your way, and that your Adam's apple is
        <p></p>quite visible."
        <p></p>His embarrassment grew as she listed these unexpected details.
        <p></p>There was no way he wouldn't be embarrassed, having parts of him he
        <p></p>was hardly even aware of described like that.
        <p></p>He didn't exactly hate it, but being checked over in detail by the girl he
        <p></p>liked suddenly made him feel like running away.
        <p></p>"Don't look at me so closely, please."
        <p></p>"No way, you're adorable."
        <p></p>Amane wondered what exactly she was looking at that made her say
        <p></p>something like that, but before he could complain, he heard Mahiru's
        <p></p>tinkling laugh again.
        <p></p>"You've got plenty of charms, Amane, even in places you yourself don't
        <p></p>realize. I thought I would take a good look at some of them."
        <p></p>Mahiru put her hand to her mouth and laughed elegantly.
        <p></p>Unable to stand it, Amane grumbled, "Do as you please," and turned
        <p></p>back to his reference book.
        <p></p>Perhaps it was inevitable, but under Mahiru's scrutiny, his posture
        <p></p>quickly broke down, and he collapsed onto the table. Her amused laughter
        <p></p>increased even more.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 79: An Early Afternoon Nap, and Mahiru’s Curiosity 
        <p></p>One weekend, in the early afternoon, Amane was stretched out on the sofa
        <p></p>enjoying a nap.
        <p></p>Though summer was growing closer day by day, the temperature was
        <p></p>still comfortable without turning on the air conditioner. It was just the right
        <p></p>season for taking afternoon naps.
        <p></p>About an hour after he lay down on his favorite sofa, he sensed a
        <p></p>presence beside him and woke up.
        <p></p>"…Good grief, no matter how warm it might be, you'll catch a cold with
        <p></p>your stomach exposed."
        <p></p>He heard a somewhat exasperated voice, and when he cracked his eyes
        <p></p>open, he saw it was Mahiru who had spoken in a chiding tone. She was
        <p></p>standing there with her back to him.
        <p></p>Then she took a blanket from the basket that was on the shelf.
        <p></p>When he glanced down at his own midsection, he saw that it was bare,
        <p></p>probably because his shirt had ridden up when he had turned over in his
        <p></p>sleep.
        <p></p>Thanks to Mahiru managing his diet and a moderate amount of jogging
        <p></p>and weight lifting, he didn't have any excess fat, but he also didn't have
        <p></p>very distinct stomach muscles like Yuuta did; his stomach was just slim
        <p></p>enough that the muscles were faintly visible. He felt something akin to
        <p></p>embarrassment at being so exposed in front of Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Really, what a hopeless guy you are…," she mumbled quietly. Her
        <p></p>words had a sort of tender, loving ring to them, which made Amane's heart
        <p></p>thump.
        <p></p>Mahiru turned around with the blanket in her hand and approached him.
        <p></p>He was curious to see what she would do if he kept on pretending to be
        <p></p>asleep, and he watched her through narrowed eyes, just barely open, so that
        <p></p>she wouldn't notice.
        <p></p>For some reason, Mahiru stopped and stared fixedly at his midsection,
        <p></p>still holding the blanket.
        <p></p>He braced himself for her to say that his stomach looked flabby, but then
        <p></p>Mahiru cast her eyes downward. She looked slightly embarrassed.
        <p></p>She glanced back up at him, then her gaze settled on his stomach again.
        <p></p>Her cheeks were faintly flushed, and she seemed to be wavering
        <p></p>indecisively over something.
        <p></p>"…Come to think of it, he did say he had been lifting weights.
        <p></p>Compared to before…"
        <p></p>When she quietly muttered those words, Amane thought to himself, You
        <p></p>know, I guess I do have a better figure than I did when she nursed me back
        <p></p>from that cold.
        <p></p>Back then, he had been living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle, so he
        <p></p>had looked more like a string bean than a manly man. Now he was more
        <p></p>disciplined, however slightly, so he probably looked a lot sturdier than he
        <p></p>had back then.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to remember that time, too, and her face suddenly turned
        <p></p>quite red, but she still didn't take her eyes off his stomach.
        <p></p>She didn't seem to have noticed that Amane wasn't sleeping, and she
        <p></p>looked restless.
        <p></p>Amane was awake, but he couldn't show it. He was sure that she would
        <p></p>run away if he got up now, so all he could do was watch her. With a
        <p></p>determined expression, Mahiru came over and softly touched his stomach,
        <p></p>which almost made him flinch.
        <p></p>She seemed curious as her small hand explored his exposed abdomen.
        <p></p>Every time her soft fingertips ran up and down one of his meager
        <p></p>abdominal muscles, a sensation ran slowly up his spine, which he knew he
        <p></p>mustn't let show on his face.
        <p></p>…Th-this isn't good.
        <p></p>Normally, he didn't think anything of her facing him straight on and
        <p></p>touching him without hesitation, but it was a completely different story
        <p></p>when she looked so timid and shy and hesitantly traced her fingers over him
        <p></p>with the slightest pressure.
        <p></p>The way she was touching him was almost frustrating; plus, he was
        <p></p>ticklish, and it seemed likely to stir up feelings and urges he didn't want at
        <p></p>the moment.
        <p></p>If she was going to do that, it would have saved Amane some grief if she
        <p></p>had applied a little more pressure, since that wouldn't have been such a
        <p></p>perplexing sensation. But Mahiru carefully touched him with discretion and
        <p></p>caution, intending not to wake Amane from his pretend sleep.
        <p></p>That made it all the more tantalizing.
        <p></p>Honestly, he was delighted to have the girl he liked there touching his
        <p></p>body, but the location and timing were all wrong. If she kept going, things
        <p></p>would get really out of hand.
        <p></p>So when he grabbed her wrist to stop her from touching him anymore,
        <p></p>Mahiru visibly shuddered.
        <p></p>"…As you can imagine, touching me like that puts me in an awkward
        <p></p>position."
        <p></p>Her hand was below his abs, approaching his lower abdomen, so that
        <p></p>was really not good. When he restrained her from going any farther, Mahiru
        <p></p>froze all over.
        <p></p>Only her mouth and eyes moved. Her eyes went wide in disbelief, and
        <p></p>her mouth opened and closed silently.
        <p></p>Mahiru herself probably wasn't the least bit aware of the danger, but
        <p></p>Amane was all too aware and had no option but to stop her.
        <p></p>"It's okay for you to touch me when I'm awake, but…Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Y-you were f-faking?"
        <p></p>"Sorry, I was curious to see what you would do."
        <p></p>Amane's words caused Mahiru's cheeks to instantly ignite. Then she
        <p></p>yanked her hand out of his and put the blanket over her head.
        <p></p>"…I-I'm sorry. I just, y-your body looked stronger than I remembered,
        <p></p>and—"
        <p></p>"If you were curious, you could have just said so, and I would have let
        <p></p>you touch me. But…how can I say this…if you touch me too much like you
        <p></p>just were… Well, I'm a guy, so it's not a good idea… I might have a
        <p></p>reaction that you wouldn't like, so I want you to be careful."
        <p></p>He had narrowly avoided disaster this time, but if she had carried on
        <p></p>touching him for just a little while longer, things would have gotten very
        <p></p>out of hand.
        <p></p>"I'm grateful that you were kind enough to think of putting a blanket
        <p></p>over me. But next time, I'd rather you just put it on and be done with it."
        <p></p>"I-I'm sorry…"
        <p></p>"…Well, did you enjoy yourself?"
        <p></p>Mahiru was too cute, slumped on the floor with a bright-red face,
        <p></p>trembling, and Amane asked in spite of his better judgment.
        <p></p>The moment he did, Mahiru rocked back, then battered his stomach with
        <p></p>both fists, looking as though she might cry.
        <p></p>"…I was in the wrong, but now you're just being mean, Amane," she
        <p></p>grumbled.
        <p></p>She stood up and fled the room, taking the blanket with her, and Amane
        <p></p>pressed his lips together and closed his eyes, trying to settle his body, which
        <p></p>was still feeling somewhat restless.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 80: Watching Over Your Friends’ Romance Is Also Difficult 
        <p></p>Chitose, who prided herself on being Mahiru's best friend, was extremely
        <p></p>impatient about the fact that her best friend's romance was taking so long to
        <p></p>bloom.
        <p></p>That was likely because both parties involved were trying to avoid
        <p></p>overstepping. This was unavoidable, since both Mahiru and Amane were
        <p></p>cautious by nature, but since they were clearly in love with each other, it
        <p></p>was irritating to watch from the sidelines and see them going nowhere.
        <p></p>"…This one, or this one; I wonder which he would like better?"
        <p></p>Mahiru debated, holding two sets of clothes up to her body in an apparel
        <p></p>shop, while Chitose gave her a half-hearted smile.
        <p></p>They had gone out shopping for new summer clothes that day, and after
        <p></p>picking up a few items that caught her eye, Mahiru had started hemming
        <p></p>and hawing over them.
        <p></p>From Chitose's perspective, either one would suit Mahiru, who looked
        <p></p>stylish in most clothes, and she could practically see Mahiru getting a lot of
        <p></p>compliments if she walked around town in either outfit.
        <p></p>And yet, she was hesitating, probably because she was considering how
        <p></p>the person she liked would see her.
        <p></p>"If you're worried about Amane, I think he'd say either one is cute, you
        <p></p>know."
        <p></p>Amane was extremely thoughtful when it came to Mahiru. He was the
        <p></p>kind of guy who could be smooth about complimenting a girl's appearance.
        <p></p>He had even complimented Chitose once or twice, always giving his honest
        <p></p>impressions. It seemed that when it came to Mahiru, he would think either
        <p></p>outfit was cute, no matter which one she chose.
        <p></p>At Chitose's words, Mahiru made a strained expression and looked back
        <p></p>and forth at the clothes she was holding.
        <p></p>"You're probably right, but since I'm making the effort, well, I'd like to
        <p></p>get one that he'll like. I think that if I put on something he likes, I'll look
        <p></p>more desirable… I want him to think I look even cuter than usual. But it's
        <p></p>not like I want to buy something just for Amane; this is for my own selfsatisfaction."
        <p></p>The two outfits were reflected in Mahiru's eyes, but she seemed to be
        <p></p>looking not at the clothes but through the clothes to Amane.
        <p></p>"…Amane always compliments me and says I look cute when I dress
        <p></p>up, but…well, he doesn't really tell me what he likes. He says it's best for
        <p></p>me to wear what I like. That may be true, but still, I would be happy if he
        <p></p>liked the same things I do, and it would make me happy if he really thought
        <p></p>I looked cute. So I thought I'd dress up in something Amane would like, for
        <p></p>me."
        <p></p>She smiled, a lovely, joyful, sweet smile. Her flawless smile was so
        <p></p>beautiful that even Chitose, who was also a girl, was stunned and
        <p></p>enchanted.
        <p></p>Her smile was so extremely pretty that even the shop clerk was gaping at
        <p></p>Mahiru, so a flustered Chitose tried to put an end to it, but Mahiru didn't
        <p></p>seem to notice Chitose's frustration and kept on smiling bashfully.
        <p></p>"Of course, I don't mean all the time! But, like, on days when we go out
        <p></p>together, I want to make him think I look cuter than usual, you know?"
        <p></p>Mahiru looked embarrassed but puffed up her chest slightly and looked
        <p></p>up at the ceiling as if she was recalling Amane, who was not there. She
        <p></p>looked cuter and more charming than any other girl Chitose knew.
        <p></p>"…Trying so hard to get him to think that I look cute and compliment
        <p></p>me sounds awfully shameful, doesn't it?"
        <p></p>"I think that any guy out there who would judge you for that would get a
        <p></p>beating from the majority of girls."
        <p></p>Chitose wouldn't tolerate any complaint leveled at a girl searching for
        <p></p>clothes that her beloved would like in such a charming, adorable manner.
        <p></p>Amane was the type who would recognize, respect, and value the effort
        <p></p>the girl made, so that gave Chitose peace of mind. But she was also in
        <p></p>disbelief that Amane didn't realize the extent to which Mahiru cared for
        <p></p>him.
        <p></p>I know that I can't say anything, but this, this is…!
        <p></p>If Amane saw Mahiru fretting over choosing an outfit like this, with a
        <p></p>lovelorn expression on her face, he would instantly understand how she felt.
        <p></p>But Mahiru didn't want to show him these secret efforts of hers.
        <p></p>Amane only got to see the end result of Mahiru's efforts to devise the
        <p></p>perfect outfit.
        <p></p>…But getting to see dear Mahiru putting in the effort like this is my
        <p></p>special privilege, I guess.
        <p></p>Chitose knew a side of Mahiru that Amane had never seen. The thought
        <p></p>inspired a sort of tickle of happiness and a slight sense of superiority.
        <p></p>"…Okay, I've decided on this one."
        <p></p>Apparently, while Chitose had been inwardly boasting that the absent
        <p></p>Amane must be jealous of her, Mahiru had decided which outfit to buy. She
        <p></p>carefully returned the clothing she wasn't purchasing to the rack and carried
        <p></p>the dress she had chosen to the register.
        <p></p>Watching Mahiru go, Chitose muttered quietly to herself, "Amane's
        <p></p>pretty lucky, too, huh?"
        <p></p>Another day, on her way over to Mahiru's place, Chitose spotted a familiar
        <p></p>black-haired young man standing in the park with his hands on his knees.
        <p></p>His shoulders were heaving up and down, and he was trying to catch his
        <p></p>breath. He was dressed in sportswear and looked like he had just been
        <p></p>jogging.
        <p></p>Thinking about it, Chitose did recall hearing a while back that he was
        <p></p>going to start training his body and that he had asked Yuuta for advice.
        <p></p>Yuuta and Chitose were sort of old childhood friends. Chitose could not
        <p></p>help but find Amane's efforts charming.
        <p></p>"Wow, funny seeing you here!" She had spotted him as she happened to
        <p></p>pass by, so she called out to Amane and waved as she approached him with
        <p></p>a smile.
        <p></p>"Gah, Chitose!" came the extremely rude response from Amane. He
        <p></p>seemed to be in the middle of exercising.
        <p></p>"Why would you react like you just ran into someone awful?"
        <p></p>"Whenever you show up, I'm worried that you're just here to make fun
        <p></p>of me. Actually, why are you here? Your house isn't even nearby."
        <p></p>"I'm here because I was invited by sweet Mahiru."
        <p></p>As a general rule, whenever she and Mahiru hung out at someone's
        <p></p>home, they were usually at Mahiru's.
        <p></p>Mahiru's apartment was bigger than Chitose's room, and at Chitose's
        <p></p>house, if it was a weekend or a school break, her older brothers were there,
        <p></p>and they were annoying, always coming up with some kind of plan to
        <p></p>bother the girls. Because of that, Mahiru's place was ideal.
        <p></p>Chitose's older brothers were college students, so they led quite carefree
        <p></p>lifestyles. But neither of them showed any signs of having a girlfriend yet,
        <p></p>so their little sister's beautiful friend must have looked very appealing.
        <p></p>But from the little sister's perspective, it made her want to shout at them
        <p></p>that her friend was already spoken for and not to go anywhere near her, and
        <p></p>she'd had to literally kick them out more than once.
        <p></p>Chitose, who had been secretly protecting Mahiru from her brothers'
        <p></p>clutches, grinned at Amane, who naturally knew nothing about any of that.
        <p></p>"Jealous?" She smiled, trying to rile him up a little.
        <p></p>Amane frowned slightly, perhaps somewhat offended by Chitose's tone
        <p></p>of voice, but he didn't twist his face into any further expressions.
        <p></p>"I see. Well, go on, then, don't make her wait."
        <p></p>"Oh, that's not nice. I made sure to get here earlier than promised!"
        <p></p>She was sometimes late getting to school but tried her best not to be late
        <p></p>when she was going to hang out with friends, and she had never been late to
        <p></p>Mahiru's.
        <p></p>She had gotten there that day with enough time to spare to stand around
        <p></p>talking to Amane, and she wasn't going to be late just because of a brief
        <p></p>conversation.
        <p></p>When she confidently asserted that she was keeping a close eye on the
        <p></p>time, Amane looked a little fed up. He unnecessarily remarked, "And yet
        <p></p>you just barely make it to school."
        <p></p>Chitose ignored his comment for the moment.
        <p></p>"Anyway, enough about me. Were you exercising, Amane?"
        <p></p>"Yeah. I do it every day."
        <p></p>"Every day? Good for you. That's a big change from before."
        <p></p>"Shaddup."
        <p></p>Amane had never seemed to like exercise much, but he had changed
        <p></p>since that spring. Chitose was just guessing, but the change had probably
        <p></p>taken place after he admitted that he liked Mahiru.
        <p></p>Frankly, before then, Amane hadn't exactly been melancholy, but he had
        <p></p>seemed like a cheerless and quiet person who didn't want to have much to
        <p></p>do with other people, the type of person who, until Itsuki introduced them,
        <p></p>Chitose would never have considered trying to befriend.
        <p></p>That all changed the moment Amane started liking someone.
        <p></p>As someone who had been watching close at hand as this guy, who had
        <p></p>had a tendency to hang his head, rapidly became more forward-facing,
        <p></p>Chitose was impressed by the magnificent power of love.
        <p></p>I guess people really can change.
        <p></p>Looking at Amane, who was trying to change himself with a positive
        <p></p>attitude, she saw a big difference between him and the way she used to be.
        <p></p>In my case, if I had to say, I changed in a positive way, but for negative
        <p></p>reasons.
        <p></p>Though Chitose felt somewhat sour recalling her middle school days,
        <p></p>she didn't say a word about it and instead smiled at Amane, who had turned
        <p></p>away to hide his embarrassment.
        <p></p>"Guys and girls both change when they fall in love, huh?"
        <p></p>"Are you by any chance smiling because you're making fun of me?"
        <p></p>"No way, I'm not that twisted! I'm impressed that the ever-indifferent
        <p></p>Amane has started remodeling his body."
        <p></p>"…Is that so bad?"
        <p></p>"Uh-uh, no, but, like, I guess you're the type who can put in the work, if
        <p></p>it's for Mahiru's sake. The power of love, and all that."
        <p></p>Amane suddenly froze. She waited to see if she had indeed said too
        <p></p>much, and just when she thought his embarrassment had shifted to anger, he
        <p></p>shook his head with a calm look in his eyes.
        <p></p>"…It's not exactly for Mahiru's sake. I just can't stand it when I'm there
        <p></p>beside her and someone points out that I'm not a good match for her,
        <p></p>because it makes her feel bad. I just want to get to a place where I can be
        <p></p>proud of myself."
        <p></p>Chitose didn't feel like forcing him to admit that he was doing it for
        <p></p>Mahiru. Amane was so straightforward when he spoke that Chitose felt
        <p></p>somewhat relieved and laughed in spite of herself.
        <p></p>Wowza, they sure are two of a kind.
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru would probably be judged to be complete opposites
        <p></p>by someone who didn't know the two of them, but Chitose, who knew them
        <p></p>both well, could see that they were two peas in a pod.
        <p></p>They were both hard workers who improved themselves for their own
        <p></p>sake and not for anyone else and who never pushed responsibility off onto
        <p></p>other people. Amane's desire to stand proudly beside Mahiru seemed like a
        <p></p>worthy one.
        <p></p>From Chitose's point of view, she thought it was a wonderful thing that
        <p></p>Amane had such determination, but on the other hand, she worried that it
        <p></p>might become a bit of an encumbrance…but since he was voluntarily
        <p></p>devoting himself to his own improvement, that was probably a groundless
        <p></p>fear.
        <p></p>Though it's also true that things are all the more frustrating because of
        <p></p>all that.
        <p></p>Chitose also knew that Amane, who was trying to improve himself,
        <p></p>didn't want to confess his feelings to Mahiru just yet. Chitose didn't know
        <p></p>whether she ought to sympathize with Mahiru, who was trying to charm
        <p></p>Amane, or with Amane, who was head over heels for Mahiru and yet was
        <p></p>convinced that his rational mind was being shaken apart by her efforts to
        <p></p>appeal to him.
        <p></p>In either case, the two of them didn't seem as if they were going to come
        <p></p>clean with each other any time soon, so it was frustrating to watch them
        <p></p>steadfastly continue to not get together.
        <p></p>For the time being, Chitose slapped Amane firmly on the back in a show
        <p></p>of support.
        <p></p>He glared at her, his eyes asking why she did that, and Chitose answered
        <p></p>with a cackling laugh.
        <p></p>"You got some kind of problem?" he asked.
        <p></p>"Nah, just thinking that you sure are awfully serious and earnest,
        <p></p>Amane. By the way, what do you like best about dear Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Huh?!"
        <p></p>When she took the opportunity to ask something that she had been
        <p></p>curious about, Amane opened his eyes wide and flapped his mouth open
        <p></p>and closed in an expression of shock.
        <p></p>He was more surprised than she had expected. She had previously tried
        <p></p>to avoid asking such things directly, but now that Amane had properly
        <p></p>recognized his feelings and was working on making positive changes, she
        <p></p>figured it was all right to ask.
        <p></p>Chitose could see that Amane had never expected to be asked that so
        <p></p>suddenly, and she cackled again and waved her hand.
        <p></p>"I'm not going to tell Mahiru or anything. I wouldn't do anything that
        <p></p>crazy. I just thought you were pretty straitlaced and kind of a misanthrope…
        <p></p>I mean, a highly wary person, so I was wondering what it was you liked
        <p></p>about her."
        <p></p>"…Any reason I need to tell you that?"
        <p></p>"Well, not really, but I'm just curious. Everyone likes Mahiru, but I
        <p></p>figured you probably don't have the same reasons as the rest of them. I
        <p></p>guess you could say I'm curious because I'm friends with both of you."
        <p></p>Mahiru was cute. She was popular with the boys, and even from the
        <p></p>perspective of a member of the same sex like Chitose, her mannerisms,
        <p></p>appearance, and personality were all obviously appealing.
        <p></p>If Chitose had asked the other students at school what they liked about
        <p></p>Mahiru, most of them would have answered, as expected, that they liked her
        <p></p>because she was a picture-perfect girl, an angel who was good at school and
        <p></p>sports, who was gentle and kind toward everyone, and who treated
        <p></p>everyone equally.
        <p></p>Chitose knew Mahiru quite well, and the picture she had of her was
        <p></p>rather different from the boys who did not really know her.
        <p></p>And since Amane knew Mahiru even better than Chitose, his ideas of
        <p></p>what kind of girl Mahiru was and what he liked about her ought to have
        <p></p>been different than hers.
        <p></p>This time, she looked at Amane without any teasing. He frowned and
        <p></p>looked as if he was thinking hard, then lowered his gaze, with a troubled
        <p></p>expression.
        <p></p>"…It's hard to answer…exactly what it is I like about her. I think I like
        <p></p>everything, all together."
        <p></p>In a sense, his answer, given after some thought, was just what she had
        <p></p>expected.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru's not as perfect as everybody thinks. She seems reserved, but
        <p></p>she can be really stubborn, and sometimes she's got a sharp tongue. She
        <p></p>judges things ruthlessly, without hesitation or compromise. She pouts and
        <p></p>sulks at weird times, then headbutts me or punches me repeatedly. She
        <p></p>totally lets her guard down and falls asleep wherever she is, then gets
        <p></p>frightened when she has a nightmare… It's obvious if you take a close look
        <p></p>at her, but she's an ordinary girl."
        <p></p>Amane's expression as he quietly listed off trait after trait was utterly
        <p></p>affectionate. Chitose was certain he was calling an image of Mahiru to mind
        <p></p>as he spoke.
        <p></p>"…I don't know how much you've heard about her past, Chitose. She
        <p></p>always hides it with a smile, but she's a lonely person at heart, and because
        <p></p>of that, I think she's timid about reaching out to others. I told her she can
        <p></p>rely on me, but she's the type who's not sure how to rely on anyone, or how
        <p></p>much she can rely on them, so she retreats into herself and endures the
        <p></p>stress alone. You could say she puts on a show of courage."
        <p></p>Chitose also understood that, more or less.
        <p></p>Mahiru wouldn't lean on Chitose when she was having a really hard
        <p></p>time. She had seen her try to swallow unpleasant feelings without letting
        <p></p>them show on the surface.
        <p></p>"When she first started taking care of me, I felt like I wanted to cherish
        <p></p>her and be by her side. Which I think is probably different than wanting to
        <p></p>protect her. I mean, I want to protect her from unnecessary and
        <p></p>unreasonable suffering, but…how can I put this? …I felt like I wanted to
        <p></p>snuggle up close beside Mahiru, who always puts on a strong face and is
        <p></p>bad at relying on others and is easily frightened and tends to get lonely."
        <p></p>Amane spoke in a quiet tone of voice and lowered his gaze as he spoke
        <p></p>at length about treasuring a certain girl who was not present.
        <p></p>"…I want her to smile; I want to support her by her side. I want to be
        <p></p>there for her even when things are tough. I want us to overcome difficulties
        <p></p>together. Whenever Mahiru wants to cry, I want to stop her and help bear
        <p></p>her suffering."
        <p></p>Then he lifted his face, and even Chitose had to stare straight at Amane,
        <p></p>whose eyes clearly housed a gentle yet certain sense of purpose.
        <p></p>"To answer your question of what I like about her, I like everything.
        <p></p>Everything, her strong points and weak points; it's all wonderful… And
        <p></p>that's my reason. What's wrong with that?"
        <p></p>Amane turned away, his cheeks faintly flushed, perhaps from
        <p></p>embarrassment at spelling it all out. Chitose's lips naturally arched up in a
        <p></p>gentle smile.
        <p></p>Wow, even Mahiru would be charmed by that, huh?
        <p></p>He was a guy who respected and valued her to that degree. Mahiru
        <p></p>probably fell for him as hard as she did precisely because she picked up on
        <p></p>that.
        <p></p>Chitose felt that the two of them were bound to fall in love with each
        <p></p>other. She followed Amane as he moved over to the park fountain to try to
        <p></p>do something about his increasingly red cheeks.
        <p></p>"Hey, Amane?"
        <p></p>She spoke to Amane, who was cooling his bright-red face, rinsing the
        <p></p>sweat off with rough movements. He glared back at her, perhaps because he
        <p></p>hadn't been able to shake all the embarrassment yet.
        <p></p>"What? Don't you dare tell me I stink."
        <p></p>"Of course not, I would never say something so rude! I just, well, I'm
        <p></p>glad I'm friends with you, Amane."
        <p></p>"…Why would you say that all of a sudden? It's embarrassing."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, I just thought it!"
        <p></p>Just thought I would let you know.
        <p></p>Chitose herself was different. She had gotten to know lots of people and
        <p></p>made all sorts of friends, but even among all the different personalities she
        <p></p>had seen so far, she genuinely felt glad to have met Amane. He would never
        <p></p>bump Itsuki out of first place, but she thought she might rank Amane close
        <p></p>behind.
        <p></p>Seriously, if he would just be up-front with Mahiru about what he just
        <p></p>told me, they'd be together in a split second.
        <p></p>Even Chitose felt her cheeks grow warm after hearing about his
        <p></p>passionate feelings of love. Amane had such earnest, unwavering feelings
        <p></p>for Mahiru that Chitose suspected her friend would turn bright red and
        <p></p>collapse on the spot if she ever heard about them.
        <p></p>Chitose reached the conclusion that it was ultimately going to be an
        <p></p>irritating waiting game, and she laughed to herself. Amane gave her a
        <p></p>puzzled look, but Chitose didn't pay it any mind as she happily chuckled
        <p></p>and lightly smacked Amane's back.
        <p></p>The slap meant both good luck and tell her soon.
        <p></p>"All right, time for me to get going. Oh, that's right. You'd better not eat
        <p></p>too much at dinner. There's gonna be dessert."
        <p></p>Chitose was on her way to Mahiru's house to make sweets, and she was
        <p></p>sure they would be offered to Amane after dinner.
        <p></p>Chitose was already feeling a tiny bit of heartburn even though she
        <p></p>hadn't even arrived at Mahiru's place yet, much less made the sweets. She
        <p></p>laughed once more at Amane, who didn't seem to know what to make of
        <p></p>her, and dashed off.
        <p></p>"Ah, so this is why the two of them are…"
        <p></p>Musing that it was truly a difficult thing to watch over her friends'
        <p></p>romance without saying things she shouldn't, Chitose headed for Mahiru's
        <p></p>apartment in high spirits.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 81: Even the Angel Is Bad at Some Things 
        <p></p>Amane was, if anything, a person of leisure.
        <p></p>That was because, unlike other students, he didn't take part in club
        <p></p>activities, and he didn't work a part-time job, either. On top of that, he lived
        <p></p>alone but had been eating dinner with Mahiru, which reduced the time he
        <p></p>spent on housework.
        <p></p>Of course, he never slacked off at his studies, and he did a decent,
        <p></p>average job at cleaning now that he had learned the ropes from Mahiru, and
        <p></p>he kept his apartment neat and tidy. Plus, he exercised every day in his
        <p></p>efforts to remake himself.
        <p></p>Though he had more to do than the other students in the go-home club
        <p></p>who lived with their parents, Amane was nevertheless, if anything, a person
        <p></p>of leisure. He also had a higher degree of freedom than those students who
        <p></p>lived under their parents' roofs, considering he had no parents ordering him
        <p></p>around in his day-to-day life.
        <p></p>That's why Amane once again found himself with a surplus of time on
        <p></p>his hands.
        <p></p>He had already finished all his schoolwork, so he did his weight training
        <p></p>as soon as he woke up, then took care of the shopping in the morning when
        <p></p>he went out jogging.
        <p></p>He had started paying attention to the housework on a daily basis, so
        <p></p>even on days off, there was no need to do any large-scale cleaning, and he
        <p></p>could keep his place tidy with a little routine maintenance.
        <p></p>By three in the afternoon, Amane was ready to relax and enjoy some
        <p></p>video games.
        <p></p>He had moved the low table out of the way so he could play more
        <p></p>comfortably, and he had taken up his usual position in front of the
        <p></p>television, sitting on a fluffy rug that he had washed and de-fuzzed the other
        <p></p>day.
        <p></p>It's been a while since I did this.
        <p></p>The game he had booted up was a side-scrolling action game featuring a
        <p></p>cute pastel-pink character with a nearly spherical body that he had to guide
        <p></p>through each stage.
        <p></p>It was a game that had gone on sale many years earlier, and Amane had
        <p></p>cleared it countless times. The fact that he could play it through every time
        <p></p>without getting bored spoke to the fun of the gameplay.
        <p></p>Amane rarely replayed games with involved storylines, because he was
        <p></p>satisfied with them once he cleared them the first time. At most, he could
        <p></p>play through them twice. The second time through, he would exhaust all the
        <p></p>elements the game had to offer, and after that, he would rarely feel like
        <p></p>playing the game again.
        <p></p>I don't care what anyone says. I can always enjoy an action game that
        <p></p>handles so intuitively, Amane thought earnestly.
        <p></p>As Amane was enjoying the stream of cheerful melodies and bright
        <p></p>graphics, Mahiru sat down quietly beside him.
        <p></p>Recently, Mahiru had been spending at least one day each weekend at
        <p></p>Amane's place, and she was with him that day, too, after making lunch for
        <p></p>the two of them.
        <p></p>They didn't necessarily always pay attention to each other just because
        <p></p>they were together, and they often spent time doing their own things, so
        <p></p>even when Amane was playing a video game, Mahiru often did something
        <p></p>else, but…that day, she seemed to be interested in the game.
        <p></p>Mahiru brought a cushion over, took a seat beside Amane, and sat
        <p></p>looking at the television screen.
        <p></p>"Is this fun?"
        <p></p>"I wouldn't be playing it if it wasn't."
        <p></p>"I guess that's true. There's a cute character moving about, so it just
        <p></p>caught my interest."
        <p></p>The player character in the game was very cute, so Amane could
        <p></p>understand why it had caught Mahiru's attention, since she liked adorable
        <p></p>things.
        <p></p>"This is your kind of cute, isn't it, Mahiru? This character is really
        <p></p>popular and gets made into a ton of toys and stuff, so I think it was designed
        <p></p>to be easy to like."
        <p></p>"I mean, it's got big round eyes, and it looks squishy and cute."
        <p></p>"Yeah, true, but the stuff it's doing is pretty demonic. It's surprisingly
        <p></p>brutal. There's absolutely no mercy when it takes down enemies."
        <p></p>"Oh…?"
        <p></p>The way Amane was playing, he was purposely holding back and
        <p></p>avoiding making careless attacks, so from Mahiru's perspective, it must
        <p></p>have just looked like the cute character was moving around, bouncing
        <p></p>through the air, and crossing paths with crowds of enemies.
        <p></p>Once he revealed the character's signature method of attack, it wouldn't
        <p></p>seem so cute.
        <p></p>It literally sucked in enemies, stole their power, and used it to defeat
        <p></p>them.
        <p></p>The enemies that the player character sucked in never regained their
        <p></p>original form, and the player could swap powers if there was an enemy with
        <p></p>a better ability. Any discarded abilities got discharged as bundles of energy
        <p></p>and eventually disappeared.
        <p></p>The impression that the game gave was superficially cute, but it was
        <p></p>actually kind of horrifying if you took a minute to think hard about it.
        <p></p>Seeing it laid out like that, a game where you defeated enemies with
        <p></p>conventional weapons seemed less brutal somehow.
        <p></p>"You have a real weakness for cute things, huh, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"…Is that a bad thing?"
        <p></p>"No, I think it's cute."
        <p></p>"…I feel like you're making fun of me."
        <p></p>That hadn't been his intention, but she seemed to have taken it that way.
        <p></p>Mahiru stuck her pink lip out a little bit in an expression of dissatisfaction.
        <p></p>Though Amane thought that she looked even cuter like that, he had a
        <p></p>feeling that his next comment would get him slapped, so he swallowed his
        <p></p>words and resumed his game without saying anything.
        <p></p>The character with the cute body bounced through the level, passing
        <p></p>through openings between enemies. Mahiru watched with some excitement,
        <p></p>and Amane found himself smiling as well.
        <p></p>"If you're interested, want to try it?" Amane asked, expecting that she
        <p></p>might want to try playing, if the game had drawn her interest. Mahiru
        <p></p>seemed to be unexpectedly brimming with curiosity.
        <p></p>"Is that all right?" Mahiru asked timidly, in a quiet voice.
        <p></p>"If it wasn't, I wouldn't have said anything. Plus, I have fun just
        <p></p>watching, so go ahead."
        <p></p>"…Well then, I'll give it a try."
        <p></p>Her curiosity seemed to win out over her reservations, and with some
        <p></p>hesitation, Mahiru accepted the controller that Amane offered to her.
        <p></p>To start with, he had her select the first stage as a kind of tutorial and
        <p></p>explained how to operate the buttons as well as a summary of the special
        <p></p>characteristics of the player character, then left her to her own devices, but
        <p></p>—
        <p></p>Immediately, she looked as if she was about to cry.
        <p></p>The same thing had happened once when he let her play a racing game.
        <p></p>It was sad to say, but Mahiru was extremely bad at video games.
        <p></p>It wasn't that she made absolutely no progress, but she was the type to
        <p></p>take a great deal of time before taking the next step forward, and though she
        <p></p>got the basics and had the ability to learn, for some reason, it wasn't
        <p></p>reflected in her gameplay.
        <p></p>To Amane, who could pretty much figure out most games the first time
        <p></p>he played them, Mahiru seemed like a very strange creature.
        <p></p>"I don't understand how you've managed to die so much."
        <p></p>"I don't understand, either."
        <p></p>"I'm pretty sure you've got good hand-eye coordination, but…"
        <p></p>"Ughhh!"
        <p></p>"I think you just have to get used to playing? It's not really an issue if
        <p></p>you can't get it."
        <p></p>For Amane, games were nothing more than entertainment, and enjoying
        <p></p>them was the most important thing, since that was what they were for.
        <p></p>Mahiru had no obligation to play, and it wouldn't cause any problems if
        <p></p>she couldn't master the game. No one would criticize her for being unable
        <p></p>to do it—Amane certainly had no intention of doing so.
        <p></p>And yet Mahiru narrowed her eyes and glared slightly at the game
        <p></p>screen.
        <p></p>"…Isn't it frustrating when you can't do something?" she muttered.
        <p></p>Mahiru was right; it was frustrating.
        <p></p>"You do hate losing to things like this, huh? All right, then. Do your
        <p></p>best."
        <p></p>If she wanted to play, Amane wasn't going to stop her.
        <p></p>Though he decided he might intervene if she kept going for a long time,
        <p></p>an hour at most.
        <p></p>They had time to kill, and if Mahiru said she wanted to keep playing, he
        <p></p>would leave her to it. Even if she couldn't beat the game, it wasn't as if
        <p></p>there was anything at stake.
        <p></p>Mahiru gripped the controller with renewed motivation, but then she
        <p></p>glanced over at him as if she wanted something.
        <p></p>"…Amane, please teach me. In detail this time."
        <p></p>"Sure thing."
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to have decided that it would be best for someone who
        <p></p>could already do it to teach her exactly how to do it first, and she asked
        <p></p>Amane for another round of instruction, so he readily agreed.
        <p></p>…Amane realized that he had agreed too hastily when Mahiru stood up
        <p></p>and reseated herself in the gap between his loosely crossed legs.
        <p></p>Not paying him any mind when he froze from this all-too-sudden
        <p></p>development, Mahiru sat down with her arms around her knees, nimbly
        <p></p>avoiding Amane's legs as she found a spot for herself.
        <p></p>"Why?"
        <p></p>"If you're going to teach me the skills to play, I think it will be more
        <p></p>efficient to have you actually move my hands on the buttons. That would be
        <p></p>hard to do sitting beside each other, so this is the only way."
        <p></p>He understood that it would be easier for her to learn to use the
        <p></p>controller if they sat close together and he gave her a detailed
        <p></p>demonstration. But his responsible side warned him that this would
        <p></p>definitely cause problems for him, and it would be hard for him to focus.
        <p></p>They were extremely close together. They had hugged before, but this
        <p></p>seemed to be a different sort of closeness.
        <p></p>At the moment, he was leaning back on his hands, so their bodies
        <p></p>weren't in real contact, but if he leaned forward just a little, their torsos
        <p></p>would touch, and he would likely bump the back of Mahiru's head with his
        <p></p>face.
        <p></p>If he placed his hands on the controller that Mahiru was holding, he
        <p></p>would end up embracing her from behind.
        <p></p>"…Uh, I'm not sure about that—"
        <p></p>"So what do I do?"
        <p></p>Ah, she's not going to listen!
        <p></p>Amane put his head in his hand when Mahiru purposely ignored his
        <p></p>comment. He was worried he had a headache coming on, but he probably
        <p></p>should have been more concerned about the pain in his heart than in his
        <p></p>head at that moment.
        <p></p>How had his fun weekend game time transformed into such delightful,
        <p></p>distressing torture?
        <p></p>If he could have been honest about his desires and happily embraced
        <p></p>Mahiru, this would have been a great moment. But Amane's reason and
        <p></p>common sense wouldn't let him, so this felt like a new type of bullying, like
        <p></p>being forced to wait while a tasty morsel was dangled right before his eyes.
        <p></p>And yet he couldn't definitively say that it was unpleasant. Plus, Mahiru
        <p></p>was relying on him without any ulterior motives. She trusted Amane, which
        <p></p>was why she had installed herself on his lap.
        <p></p>In other words, Amane would need to endure it.
        <p></p>"Did you hear me?"
        <p></p>"I heard you, princess."
        <p></p>Whatever happens, happens, he thought, giving in. He hoped she would
        <p></p>forgive him.
        <p></p>In response to Mahiru's urgent tone of voice, Amane carefully bolstered
        <p></p>his armor of reason then lightly placed his own hands on top of Mahiru's,
        <p></p>which were holding the controller.
        <p></p>Mahiru's sweet, somewhat invigorating aroma gently wafted up at him,
        <p></p>causing a major momentary tremor in his sense of reason. But somehow he
        <p></p>suppressed the urge to embrace her and managed to leave a gap between
        <p></p>them as he wrapped his arms around her.
        <p></p>His painstaking efforts to sit in a way that wouldn't be objectionable all
        <p></p>came to nothing when Mahiru leaned right back onto him.
        <p></p>"I keep getting 'game over' in the same spot, so what's the best way to
        <p></p>deal with it?"
        <p></p>"…Indeed, whatever shall we do?"
        <p></p>"Why are you talking weird?"
        <p></p>Holding back his desire to ask her pointedly whose fault that might be,
        <p></p>Amane looked down at Mahiru, who was relaxing against him.
        <p></p>Her small body fit easily within Amane's arms, as if it was completely
        <p></p>natural for her to be there. Amane thought they were dangerously close, but
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem bothered, so he seemed to be the only one aware of it.
        <p></p>…She doesn't me as a man, does she?
        <p></p>As he was thinking that in deadly earnest, he flung his other thoughts—
        <p></p>the inexcusable ideas that arose in response to Mahiru's expectations as she
        <p></p>leaned against him—out of his head, and he tried to not be aware of them as
        <p></p>he guided her hands, giving her instructions for the game.
        <p></p>Amane tried to convince himself that she was just some kid from the
        <p></p>neighborhood and decided to support Mahiru's movements as she operated
        <p></p>the game the best she could.
        <p></p>"So you should watch how the enemies move. These guys only move
        <p></p>however they're programmed to move, so once you see their regular
        <p></p>pattern, you can defeat them."
        <p></p>"I can't see it; that's why I'm struggling."
        <p></p>"It's just a matter of practice. Here, try it now."
        <p></p>"…Why did I just get 'game over'? He didn't hit me."
        <p></p>"Sorry, but yes, he did. I saw it.
        <p></p>"…But I dodged it perfectly!"
        <p></p>"Don't pout, don't pout. Look, you can start the stage over from the
        <p></p>beginning."
        <p></p>Once he got used to the situation, his amusement at Mahiru's lack of
        <p></p>skill won out over his awareness of her proximity, so with quiet relief, he
        <p></p>showed her how to defeat the game's enemies.
        <p></p>"There…see, you did it! Yeah, yeah, good. Great job."
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem to mind the repetitious practice, and she slowly
        <p></p>learned how to do it after trying again and again. When she succeeded,
        <p></p>Amane praised her highly.
        <p></p>He gave his praise gently, almost in a whisper, fearing he would be too
        <p></p>loud if he raised his voice so close to her.
        <p></p>Mahiru let out a quiet groan.
        <p></p>"Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"N-nothing. Umm…that, uh, d-didn't really go so well, huh?"
        <p></p>It was unlike her to become so flustered, but what she was saying wasn't
        <p></p>particularly strange, so Amane let it go as just one of those things.
        <p></p>"Well, I think things like this are a matter of practice. I bet you just need
        <p></p>to do it a few more times. If you're not having fun, you can just stop—"
        <p></p>"That's not true!"
        <p></p>"O-oh, really? That's fine, then…"
        <p></p>Amane flinched when Mahiru suddenly raised her voice, but as
        <p></p>bewildered as he was, Mahiru looked even more perplexed, and she hung
        <p></p>her head.
        <p></p>"…I'm ashamed of how careless and foolish I'm being."
        <p></p>"Don't beat yourself up so much about a silly game."
        <p></p>"That's not what I mean, but…it's fine."
        <p></p>"Uhhh…?"
        <p></p>Ultimately, all Amane could do was tilt his head in confusion. He wasn't
        <p></p>sure what she was talking about. Mahiru didn't seem inclined to answer
        <p></p>Amane's unspoken question; instead, she hung her head and hugged her
        <p></p>knees.
        <p></p>"…Um, Amane, teaching me like this…you…don't find it unpleasant?"
        <p></p>Eventually, a quiet inquiry was put forth.
        <p></p>"Not at all. Just, well, we're a little close… I was wondering if you
        <p></p>might be finding it unpleasant."
        <p></p>"Why would I, when I'm the one who chose to sit like this?"
        <p></p>"Well, um…it's a little dangerous? I might touch something I
        <p></p>shouldn't?"
        <p></p>The way they were sitting at the moment, Amane could have easily
        <p></p>embraced her tightly, and if he'd wanted to, he could have slipped his hands
        <p></p>into places they shouldn't go.
        <p></p>Since Amane didn't want her to hate him, and since he thought that sort
        <p></p>of thing was for lovers to do together, he didn't have the slightest intention
        <p></p>of laying an indecent hand on her, but not having such intentions was a
        <p></p>different thing from not being on guard against it.
        <p></p>As always, Mahiru was not wary enough around Amane.
        <p></p>"…Are you going to?"
        <p></p>In response to Amane's words, Mahiru leaned back against him and
        <p></p>looked up at him.
        <p></p>Her clear, caramel-colored eyes hid a mischievous twinkle. Her cheeks,
        <p></p>which looked more flushed than usual, softened as she smiled.
        <p></p>Faced with that teasing expression, Amane purposely puckered up his
        <p></p>face and grabbed her tender-looking cheeks.
        <p></p>"Nope."
        <p></p>"Uahhh!"
        <p></p>He chided her that there were things that were and were not okay to say,
        <p></p>even as a joke, as he squished and pulled Mahiru's cheeks like soft rice
        <p></p>cakes. In response, he got a goofy, high-pitched shriek.
        <p></p>Wholeheartedly relieved that her squealing had no sex appeal, Amane
        <p></p>took several slow, deep breaths to calm his heart before it pounded out of
        <p></p>his chest.
        <p></p>…My heart can't take this.
        <p></p>Without a doubt, she must have been teasing him on purpose.
        <p></p>Amane sighed as he pinched her soft cheeks, thinking about how skilled
        <p></p>she was at getting a rise out of people. In his arms, Mahiru grumbled in
        <p></p>complaint, "How long are you gonna do that? Geez…"
        <p></p>They eventually pulled themselves together and continued playing the
        <p></p>game, but after two continuous hours of play, they were forced to accept
        <p></p>that Mahiru was not suited for action games.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 82: A Sleepover and a Story from the Past 
        <p></p>"You know, Mahiru, your skin is so pretty."
        <p></p>Mahiru heard the faint sound of skin breaking the surface of the water as
        <p></p>Chitose submerged herself right in front of Mahiru and quietly mumbled
        <p></p>this compliment.
        <p></p>The bathtub, which was spacious when Mahiru was alone, felt a little
        <p></p>small with two people in it.
        <p></p>But Mahiru had gotten so used to Chitose's presence that being a bit
        <p></p>cramped felt cozy.
        <p></p>Chitose, who had come to stay over on the weekend, had wanted to take
        <p></p>a bath, so with no reason to decline, Mahiru had agreed. But even with
        <p></p>another girl, she didn't love the idea of being looked at.
        <p></p>The only reason she didn't feel too uncomfortable was probably because
        <p></p>the person looking was Chitose, who offered her pure admiration.
        <p></p>"Thank you very much. If it looks that way, I guess that means my
        <p></p>efforts are worth it."
        <p></p>There was no being modest in the bath, so Mahiru nodded and simply
        <p></p>accepted the compliment.
        <p></p>She was the type of person who was willing to put in the work and who
        <p></p>always held herself to a high standard, so naturally she took good care of
        <p></p>her skin.
        <p></p>Mahiru went out of her way to dress herself in clothes that were nice to
        <p></p>the touch and made of materials that were gentle on the skin. She believed
        <p></p>that a beautiful body started from the inside, so she paid attention to the
        <p></p>nutritional balance of her meals and made sure to get plenty of sleep. She
        <p></p>was careful not to get dehydrated or sunburned, and she avoided exposing
        <p></p>her unprotected skin to ultraviolet rays.
        <p></p>She always kept clean, and after washing gently and carefully in the
        <p></p>bath, not scrubbing too hard so that she didn't damage her skin, she applied
        <p></p>toners and lotions as well as oils after getting out, to lock in plenty of
        <p></p>hydration and stay moisturized.
        <p></p>By doing all that together, she kept her skin springy, smooth, and soft.
        <p></p>She couldn't slack off just because she was young. Beauty was
        <p></p>something deliberate, an ephemeral thing that could crumble away if she
        <p></p>didn't put in the effort. That was a lesson from her housekeeper, Miss
        <p></p>Koyuki.
        <p></p>Thinking about all the effort she put in, Mahiru accepted the praise as
        <p></p>well-deserved. Chitose's gaze made her a little embarrassed when it fell on
        <p></p>her face and her chest where it was sticking out of the water, as well as the
        <p></p>parts that were under the water's surface, but she wasn't going to rebuke her
        <p></p>friend for looking.
        <p></p>Still, she didn't like being stared at.
        <p></p>"…It's so smooth and milky white. I've got a little bit of a tan,
        <p></p>unfortunately. I'm jealous."
        <p></p>"I don't think you should be jealous. Sure, you've got more color than
        <p></p>me because you spend more time outside, but I think it's a healthy,
        <p></p>attractive color. If I got any paler, I'd look ill."
        <p></p>Chitose really did have a nice, healthy complexion, though unlike
        <p></p>Mahiru, she didn't make it her mission to completely avoid the sun, so she
        <p></p>wasn't so pale that her veins showed through.
        <p></p>Mahiru turned red if she ever got a lot of sun and went through hell until
        <p></p>it healed, which was why she was so cautious, so she actually felt slightly
        <p></p>envious of skin like Chitose's.
        <p></p>Chitose had called Mahiru pretty, but from Mahiru's perspective,
        <p></p>Chitose's lean, graceful figure was just as attractive.
        <p></p>Chitose had mentioned that she found it difficult to put on weight, and
        <p></p>Mahiru knew that Chitose exercised, but even so, to a girl like Mahiru, not
        <p></p>having to pay attention to calories despite eating a lot sounded like the
        <p></p>ideal.
        <p></p>"I know everyone wants what they can't have, but seriously I'm really
        <p></p>jealous of you, Mahiru. Of course, I'm sure that the upkeep must be a total
        <p></p>pain. No amount of effort on my part is going to change the skin color and
        <p></p>chest I was born with, I guess."
        <p></p>Chitose went on to bemoan the fact that her chest wouldn't get any
        <p></p>bigger no matter what she did, and Mahiru could do nothing but frown.
        <p></p>There were genetic factors at play, so Mahiru knew it wasn't her place to
        <p></p>say anything, and she thought that any comment would sound offensive,
        <p></p>since she understood what her own figure looked like.
        <p></p>She gently pinned down the bulges that felt a little lighter than usual
        <p></p>because they were underwater and let out a quiet sigh into the bathwater.
        <p></p>When it came to her chest, Mahiru was already well-developed, so she
        <p></p>didn't have much to complain about.
        <p></p>In fact, she'd had trouble figuring out the right size underwear once she
        <p></p>hit puberty. And she had had to put up with rude stares all through
        <p></p>elementary and middle school.
        <p></p>But that wasn't the sort of information that Chitose would find helpful.
        <p></p>"Itsuki's always making fun of me for it, can you believe that? I get
        <p></p>enough to eat, and they get massaged plenty, but they won't get any bigger,
        <p></p>so I don't know what else to do. I can't let him at them any more than I
        <p></p>already do, so I'm just gonna say it's his fault."
        <p></p>"I don't think you ought to talk about such things so openly!"
        <p></p>"It's just you and me, Mahiru, so no worries, no worries… Mahiru, you
        <p></p>can relax, you know. Guys usually like big ones."
        <p></p>"That is not relaxing information, and it's not necessarily the case that
        <p></p>Amane likes big ones!"
        <p></p>"I didn't say a thing about Amane, now did I?"
        <p></p>"Ah—"
        <p></p>"Okay, I get it, stop attacking me with your army of ducks!" Chitose
        <p></p>cried with a satisfied smile on her face.
        <p></p>When Mahiru vented her anger by shoving the ducks that were floating
        <p></p>on the bathwater at her, Chitose seemed to just enjoy herself even more.
        <p></p>Mahiru glared at her in irritation, but the smile on Chitose's face never
        <p></p>abated.
        <p></p>"You're awfully attuned to the preferences of the guy you like, huh?"
        <p></p>"…I think Amane is the kind of person who doesn't care about body
        <p></p>type."
        <p></p>"Sure, well, I think that he probably doesn't care once he already likes
        <p></p>someone, but even so, I'm pretty sure bigger is better. I don't think you
        <p></p>have to worry about that, though, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"…Amane is not that big of a pervert."
        <p></p>"I think that's your own fantasy, though, Mahiru. Amane's also a…well,
        <p></p>I guess more or less, he is still a guy."
        <p></p>"Aren't you being a little harsh?"
        <p></p>"Look at how he behaves himself."
        <p></p>Judging by his typical behavior, Amane was actually quite considerate,
        <p></p>and he seemed like the perfect gentleman to Mahiru, but within the confines
        <p></p>of the current conversation, that might not actually be ideal.
        <p></p>Chitose had once referred to Amane as someone who always erred on
        <p></p>the side of caution, and he certainly did seem to be a real worrywart to
        <p></p>Mahiru. But that was something she actually liked about him, and it didn't
        <p></p>bother her.
        <p></p>Though she did worry on occasion if she might be lacking a certain
        <p></p>appeal.
        <p></p>"…Anyway, leaving aside all this talk of boobs—"
        <p></p>"You're the one who brought it up, Chitose."
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah. Anyway, you sure are pretty, Mahiru. I mean it. White as
        <p></p>an egg, you could say. How nice, to be smooth and springy and moisturized
        <p></p>and glossy and supple!"
        <p></p>"I think you're describing an egg, or maybe some kind of gelatinous
        <p></p>material?"
        <p></p>"Aren't you already jelly? You're ridiculously soft…how do you keep
        <p></p>this skin so moisturized?"
        <p></p>"I usually use toner, lotion, and oil. If you want, you could give it a try,
        <p></p>too, Chitose? Though I don't know whether it will be right for your skin."
        <p></p>The skin-care products Mahiru used cost quite a bit of money, and they
        <p></p>were all very high quality. But that didn't necessarily mean they were
        <p></p>compatible with someone else's skin. It was a matter of individual
        <p></p>physiology, so it wasn't necessarily true that the products Mahiru used
        <p></p>would be good for Chitose. But she could try them and go from there.
        <p></p>"Could I? Beauty Salon Mahiru is open for business?"
        <p></p>"It's not that big of a deal. You just smear it on and then massage it in;
        <p></p>you can do it yourself. I'm sure you don't want me putting my hands all
        <p></p>over you."
        <p></p>"Wait, but I'm just fine with touching you and getting touched by you,
        <p></p>Mahiru. Actually, I want to touch."
        <p></p>"…Where are you planning on touching?"
        <p></p>Chitose's gaze shifted down to Mahiru's body, so she quickly covered
        <p></p>herself with both arms, but Chitose cackled with laughter and waved a hand
        <p></p>in front of her.
        <p></p>"Just joking, just joking. Of course, if someone's touching you, that'll be
        <p></p>Amane, right?"
        <p></p>"…Chitose."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, you can't frighten me, not with that bright-red face. You just
        <p></p>end up looking cute instead… I get it already, stop glaring at me!"
        <p></p>"And just whose fault is that?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, yeah… But seriously, in a way, it's really impressive that Amane
        <p></p>can pull himself away without letting anything show on his face, when you
        <p></p>squish these things against him."
        <p></p>"It's not like I've been squishing them against him on purpose, though."
        <p></p>"Uh-huh, I've watched you do it and seeing that made me think you're a
        <p></p>natural seductress."
        <p></p>"It's not natural, either."
        <p></p>"Sure, sure, whatever you say."
        <p></p>Chitose's knowing grin pierced Mahiru's heart, so even though she
        <p></p>wanted to object, Chitose didn't seem likely to hear what she had to say.
        <p></p>She formed her face into a discontented pout, but that only made Chitose
        <p></p>smirk even harder.
        <p></p>There was no way she could hold her own against Chitose, so Mahiru
        <p></p>stopped trying to hide and let out a big sigh.
        <p></p>"Well, Amane never makes a move unless he gets a push, so I think
        <p></p>you're doing the right thing, putting the pressure on. I think you'll be happy
        <p></p>with the results if you keep on pushing until you see the wolf inside."
        <p></p>Just as Mahiru was thinking it was about time to get out of the bath,
        <p></p>since she was feeling flushed from Chitose teasing her about all sorts of
        <p></p>things that she didn't consider to be joking matters, Chitose spoke to her not
        <p></p>in a teasing manner, but in a gentle tone of voice.
        <p></p>I don't think that Amane has got a wolf inside him…
        <p></p>She did actually think that Amane was someone with wolflike qualities,
        <p></p>but not in the way Chitose was thinking.
        <p></p>Wolves are devoted creatures that care for members of their pack and
        <p></p>form strong bonds with their mates.
        <p></p>A person who was kind and thoughtful to the very end once you were in
        <p></p>his circle—that was Mahiru's impression of Amane.
        <p></p>Thinking about how she wished she could form that kind of bond with
        <p></p>Amane, she retrieved the skin toner that she had laid out, rubbed it in her
        <p></p>hands, and slid it over her body.
        <p></p>She wasn't quite out of the bath yet. Before stepping into the changing
        <p></p>area, before drying herself with a towel, the first task in her skin-care
        <p></p>routine was to lock in the generous amount of moisture that her skin now
        <p></p>held, so she spread on the toner carefully.
        <p></p>"…Even supposing that he did turn into that wolf you're talking about, I
        <p></p>think Amane is the type of guy who would kneel and beg forgiveness
        <p></p>afterward."
        <p></p>"Ah-ha-ha, you're not wrong! He would definitely take responsibility."
        <p></p>"…Gradually chipping away at things isn't exactly my ideal, so I
        <p></p>wouldn't be too unhappy about it."
        <p></p>"You wouldn't? So you mean you'd be kind of happy to get gobbled
        <p></p>up?"
        <p></p>"I'm not loaning you any skin-care products anymore."
        <p></p>"I'm sorry, I'm sooorry!"
        <p></p>Chitose got out of the bathtub with a big grin on her face as Mahiru gave
        <p></p>her a warning in a slightly sharp tone of voice. Mahiru sighed again and
        <p></p>passed Chitose the bottle of toner.
        <p></p>After properly completing their skin-care and hair-care routines, Mahiru
        <p></p>and Chitose changed into their pajamas and were finally able to relax in the
        <p></p>bedroom.
        <p></p>Mahiru had been unable to relax in the bath because of Chitose's direct
        <p></p>and intrusive interrogation. But Chitose must have sensed Mahiru's subtle
        <p></p>signs of mental exhaustion, because she was deliberately not paying
        <p></p>attention to her and was instead smiling at herself. "My skin is so much
        <p></p>smoother than usual!"
        <p></p>Chitose was wearing a gray sweatshirt and shorts. She sat cross-legged,
        <p></p>happily rubbing her legs where they stuck out from her shorts.
        <p></p>"Wow, I feel like a twelve out of ten today!"
        <p></p>"That's great. I think you'd get an extra point if you corrected your
        <p></p>posture, though."
        <p></p>"Man, you're so strict. You never sit like this, do you, Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"If I did, you'd totally be able to see my underpants."
        <p></p>Chitose was the type to wear shorts, but Mahiru had on a nightgown
        <p></p>with long sleeves and a hem down to her ankles.
        <p></p>Even though it was fluttery and had plenty of space to spare, it wouldn't
        <p></p>be enough for her to sit cross-legged, and if she did, she would have to hike
        <p></p>it up, and that would be far too immodest.
        <p></p>Instead, Mahiru sat with both legs slightly to one side, and Chitose
        <p></p>looked at her with what seemed to be admiration.
        <p></p>"You've got a lot of pajamas like that, huh, Mahiru? I think they're cute,
        <p></p>but my big brother would laugh at me and tell me they're all wrong for me,
        <p></p>I'm sure."
        <p></p>"Can I just say, I think it's all right to let things that people with no tact
        <p></p>tell you pass right in one ear and out the other?"
        <p></p>"Oh, harsh! You're really hard on my big brother, aren't you? Though I
        <p></p>guess he did make fun of Amane, so I get why you wouldn't like him."
        <p></p>Chitose smiled and explained that he had been teasing them out of
        <p></p>affection and not malice, but Mahiru couldn't conjure much in the way of
        <p></p>good feelings when she recalled meeting Chitose's brother. Previously,
        <p></p>when they had gone over to Chitose's house to hang out, she had heard one
        <p></p>of her brothers saying insulting things about both Chitose and Amane, so
        <p></p>Mahiru could never see herself liking that older brother.
        <p></p>As far as Mahiru was concerned, he had made fun of two of her dearest
        <p></p>friends, so it was impossible for her to like him.
        <p></p>Deep down, she could have found a way to ignore him making fun of
        <p></p>Amane, because he didn't really know him. But the things he'd said about
        <p></p>Chitose were a different matter.
        <p></p>She knew that Chitose's older brother had only used such indelicate
        <p></p>words toward Chitose because they were family, but even so, there were
        <p></p>things that were okay to say and things that were not. Chitose always
        <p></p>laughed and said she was used to it, but even she had to be hurt by it.
        <p></p>It was unthinkable that Mahiru would hold any goodwill toward a
        <p></p>person who could misjudge that.
        <p></p>"…If I had to say, the thing I disliked about him was the way he treated
        <p></p>you, Chitose. And that he laughed at you after making fun of you."
        <p></p>"Huh? …Well, let me just say in his defense that I like my big brother,
        <p></p>and he's got good points, too, okay? That said, he is the type to run his
        <p></p>mouth without thinking and then feel bad after saying something uncalled
        <p></p>for. After you went home, he came and apologized to me."
        <p></p>"Even so, you seemed so sad when he was saying it, so I can't allow it. I
        <p></p>think your brother must have something wrong with his eyes. You're cute,
        <p></p>Chitose. No matter what anyone says. I guarantee it."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked straight at Chitose as she made this declaration,
        <p></p>unwilling to concede that point. Chitose looked puzzled but happy, and her
        <p></p>face curved into a smile.
        <p></p>"…You think I would look all right in a cute, fluttery thing like that?"
        <p></p>"I think it would suit you just fine. You should let me dress you up from
        <p></p>time to time. Let's throw your Mr. Akazawa for a loop."
        <p></p>"Good idea! I like the thought of shocking Itsuki."
        <p></p>Chitose looked adorable when she wore her easygoing smile. That alone
        <p></p>was enough to convince Mahiru that what her friend's brother said must be
        <p></p>wrong.
        <p></p>Chitose threw her arms around Mahiru with a gentle smile, and Mahiru
        <p></p>found herself smiling as well. She chided Chitose to cut it out but let her do
        <p></p>as she pleased.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, Mahiru, let's go buy matching pajamas together soon!"
        <p></p>"Sure, that's no problem."
        <p></p>When Mahiru readily agreed, Chitose's smile changed.
        <p></p>Mahiru had felt reassured by her friend's usual cheerful grin, but looking
        <p></p>at this new smile gave her a bad feeling for some reason.
        <p></p>"Whoo-hoo! You already agreed, so now you have to let me dress you in
        <p></p>a sheer negligee!"
        <p></p>"Hang on?! If we're matching, that means you have to put it on, too, you
        <p></p>know?!"
        <p></p>"Yeah, that's fine. Of course, I'll only wear it in front of Itsuki, though.
        <p></p>What will you do with yours?" Chitose leered in satisfaction.
        <p></p>Mahiru reflexively slapped at Chitose's thighs.
        <p></p>Chitose was still clinging to her, so she couldn't rip her away by force,
        <p></p>and smacking her was her only recourse. But Chitose didn't seem to mind.
        <p></p>"But I'm sure it'll look great on you, Mahiru! I bet you'll transform into
        <p></p>a sweet little temptress."
        <p></p>"Isn't that a contradiction?"
        <p></p>"If it is, then you're going to embody it."
        <p></p>"Who do you think I am?"
        <p></p>"You're my sweet, lovely Mahiru!"
        <p></p>"…Geez."
        <p></p>Chitose seemed to think that calling Mahiru "sweet" and "lovely" was
        <p></p>enough to earn her forgiveness. Mahiru slapped Chitose on the thigh once
        <p></p>more, then in order to drive the image she had briefly conjured of wearing a
        <p></p>negligee in front of Amane from her mind, she threw herself to the floor,
        <p></p>Chitose and all.
        <p></p>"…Come to think of it, how did you and Akazawa wind up dating,
        <p></p>Chitose?"
        <p></p>They had turned off the room's overhead light and just had the side lamp
        <p></p>on, gradually getting ready to sleep, when Mahiru hit Chitose, who was
        <p></p>lying beside her, with a question that she had been curious about.
        <p></p>Chitose was always elated to gossip about love interests when she stayed
        <p></p>over, but surprisingly, she had never thought to tell Mahiru her own story.
        <p></p>Illuminated by the faint lamplight, Chitose snapped her eyes open and
        <p></p>shut dramatically several times.
        <p></p>"Me? I don't think it's all that interesting of a story, and if anything,
        <p></p>there's probably some parts that will make you uncomfortable."
        <p></p>Chitose had already been dating Itsuki when she met Mahiru, and she
        <p></p>always talked about how close they were now, but she rarely said anything
        <p></p>about the past.
        <p></p>Mahiru had raised the question because she realized that she hadn't
        <p></p>expressly asked about it before, but Chitose didn't seem to want to
        <p></p>volunteer the story.
        <p></p>"I'm not exactly hiding anything, but…hmm. Well, I guess it would be
        <p></p>unfair not to tell you, since I'm watching your romance grow."
        <p></p>Chitose let her gaze drift around, looking not displeased but rather
        <p></p>unsure how to explain. Somehow or other, Mahiru could tell that this
        <p></p>behavior was something she did when she was remembering.
        <p></p>"Just know that it's not the sweet story you're expecting, all right,
        <p></p>Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"…As long as you don't mind telling it."
        <p></p>"Okay. Mm, how do I put this, I feel so embarrassed just thinking about
        <p></p>things from way back then. So before I was dating Itsuki, right? And I can
        <p></p>see my old self from an objective point of view now, but I was dull, I guess
        <p></p>you could say, and pretty bad at getting along with people. I wasn't
        <p></p>interested in anything but running. You know, that kind of person. And I
        <p></p>was always fighting with my brothers, so I'd say I wasn't a super-charming
        <p></p>girl.
        <p></p>"Hard to imagine, huh?" Chitose said a bit sadly when she saw Mahiru,
        <p></p>who was stiff as a statue, struggling to picture it.
        <p></p>The Chitose of the present was cheerful and friendly with everyone. She
        <p></p>was always smiling and seemed to be loved by everyone around her.
        <p></p>The Chitose of the past that she was describing sounded like her
        <p></p>complete opposite.
        <p></p>"So that's why I was always hated by this one group of upperclassmen
        <p></p>in my track club, see? Especially after I snatched one of the regulars'
        <p></p>positions. Their jealousy…I guess it was unavoidable, and it's not like I was
        <p></p>rude to them or looked down on them or anything, but there's only so much
        <p></p>you can do in school. It's a microcosm of society, after all. 'The nail that
        <p></p>sticks out gets hammered down' and all that."
        <p></p>Mahiru had had a similar experience.
        <p></p>For better or worse, Mahiru had always stood out in all sorts of ways
        <p></p>thanks to her hard work and the talents she was born with. As someone who
        <p></p>had also experienced envy and jealousy, she sympathized deeply.
        <p></p>In Chitose's case, people were jealous of her physical prowess.
        <p></p>"On top of all that, Itsuki had to go and confess his love for me. One of
        <p></p>the upperclassmen who held a real grudge against me apparently had it bad
        <p></p>for Itsuki, too. At first, I didn't really know Itsuki at all and had never
        <p></p>considered dating him, so I turned him down, but even though I rejected
        <p></p>him, from that point on, that upperclassman's harassment got really bad."
        <p></p>Chitose was telling the story now with a smile on her face, but at the
        <p></p>time, it must have been a terrible ordeal.
        <p></p>"I told him I loved running, and turned him down, and I thought that
        <p></p>was the end of it, but that upperclassman didn't like my attitude. She didn't
        <p></p>give up on Itsuki, either, so the harassment escalated in all sorts of ways,
        <p></p>you see?"
        <p></p>"That's…"
        <p></p>"Even so, I put up with it, but well, ultimately, the upperclassman
        <p></p>resorted to violence. Up until then, everything had always been indirect, but
        <p></p>that time she directly… I suspect that she herself probably didn't mean for
        <p></p>it to go so far. In the middle of practice, she deliberately injured me."
        <p></p>Without meaning to, Mahiru mumbled something about the situation
        <p></p>transcending a simple interpersonal disagreement.
        <p></p>"Well, without talking to an adviser, I don't think I'll ever know,"
        <p></p>Chitose answered with a bitter smile. Her reaction wrenched Mahiru's
        <p></p>heart.
        <p></p>"I injured my leg, the most important thing for running track, and was
        <p></p>removed from the roster right before a competition. Well, I felt like I had
        <p></p>lost my reason for living, like I had lost the place where I belonged. I was
        <p></p>so upset I skipped out on the hospital and was out there staring blankly at
        <p></p>the sports field when Itsuki came up to me to apologize. 'It was my fault,'
        <p></p>he said… It wasn't his fault at all, of course. It was all because of that
        <p></p>upperclassman, who was lashing out at me. I knew that, but still, in some
        <p></p>corner of my heart, I did think it might have been because Itsuki had
        <p></p>confessed his feelings for me. I was too ashamed of myself for thinking
        <p></p>such a thing, and I cried right there in front of Itsuki, can you believe it?
        <p></p>After crying for a while, I asked him: What did he see in me? He told me
        <p></p>that he loved my form when I was running, but I knew I might never again
        <p></p>be able to run like I had before."
        <p></p>In sports, a serious injury can make it quite difficult to make a
        <p></p>comeback, Chitose explained.
        <p></p>Even supposing that she received flawless medical treatment, her muscle
        <p></p>strength would decline due to the gap in her training. It wasn't clear
        <p></p>whether she would be able to run like she had originally, and even if she
        <p></p>did, it would take even more time.
        <p></p>Thinking realistically, it made sense that she would be removed from the
        <p></p>team roster while she was recovering, but from Chitose's perspective, it had
        <p></p>been a big enough shock that she'd felt as if she had lost her place in the
        <p></p>world.
        <p></p>But the expression that Chitose wore as she told the story could hardly
        <p></p>be called gloomy.
        <p></p>Far from it, the look in her eyes was one of nostalgia, mixed with what
        <p></p>could only be described as tender affection.
        <p></p>"Then Itsuki said, 'It doesn't matter. I love what I love.' He was so darn
        <p></p>direct and honest, I stopped crying before I knew it."
        <p></p>"…He's very passionate."
        <p></p>"Well, if he didn't really like me, he would never have approached me
        <p></p>after I brushed him off, right? Itsuki's bad at giving up when it comes to
        <p></p>things like that. Honestly, he's so straightforward and serious… Ultimately,
        <p></p>I guess you could say I was moved by his affection. When he said that he
        <p></p>loved me so earnestly, it didn't feel weird at all, and I guess that must be
        <p></p>why."
        <p></p>Chitose scratched her cheek awkwardly, then brushed back the hair that
        <p></p>was hanging over her face and slowly cast her eyes downward.
        <p></p>"So like I told you, in the beginning it wasn't pure love like what you
        <p></p>have for Amane. If you want to put it in a mean way, I was just swept off
        <p></p>my feet and accepted it. Of course now I'm totally in love with him… Do
        <p></p>you look down on me for it?"
        <p></p>"No… The path to romance is different for every person, and love takes
        <p></p>many forms. No matter what started it, as long as you and Itsuki are in love
        <p></p>with each other now and cherish each other, I think that's great."
        <p></p>To Mahiru, relationships were connections that bound together people
        <p></p>who loved one another, and she thought that people's fates could not be
        <p></p>linked by one-sided affection.
        <p></p>But she also knew that that was not all there was to it.
        <p></p>Chitose had left out the details of how she and Itsuki had connected in
        <p></p>the way she told her story, but Mahiru could tell they had taken a different
        <p></p>path than the way she imagined most couples were formed.
        <p></p>Mahiru had no intention of invalidating her friend's experience and
        <p></p>accepted it for what it was.
        <p></p>The most important thing to her was whether Chitose was happier now
        <p></p>than she had been in the past.
        <p></p>When Mahiru slowly shook her head, Chitose smiled slightly, looking
        <p></p>relieved, then casually turned over to face the ceiling and extended her
        <p></p>arms. She slowly clasped her palms together in the air, as if there were
        <p></p>something between them.
        <p></p>"…After I quit the track club, I tried to change myself. I decided to learn
        <p></p>more about the big wide world, not just running. I gained worldly wisdom.
        <p></p>It was out of self-interest, but people have a better impression of you if
        <p></p>you're smiling, and they're kinder, so that's how I made friends. I had been
        <p></p>paying the price for neglecting my relationships with other people, so I tried
        <p></p>extra hard."
        <p></p>She turned a touching gaze on Mahiru, a gaze that seemed to say I'm
        <p></p>sure you understand perfectly well what that's like, Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Well, anyway, that's the story of how me and Itsuki got to where we are
        <p></p>today. Not really the nicest story, right?"
        <p></p>"…Setting aside the question of whether or not it was pleasant, I'm a
        <p></p>little surprised to hear that Akazawa was so persistent."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh-heh. I may have changed a lot, but Itsuki's also changed, you
        <p></p>know? Thanks to his family's education plan, he used to be way too serious,
        <p></p>if anything—a real model student. Though you've seen what he's become,
        <p></p>now that he's mixed up with someone like me."
        <p></p>"…You shouldn't put yourself down like that."
        <p></p>"This is one point I won't budge on… It's only natural that Daiki would
        <p></p>hate me, you know, considering how the serious son he raised so carefully
        <p></p>ended up changing after meeting me," Chitose mumbled quietly, her words
        <p></p>probably not meant for Mahiru to hear. Her voice had a faint, sad tremble to
        <p></p>it.
        <p></p>Mahiru had picked up on the fact that there was a gulf between Chitose
        <p></p>and Itsuki's father, but it seemed to be deeper than she had assumed.
        <p></p>As an outsider, Mahiru couldn't readily fill in that gulf or build a bridge
        <p></p>across it.
        <p></p>But what she could do was snuggle up to her friend.
        <p></p>Mahiru gently brought her body closer, until she could no longer see
        <p></p>Chitose's face, and put her forehead against the other girl's arm.
        <p></p>"…Well, I like you, Chitose," she whispered quietly.
        <p></p>The body she was holding on to shook just a little.
        <p></p>"Eh-heh-heh, thanks. I like you, too, Mahiru."
        <p></p>In a sort of embrace, Chitose curled up against Mahiru's chest, but just
        <p></p>this once, Mahiru didn't prevent it and let Chitose do as she pleased.
        <p></p>"Oh-ho-ho, I'm the first person to enjoy Mahiru's softness."
        <p></p>"…Not necessarily—"
        <p></p>"Huh?! What's that mean, gimme details!"
        <p></p>"That's a secret."
        <p></p>"Oh, come on, that's not fair!"
        <p></p>They horsed around for a bit, and as she felt Chitose's warmth seeping
        <p></p>into her arms, Mahiru slowly closed her eyes.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 83: Former Regrets and Hopes for the Future 
        <p></p>These should do nicely.
        <p></p>Since his father always had something to say when Itsuki was home on
        <p></p>days he didn't work his part-time job, Itsuki had decided to save himself the
        <p></p>stress and go out, under the pretense of returning a comic book he had
        <p></p>borrowed from Amane.
        <p></p>After getting some cream puffs from one of Chitose's favorite patisseries
        <p></p>wrapped up to go as a present, he headed down the familiar road that took
        <p></p>him to Amane's apartment building.
        <p></p>He'd made sure to tell Amane that morning that he was coming to return
        <p></p>the book, so he assumed that his friend would be at home.
        <p></p>He entered the atrium and called up to Amane's unit with practiced
        <p></p>motions, idly wondering what he should get Amane to loan him next, when
        <p></p>he heard an unexpected voice on the intercom, and his body automatically
        <p></p>straightened up.
        <p></p>"Is that Akazawa?"
        <p></p>…I guess it is lunchtime on a weekend?
        <p></p>I know she's been making them dinner in the evenings, so it's not so
        <p></p>strange that she'd be there on a weekend afternoon.
        <p></p>He had heard directly from Amane that he sometimes spent his
        <p></p>weekends with Mahiru, but the idea that she was actually there in Amane's
        <p></p>apartment gave rise to some complicated, restless feelings.
        <p></p>"Oh, Miss Shiina, hello. Is Amane in?"
        <p></p>"Hello. Amane's gone out to run some errands and won't be back for
        <p></p>about another hour. He said he needed to send something at the post office,
        <p></p>then drop by the ATM and the stationery store."
        <p></p>"I see. All things he could have taken care of on a weekday… What a
        <p></p>thoughtless guy."
        <p></p>"You're quite right. I heard from Amane that you would be coming by,
        <p></p>and he gave me permission to let you in, so please come on up."
        <p></p>Amane had been aware that Itsuki was going to visit, but he must have
        <p></p>really wanted to get those errands done no matter what.
        <p></p>Itsuki would give him a good ribbing later for leaving Mahiru to handle
        <p></p>his visitors, but for the time being, he decided to take Mahiru at her word
        <p></p>and head up to the apartment.
        <p></p>"Welcome."
        <p></p>When he arrived at Amane's place, Mahiru welcomed him in as if it was
        <p></p>only natural, with the same clear voice he had just heard over the intercom.
        <p></p>She looked like she was already Amane's live-in girlfriend or wife, and
        <p></p>Itsuki couldn't help himself from quipping, "How can he not be sure if she's
        <p></p>into him, that dummy," but he mumbled it in such a quiet voice that she
        <p></p>couldn't hear him.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked confused at Itsuki, who had stiffened slightly. He smiled
        <p></p>vaguely to disguise his awkwardness, and as he took off his shoes and put
        <p></p>on the slippers that had been set out for him, he showed Mahiru the box of
        <p></p>cream puffs that he was carrying in his arms along with the comic book.
        <p></p>"Thanks for having me. Ah, these are some cream puffs I got. There's
        <p></p>enough in there for you, too, so eat them together, okay?"
        <p></p>Itsuki had bought enough for Mahiru, figuring that if Amane was eating
        <p></p>dinner with Mahiru every day, then they would have time to eat them that
        <p></p>evening, but he had never expected her to be there in the afternoon.
        <p></p>Mahiru accepted the box of cream puffs, and said bashfully, "I'm sure
        <p></p>Amane will be pleased," and gave a little bow. "Thank you, that's very
        <p></p>kind. Wait here, please, and I'll bring out some tea. Do you drink black
        <p></p>tea?"
        <p></p>"I'll drink anything. Thanks for your consideration."
        <p></p>"Not at all, you're an important guest. All right, then, wait just a minute,
        <p></p>please."
        <p></p>After showing Itsuki to the living room sofa, Mahiru went into the
        <p></p>kitchen with a gentle smile on her face.
        <p></p>She moved with such natural ease that Itsuki wasn't sure whether to be
        <p></p>impressed or astonished.
        <p></p>He mentally launched more friendly abuse at Amane for being a loser
        <p></p>who had made basically no progress despite having Mahiru so embedded in
        <p></p>his life.
        <p></p>After Itsuki had been waiting a little while, Mahiru came back holding a
        <p></p>tray on which she had placed two cups of tea and a plate with cream puffs
        <p></p>on it.
        <p></p>She set the cream puffs in front of Itsuki, so she was probably planning
        <p></p>to eat hers when Amane was there.
        <p></p>After serving Itsuki's tea with elegant movements, Mahiru seemed
        <p></p>unsure of where to sit. Her gaze wandered around the room for a little bit,
        <p></p>then she took a seat next to Itsuki, leaving a proper distance between them.
        <p></p>He was somewhat relieved, since it would have been unforgivable to let
        <p></p>a girl sit on the floor, even on top of a rug, while he was sitting on the sofa.
        <p></p>He smirked at the fact that she was sitting at the very edge, probably
        <p></p>because she wasn't used to his presence.
        <p></p>Well, I guess that's fair. I don't know Miss Shiina well enough for us to
        <p></p>be on good or bad terms with each other.
        <p></p>Itsuki and Mahiru weren't especially close.
        <p></p>From Itsuki's perspective, she was his girlfriend's friend, and the girl his
        <p></p>best friend loved, and he probably knew her better than most other people,
        <p></p>but he hadn't been in close contact with her like Chitose or Amane.
        <p></p>Until now, they had hardly ever been alone together like this, so he felt
        <p></p>unspeakably awkward.
        <p></p>He glanced over at her and saw her sipping her tea with a composed
        <p></p>expression. He knew she was probably feeling awkward as well, but she
        <p></p>didn't show it.
        <p></p>"Sorry for taking advantage of your hospitality, after showing up so
        <p></p>suddenly."
        <p></p>"No, like you said earlier, it's Amane's fault for remembering those
        <p></p>things he had to do at the last minute. I think he'll be back soon, but sorry
        <p></p>for making you wait."
        <p></p>Mahiru bobbed her head, and Itsuki chuckled in spite of himself.
        <p></p>He knew that she probably wasn't aware of it herself and that she didn't
        <p></p>mean to give this impression, but her actions and words were just like those
        <p></p>of a wife apologizing for her husband's absence. She must have spent so
        <p></p>much time by Amane's side that they came naturally to her.
        <p></p>"You don't need to worry about me; I did only tell him I was coming
        <p></p>today, after all. At any rate…you really are over at Amane's place, huh?"
        <p></p>Itsuki commented quietly.
        <p></p>Mahiru flinched slightly, and then her cheeks flushed a faint crimson,
        <p></p>and she drew her shoulders in.
        <p></p>"Um… I suppose you're wondering who I think I am. I must seem like
        <p></p>I'm forcing things…"
        <p></p>"I wasn't trying to criticize you. I just think it's nice that the two of you
        <p></p>have gotten to the point where it's normal. It's very charming."
        <p></p>He got the sense that both Amane and Mahiru felt like it was natural to
        <p></p>be together, and as someone who was watching their romance develop, he
        <p></p>thought that it was sweet.
        <p></p>There had been no major developments after several months of these
        <p></p>two high schoolers spending time alone together, but now he could glimpse
        <p></p>an opening in their caution and trepidation, which was all the more
        <p></p>charming. Though he did feel that the reason why they hadn't progressed
        <p></p>was mainly because Amane hadn't pushed for it.
        <p></p>"Amane has really mellowed out since he started spending time with
        <p></p>you, and I think that must be thanks to your influence."
        <p></p>"I-is that so? That's wonderful."
        <p></p>"I mean, when you met, Amane was cold and kind of a downer;
        <p></p>honestly, he was pretty unfriendly. He seemed really distant and gloomy, so
        <p></p>I think it's a mark of progress that he's expressing his feelings more and
        <p></p>showing people his mellow smile."
        <p></p>When Itsuki thought about the fact that it had been Mahiru who brought
        <p></p>that out in Amane, instead of him, he felt a lump of discomfort form in his
        <p></p>chest. But it soon disappeared when he reminded himself that as long as
        <p></p>Amane was happy, that was what mattered. Itsuki earnestly felt that the
        <p></p>change had done his friend good.
        <p></p>Mahiru, who had been listening quietly, glanced up at him with a serious
        <p></p>look in her eyes.
        <p></p>"…Can I ask you something that I've been curious about?"
        <p></p>"As long as it's something I can answer, ask away."
        <p></p>"…Well, I've been wondering how you and Amane came to be friends,"
        <p></p>she said falteringly, after some hesitation.
        <p></p>Itsuki responded with a gentle smile.
        <p></p>"You're curious?"
        <p></p>"…Well, yes, I am. I feel like Amane is the type who is very wary of
        <p></p>others, so I was thinking that there might have been some impetus that
        <p></p>brought you together."
        <p></p>"Is this because you want to know everything about the guy you like?"
        <p></p>"…I mean, if I thought that asking would make Amane uncomfortable, I
        <p></p>would refrain, but…before, when I asked him, he told me that you were
        <p></p>already friends before he realized it, so I was curious. Because Amane
        <p></p>himself said he didn't know why you became friends with him."
        <p></p>"Ah, I guess that means Amane doesn't remember. Actually, I think it's
        <p></p>more like he doesn't realize that he knows."
        <p></p>When Itsuki had spoken to Amane at the start of school, he seemed to
        <p></p>have completely forgotten about the past, so Amane probably had no idea
        <p></p>why Itsuki had wanted to be his friend.
        <p></p>So that was why he didn't have a clue what had kicked off their
        <p></p>friendship.
        <p></p>Mahiru stared at Itsuki inquisitively as he pondered how to explain
        <p></p>things to her. He started by asking her a question.
        <p></p>"Say, Miss Shiina, if I put on glasses and made a gloomy face, would
        <p></p>you recognize me? Suppose you saw me several months after talking to me
        <p></p>only once, and only just a little."
        <p></p>"…Well, that would depend on the situation."
        <p></p>"Ah-ha-ha! That's because I bet you are very observant when it comes
        <p></p>to other people. Amane didn't recognize me, you see, because I also had a
        <p></p>much tamer haircut and everything than I do now."
        <p></p>They say it's easy to judge a person by their outward appearance, and
        <p></p>Itsuki agreed with that. He thought that when he really looked at someone,
        <p></p>he noticed their physical features, of course. But their style and the way
        <p></p>they wore their hair also made a strong impression.
        <p></p>If a girl he knew quite well suddenly cut her hair very short, it would
        <p></p>naturally take him a moment to recognize her. When the impression
        <p></p>someone gives changes entirely, it takes time for everyone's brains to sync
        <p></p>them with the person that they know.
        <p></p>So he figured that if a person he met only once and only for a short time
        <p></p>completely changed their look, he couldn't help but think of them as a
        <p></p>different person.
        <p></p>"Before we started high school, we had that school tour trip, remember?
        <p></p>That's where Amane and me first met."
        <p></p>The reason that Itsuki felt both nostalgia and anxiety when he thought
        <p></p>back on that time was because he had been going through some emotional
        <p></p>turmoil back then. Thinking about it dredged up some difficult memories.
        <p></p>All the more so because it was a friction that had still not been resolved.
        <p></p>"Back then, see, I was in a bad way. I was constantly fighting with my
        <p></p>dad about Chi, and he had all sorts of things to say about my lineage and
        <p></p>my future, so I was really stressed out. He was telling me not to go to
        <p></p>school here, but to attend a prep school that had stricter regulations, and
        <p></p>other stuff like that."
        <p></p>Even Itsuki could understand his father's feelings on the subject.
        <p></p>Dating Chitose had already caused one rift in their relationship. Itsuki
        <p></p>knew that his father didn't want to fight about anything else and that he was
        <p></p>trying to keep ahold of his son.
        <p></p>If pushed to say, Itsuki would admit that his father cared about him, but
        <p></p>that care had always been colored by a strong desire to see his son follow
        <p></p>his ideals.
        <p></p>His father had tried to be a good parent, and so he had been very strict
        <p></p>with Itsuki. He wanted Itsuki to be an upright, moral person and to make
        <p></p>the family proud.
        <p></p>Itsuki could understand his father's feelings. But spending so long trying
        <p></p>to live up to his parents' expectations had inevitably made Itsuki depressed.
        <p></p>And Mother was off on her own, either at her studio or getting ready for
        <p></p>some exhibition, so she was busy and didn't have much to do with me.
        <p></p>Itsuki understood that his father had carefully raised him to recognize
        <p></p>that his mother had a job of her own and that she was very good at it. He
        <p></p>was grateful for the fact that he had been raised with a proper appreciation
        <p></p>of the work that went into running a household.
        <p></p>Even still, he had been in middle school when his pent-up frustrations
        <p></p>had exploded, and he had yelled at his father that he was not some kind of
        <p></p>remote-controlled toy.
        <p></p>"My head always hurt, and I was really unsteady on my feet. Then, at a
        <p></p>moment like that, I had to go on the trip alone, on a different schedule from
        <p></p>Chi and Yuuta."
        <p></p>Seeking a period of time away from his parents, Itsuki had applied for a
        <p></p>multiday observation tour of his future high school. But his schedule hadn't
        <p></p>matched up with his friends', Chitose and Yuuta, so he had ended up
        <p></p>participating alone.
        <p></p>That had not gone well.
        <p></p>"Well, somehow I joined the tour without letting anything show, but
        <p></p>halfway through the day, things got tough, and I crouched down and said
        <p></p>'Toilet' with no further explanation. Then Amane ran after me and helped
        <p></p>take care of me."
        <p></p>Middle schooler Itsuki had slipped away from the group, saying he was
        <p></p>going to the bathroom alone. He had looked awfully unwell, so Amane had
        <p></p>followed him despite not even knowing the other boy's name. He must have
        <p></p>been quite the busybody.
        <p></p>"…Are you sick?
        <p></p>"You don't seem to have a fever… Wait here a minute. I'll go buy you
        <p></p>something to drink. I saw a vending machine while we were walking
        <p></p>around.
        <p></p>"Here. Is water okay? Do you have medicine?
        <p></p>"If you're not well, you should leave early and go home, or go to one of
        <p></p>the high school teachers and get them to let you rest in the health room for
        <p></p>a while. You might collapse if you continue the tour in this condition.
        <p></p>"I'm gonna go get a teacher, you wait there."
        <p></p>Itsuki was grateful to Amane, who was so worried that he looked after
        <p></p>Itsuki, even knowing that the faculty would get angry at him for wandering
        <p></p>around the school without permission. Later, Itsuki felt guilty for getting
        <p></p>Amane in trouble.
        <p></p>Itsuki had waited for him to come back so that he could apologize, but a
        <p></p>teacher had shown up instead and told him that "Amane was allowed to go
        <p></p>back to the information session."
        <p></p>After that, Itsuki was allowed to rest in the health room for a while, and
        <p></p>ultimately the school tour ended without him seeing Amane again or getting
        <p></p>the chance to thank him.
        <p></p>"And, well, that's about the whole story. I guess he didn't even
        <p></p>remember it; he didn't seem to think he was doing anything major. Even so,
        <p></p>I'm still grateful to him."
        <p></p>Itsuki had calmly left the tour, trying his best not to let anything show on
        <p></p>his face, so he didn't think anyone had noticed his distress.
        <p></p>He had never imagined that Amane would follow him, a complete
        <p></p>stranger, down the stairs.
        <p></p>"We started high school, and my appearance was all different, but
        <p></p>Amane hadn't changed a bit. We happened to be in the same class, and I
        <p></p>went up to talk to him, but he really didn't remember me at all! That made
        <p></p>me laugh."
        <p></p>He couldn't really blame Amane for that.
        <p></p>Itsuki's appearance had gotten much more cheerful after he entered high
        <p></p>school.
        <p></p>His behavior was more easygoing, and he was trying to break free of the
        <p></p>honor student mold that his father wanted him to fit.
        <p></p>Once he was feeling more like himself, he could see that striving to be
        <p></p>an honor student had been stifling and painful. He was grateful that he had
        <p></p>broken out of his cage with Chitose before he suffocated.
        <p></p>He felt some regret that he had ever fettered the free bird inside of him.
        <p></p>"Well, he was the only one who was concerned about me, and I knew
        <p></p>that he was a good guy, so I hung around with him, and one way or another,
        <p></p>we wound up being friends… I guess that about sums it up."
        <p></p>"…Amane is a pretty empathetic person."
        <p></p>"I agree… That's why, you see, I've been sort of vigilant when it comes
        <p></p>to you."
        <p></p>"…To make sure I'm not tricking or manipulating or hurting the
        <p></p>kindhearted Amane, you mean?"
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to immediately understand what Itsuki was trying to say.
        <p></p>She didn't seem surprised, she just stared at him with calm eyes.
        <p></p>Glad that the matter was settled quickly, Itsuki smiled, deliberately not
        <p></p>answering her question, then shrugged a little.
        <p></p>"Well, normally, I think people would be worried about you instead, but
        <p></p>from where I'm standing, I was more worried about my oftenmisunderstood friend than about a popular person I hardly knew."
        <p></p>To Itsuki, up until the day of their Christmas Eve party, he had seen the
        <p></p>person known as Mahiru Shiina as a flawless superwoman, a graceful
        <p></p>beauty beyond reproach.
        <p></p>Nothing more, and nothing less.
        <p></p>In other words, to Itsuki, who had never had anything to do with her,
        <p></p>Mahiru's personality was an unknown factor, and she was a stranger who
        <p></p>wielded a lot of influence.
        <p></p>What if, behind that beautiful smile, she was playing some sort of cruel
        <p></p>game?
        <p></p>Itsuki, who had been tormented by malicious rumors before, was
        <p></p>skeptical of any hearsay that spread among the student body.
        <p></p>Even Mahiru, who seemed to be such a beautiful and virtuous person
        <p></p>that people called her an angel, was just someone else to be suspicious of.
        <p></p>The revelation of his mistrust did not seem to upset Mahiru.
        <p></p>"…I think that was a sensible conclusion to reach. Honestly, if I had
        <p></p>been a friend in Amane's corner, I probably also would have thought it was
        <p></p>a little suspicious and wondered if I had some kind of ulterior motive."
        <p></p>"I mean, if you think about it, it's hard to imagine what you would gain
        <p></p>by associating with Amane, you know? If anything, I would think it would
        <p></p>be more trouble than it was worth. So I just had to determine whether you
        <p></p>were looking to get anything out of talking to him."
        <p></p>"As well you should have."
        <p></p>"Anyway, it didn't take long for me to find out that you were just some
        <p></p>girl who liked Amane, so now I don't have any worries about that, and
        <p></p>actually, I'm hoping that you might spur him on."
        <p></p>At this stage, Itsuki knew that Mahiru was just a girl who appreciated
        <p></p>Amane's personality and had fallen in love with him, so there was nothing
        <p></p>for him to worry about.
        <p></p>Instead, he was worried about Mahiru—worried she might be getting
        <p></p>impatient because Amane was such a good-for-nothing.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked embarrassed when he said that she was a girl who liked
        <p></p>Amane. She pressed her lips together and hugged a pillow, so even as he
        <p></p>smiled modestly, thinking he had teased her too much, Itsuki resolved to go
        <p></p>ahead and tell her all sorts of things while Amane wasn't around.
        <p></p>"It's like this: Amane's an extreme pushover. And he's ridiculously
        <p></p>vulnerable to pressure from you, Miss Shiina, so you should just go for it;
        <p></p>don't hesitate."
        <p></p>"Y-you say that, but…I'm already trying my best on a daily basis."
        <p></p>"Mm, I believe I can see that even as a third party, but, well… So listen,
        <p></p>Amane's…how do I put this, he's a huge wuss, the type of person who can't
        <p></p>really accept affection from other people."
        <p></p>"…He sure is," Mahiru agreed with a somewhat faraway look.
        <p></p>Itsuki hoped that was a good sign.
        <p></p>"Must be difficult."
        <p></p>"Eh-heh. But even these hardships are part of the pleasure of love, no?"
        <p></p>"I guess you're right. I suffered too when I was young, and you know,
        <p></p>now…I wouldn't say it was a good thing, but it's something I can look back
        <p></p>and laugh about."
        <p></p>It was less of a laugh and more of a bitter smile, but even so, Itsuki and
        <p></p>Chitose had made it through those days together, and he wouldn't throw
        <p></p>away those memories. He had them tucked deep in his heart as nostalgic
        <p></p>reminiscences.
        <p></p>He was waiting for Mahiru to laugh and tell him he was still young, but
        <p></p>she seemed sort of unsure how to answer and put on a vague smile.
        <p></p>From her complicated response, he guessed that she might have heard
        <p></p>something from Chitose.
        <p></p>"You heard from Chi?"
        <p></p>When Itsuki dropped his smile and quietly asked the question, Mahiru
        <p></p>nodded.
        <p></p>"…Just a little," she replied, also quietly. "About Chitose quitting the
        <p></p>track club and how you started dating."
        <p></p>"Is that so? Well, what'd you think of me?"
        <p></p>What does she think about me confessing directly to Chitose's face
        <p></p>without understanding the situation I was creating and how as a result
        <p></p>Chitose was harassed by an upperclassman in her club?
        <p></p>Strictly speaking, the envy that the other girl had toward Chitose had
        <p></p>just flared up because of Itsuki's confession of love, but even so, he had
        <p></p>been the one who added fuel to the fire.
        <p></p>If only he had played his cards a little better, maybe Chitose could have
        <p></p>dated Itsuki without getting attacked by the upperclassman, and she could
        <p></p>have continued to be part of the track club. If that had happened, the coach
        <p></p>might have written her a recommendation to get her into a high school with
        <p></p>a strong track team. Her whole life path would have been different.
        <p></p>"…It's not my place to say anything. If I take one wrong step, I'll wind
        <p></p>up bearing the same regrets as you do."
        <p></p>"You don't have to worry about that. You're many times more careful
        <p></p>than I am, and you know how to play your cards well."
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed better able to pick up on things like that and more
        <p></p>proficient at laying the groundwork—as she was slowly, bit by bit, closing
        <p></p>the distance between her and Amane at school—so that she didn't upset
        <p></p>anyone.
        <p></p>If Itsuki had been considerate like her, Chitose might not have been
        <p></p>injured, and Yuuta, who had witnessed the whole ordeal, might not have
        <p></p>become so cautious around girls.
        <p></p>It was too late for all that; there was no way to change it.
        <p></p>"But know that I'll probably hate you if this situation ends up hurting
        <p></p>Amane deeply. Though I know I don't have room to talk, as the person who
        <p></p>ruined Chi's future opportunities."
        <p></p>"In that case, I would expect to be hated. No one would be happy if their
        <p></p>dear friend got hurt… I would hate you, too, if you ever did something that
        <p></p>caused Amane or Chitose pain."
        <p></p>"Ha-ha, glad to hear it… I guess there would be no avoiding it."
        <p></p>He was relieved to hear that she would hate him for that, probably
        <p></p>because he'd had so many friends who'd tried to make excuses for his
        <p></p>actions.
        <p></p>The people around him had told him that the incident he had caused was
        <p></p>not his fault, that he wasn't to blame—they'd been kind, but he had always
        <p></p>regretted his actions. He had always secretly worried about whether he was
        <p></p>really at fault and whether Chitose actually resented him for it on some
        <p></p>level.
        <p></p>So he was delighted to have someone who would directly put those
        <p></p>worries to bed, even though the hypotheticals still plagued his mind.
        <p></p>And he thought it was great to have someone around who would tell him
        <p></p>off properly, someone who had Chitose's and Amane's best interests in
        <p></p>mind.
        <p></p>"…I know this is forward of me, and it's only my personal opinion, but
        <p></p>Chitose chooses to be with you, and I don't think she has any regrets. She's
        <p></p>always talking about you, and she seems so happy… Wouldn't it be best to
        <p></p>sit down and talk about it together?"
        <p></p>Itsuki was wearing a bitter smile. Mahiru gave him a gentle look and
        <p></p>murmured, "Occasionally, the two of you both hold back from each other,
        <p></p>you know?"
        <p></p>Her words made him feel strangely warm and kind of embarrassed. Still,
        <p></p>his stiff expression softened.
        <p></p>"…Thank goodness that the two of them have you for a friend, Miss
        <p></p>Shiina," Itsuki mumbled, feeling keenly that Amane had good judgment
        <p></p>when it came to people.
        <p></p>Mahiru heard what he said and blinked several times in surprise.
        <p></p>"Sorry, sorry, it must bother you when I call you his friend, since you're
        <p></p>actually Amane's future girlfriend."
        <p></p>"Th-that's not what I meant!"
        <p></p>Mahiru glared at him as if to chide him for even saying such a thing. Her
        <p></p>eyes filled up with tears of embarrassment, and her face turned bright red.
        <p></p>Itsuki heedlessly burst into laughter.
        <p></p>He wondered why Amane didn't try a little harder to push things along,
        <p></p>especially when it was so easy to tell how Mahiru felt. Amane liked her
        <p></p>enough that the people around him noticed it, so if he just pushed a little
        <p></p>more…
        <p></p>Even so, the way things are now is just what I would expect from the two
        <p></p>of them, so it's probably just right.
        <p></p>As Itsuki was musing that his friend still had quite a ways to go on the
        <p></p>pathway to love, the sound of a key turning in a lock came from the
        <p></p>entryway.
        <p></p>Speak of the devil, and he appears.
        <p></p>Maybe because she couldn't bear to sit there any longer, Mahiru
        <p></p>immediately stood up and trotted to the front door, as if to escape from
        <p></p>Itsuki.
        <p></p>"I'm back. Did Itsuki show up?"
        <p></p>"Welcome home. He's been here quite a while already."
        <p></p>Their voices got closer as they moved in from the entryway. Amane
        <p></p>appeared, holding a paper bag from a stationery store where he had
        <p></p>apparently stopped off along the way, and frowned apologetically.
        <p></p>"Crap…sorry, Itsuki."
        <p></p>"It's fine, it's fine, I was able to have a nice leisurely conversation with
        <p></p>Miss Shiina. Ain't that right, Miss Shiina?"
        <p></p>"Eh-he-he, that's right."
        <p></p>We never could have had that kind of conversation with Amane around.
        <p></p>Thinking about it that way, Amane's sudden errands weren't a bad thing.
        <p></p>"…What did you talk about?"
        <p></p>"Oh, are you jealous, mister?"
        <p></p>"Idiot, as if."
        <p></p>Amane answered with a little irritation in his voice, and Mahiru frowned
        <p></p>ever so slightly, but Itsuki was probably the only one who noticed.
        <p></p>I bet Miss Shiina would be happy if he honestly admitted he was jealous.
        <p></p>Itsuki realized that it was unreasonable to expect any more, knowing as
        <p></p>he did that Amane was bashful and never up-front about his feelings, but he
        <p></p>always got irritated watching his friend, who seemed unable to take even a
        <p></p>single step forward.
        <p></p>"…Seriously, what did you talk about?"
        <p></p>"Now, what was it? That's our secret."
        <p></p>Either because of Amane's reaction or because he had never planned to
        <p></p>tell him from the start, Itsuki declared their conversation a secret in a lively,
        <p></p>somewhat mischievous voice, placing his index finger against his mouth.
        <p></p>His expression made Amane look all the more suspicious, but Mahiru
        <p></p>deliberately pretended not to know anything.
        <p></p>"Oh-ho, don't get sulky, please… Let's just say it was interesting stories
        <p></p>about you. How's that?" she said.
        <p></p>"That's a total lie, and even if it wasn't, Itsuki's the last guy I want
        <p></p>telling you stories!"
        <p></p>"I wonder… Oh, and Akazawa brought us some cream puffs."
        <p></p>"…I won't let you dodge the question."
        <p></p>"You don't want any cream puffs?"
        <p></p>"Of course I do!"
        <p></p>Amane seemed hungry for cream puffs. He fixed Mahiru with a stare,
        <p></p>but she maintained her beautiful smile the whole time as she gave Amane a
        <p></p>little shove and sent him off toward the sink.
        <p></p>"If you want to eat cream puffs, then hurry up and go wash your hands,
        <p></p>please."
        <p></p>"…I'll get you to tell me later."
        <p></p>"You can go right ahead and try. Now, would you rather have coffee or
        <p></p>tea?"
        <p></p>"…Coffee, please."
        <p></p>"Got it. Okay, off you go."
        <p></p>Itsuki met Mahiru's eyes after she deftly chased Amane off to the sink
        <p></p>with a beaming bright smile.
        <p></p>"…You two are meant each other, for real," he mumbled in spite of
        <p></p>himself.
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes went wide, as if she had only just remembered that he
        <p></p>was there, then she visibly withdrew and pleaded quietly, "Please forget that
        <p></p>you saw that."
        <p></p>Wearing his biggest smile yet that day, Itsuki shrugged.
        <hr class="half"/>
        <p></p>Chapter 84: That Voice Is Against the Rules 
        <p></p>Mahiru had fallen in love with a guy who was cautious, shy, and meek.
        <p></p>She couldn't say he was all that friendly, and he did adopt a curt attitude
        <p></p>toward unfamiliar people, but he wasn't exactly what she would call cold.
        <p></p>He could be considerate, and his disposition was naturally gentle.
        <p></p>Once he got to know someone, he listened to them with a calm
        <p></p>expression on his face and showed them his soft smile.
        <p></p>Once someone formed a deep friendship with him, it became clear that
        <p></p>although he was not very good at making conversation, he was considerate
        <p></p>and very thoughtful, a gentlemanly sort of person.
        <p></p>…Too gentlemanly. Whenever Mahiru physically closed the distance
        <p></p>between them, he opened it back up, and before she could get his attention,
        <p></p>he moved away. It was causing Mahiru some consternation.
        <p></p>What can I do to get Amane to be more aware of me?
        <p></p>Before she could get him to love her, she had to get him to see her, but
        <p></p>she wasn't sure how to do that.
        <p></p>The easiest and quickest way would probably be to wear something
        <p></p>revealing to seize his attention, but common sense and propriety convinced
        <p></p>her she would immediately be rejected if she tried something like that.
        <p></p>Recklessly exposing so much skin was naturally something Mahiru had
        <p></p>never done, and she knew that Amane wouldn't even be able to look her in
        <p></p>the eye if she was dressed like that. Plus, if things went poorly, it might
        <p></p>even ruin his image of her.
        <p></p>She'd considered trying to be clingier, but she was certain that would
        <p></p>only make Amane pull away from her.
        <p></p>He didn't mind if their hands or shoulders touched a little bit. But the
        <p></p>moment their bodies came in contact, he always casually put space between
        <p></p>them or informed her in an uneasy voice, "You're touching me."
        <p></p>Mahiru also thought that an approach like that was too pushy and was
        <p></p>vulgar to boot. She got embarrassed just thinking about it and rejected the
        <p></p>idea in the end.
        <p></p>So how can I get his attention?
        <p></p>"What about creeping into his room at night?"
        <p></p>"Have you been listening? I can't just barge into a guy's bedroom and
        <p></p>attack him while he's asleep. Not only is it bad manners, it's trespassing!"
        <p></p>Mahiru had given Chitose the basics and asked for her advice. When she
        <p></p>got that unthinkable response, Mahiru narrowed her eyes and glared at her
        <p></p>friend in spite of herself.
        <p></p>She did feel bad about taking up Chitose's time after school to ask her
        <p></p>about all this. But Chitose's advice was much too forward. There was no
        <p></p>way Mahiru could do something like that.
        <p></p>Chitose didn't seem intimidated by Mahiru's chilly gaze. She stirred the
        <p></p>café au lait she had ordered with a stirring stick and laughed quietly.
        <p></p>"Come on, you know I was joking. But listen, I've said it before: With
        <p></p>that type of guy, I think it's going to be hard to develop the kind of
        <p></p>relationship you're after unless you really push things along."
        <p></p>"Th-that's—"
        <p></p>"I mean, he hasn't done a thing, has he? Despite having such a
        <p></p>charming, cute girl by his side, diligently looking after him and treating him
        <p></p>with so much care and affection. Like, is he even a man? Is his thing
        <p></p>attached right? Is it working? Makes me wonder…"
        <p></p>"I'll thank you to refrain from such talk. Geez."
        <p></p>Even though Mahiru knew that there weren't any other students from
        <p></p>their school in the café, since she had checked to see if there were any
        <p></p>people in the nearby seats, remarks like that could be quite risky.
        <p></p>Even if she turned down the volume, the things Chitose was saying
        <p></p>would have been really awful for someone to overhear. That put Mahiru on
        <p></p>edge and made her feel embarrassed.
        <p></p>For better or for worse, Chitose had an unreserved quality to her, and
        <p></p>when it was just the two girls, she often made very lively remarks without
        <p></p>any reservation. Mahiru often had to work hard not to give her disapproving
        <p></p>looks.
        <p></p>Mahiru's cheeks flushed when Chitose mentioned a particular thing that
        <p></p>she rarely thought about, and Chitose looked even more amused.
        <p></p>…She's right, though: Amane has never once behaved that way toward
        <p></p>me.
        <p></p>Even when they were alone together in private, he hadn't made any such
        <p></p>moves.
        <p></p>Mahiru had assumed that he was just being careful, but she wondered if
        <p></p>that was really the case. She tried hard to put the uninvited thought out of
        <p></p>her mind.
        <p></p>Mahiru softly cleared her throat. She attempted to pull herself together,
        <p></p>but even so, once the thought had crossed her mind, she couldn't let it go.
        <p></p>"But really, Amane's not very eager. If anything, he's too gentlemanly,
        <p></p>right? He's the kinda guy who'll stay a respectful distance. Normally, I'd
        <p></p>say it wouldn't surprise me if he had some sort of ulterior motive. That's
        <p></p>why I've got my doubts about him being a real man."
        <p></p>"Chitose…"
        <p></p>"Geez, sorry. Look, the one thing I wanna say is that since he's so
        <p></p>rational, since he's the type not to act on any feelings he might have, if you
        <p></p>keep doing what you're doing, you're never going to get closer to him,
        <p></p>okay? If you want him to notice you, you've got to be the one to make it
        <p></p>happen."
        <p></p>Mahiru knew that perfectly well already. But she didn't know what she
        <p></p>was supposed to do. She had already tried everything she could think of.
        <p></p>"…Well, you're you, and you're having an effect on Amane without him
        <p></p>even knowing, I'm sure. He just hasn't noticed yet. And Amane's a disaster.
        <p></p>I don't know how you put up with him," Chitose muttered in a low voice.
        <p></p>"What is it that I've done?"
        <p></p>Mahiru probed her gently for the meaning of her statements.
        <p></p>"Been so darn cute!"
        <p></p>Chitose didn't seem inclined to explain any further and laughed as she
        <p></p>evaded the question.
        <p></p>Mahiru knew that when she got like this, Chitose would stubbornly
        <p></p>refuse to talk, so Mahiru quickly gave up on getting any more information
        <p></p>out of her and sighed softly.
        <p></p>…So then what should I do?
        <p></p>She had seen for herself that Amane wasn't completely indifferent to
        <p></p>her.
        <p></p>She got to see the kind, sweet expressions that he never showed to
        <p></p>anyone else, and she knew that he was always courteous and honorable
        <p></p>toward her.
        <p></p>She also knew that he thought she was something special, more than
        <p></p>anyone else did.
        <p></p>At the very least, he liked her as a person, and it was a bit of wishful
        <p></p>thinking on Mahiru's part, but she thought that he liked her as a member of
        <p></p>the opposite sex as well.
        <p></p>If not, he probably wouldn't have opened up to her, and surely he
        <p></p>wouldn't be spoiling Mahiru and letting her spoil him.
        <p></p>"How do I put this…? Mahiru, you and Amane are both cruel people in
        <p></p>your own ways. Anyway, I think you should keep trying and really pour on
        <p></p>the pressure."
        <p></p>"Pressure… So for example, Chitose, um, when you're with Akazawa,
        <p></p>how do you spend your time together?"
        <p></p>"Huh? I don't think knowing that will help you."
        <p></p>If Chitose was going to be that forward, then Mahiru wanted to hear
        <p></p>how she spent time with her boyfriend, as an example. But Chitose waved
        <p></p>her hand a few times with a loose smile on her face.
        <p></p>"With Ikkun, you know, we make out and stuff."
        <p></p>"M-make out…"
        <p></p>"When we get some time together, well, we either go out or we have a
        <p></p>stay-at-home date. But in your case, you're limited to staying at home, I
        <p></p>guess. Hmm, when we're at home, we do stuff like snuggle up and watch a
        <p></p>DVD, or read comics, or play a game, or have rambling conversations. You
        <p></p>know, that sort of thing. And also, if no one else is in the house, we, well,
        <p></p>you know?"
        <p></p>"G-got it, okay! You don't need to give me all the details!"
        <p></p>"What? I haven't even really said what it is we do yet…but what were
        <p></p>you imagining, I wonder?"
        <p></p>"..."
        <p></p>"Sorry, sorry. Well, we cuddle and kiss, and all sorts of things on top of
        <p></p>that, but there's no way you can do that, right, Mahiru? Of course, if you
        <p></p>did, I would applaud your courage!"
        <p></p>"I—I won't! I can't!"
        <p></p>If they even tried to kiss, they wouldn't be able to so much as look each
        <p></p>other in the eye. After all, kissing, and everything that came after it, was
        <p></p>usually something people did once they were already dating, not a method
        <p></p>for catching someone's attention.
        <p></p>Mahiru glared daggers at Chitose, wondering how she could even
        <p></p>suggest such a thing, but Chitose brushed it off with a smile, completely
        <p></p>unbothered.
        <p></p>"Right, that's why my experience won't be of any use to you. The
        <p></p>wholesome kind of appeal that you want to make is best done with the
        <p></p>things you're already always doing, you see?"
        <p></p>"…Huh?"
        <p></p>"Boys get excited if you so much as smile at them, and you're already so
        <p></p>close to Amane, I bet you touch a lot. You're holding hands like it's
        <p></p>nothing, and you sit next to each other to read books together or play
        <p></p>games, so you're already making your move."
        <p></p>"Th-that's—"
        <p></p>"And you eat dinner together almost every day, and smile at each other
        <p></p>while you talk, and spend time snuggled up together like it's the most
        <p></p>natural thing in the world, so I'd say your efforts to attract him have already
        <p></p>been quite… Well, from the sidelines, you already look like a pair of
        <p></p>newlyweds. You're close enough to make people wonder."
        <p></p>Chitose grinned as she watched Mahiru's reaction, and Mahiru opened
        <p></p>and closed her mouth wordlessly several times, her bottom lip trembling.
        <p></p>She tried to object, but what emerged from the back of her throat was
        <p></p>just a soft groan that did not amount to any words.
        <p></p>…Newlyweds, she said?
        <p></p>Mahiru had certainly not been thinking about that when she spent time
        <p></p>with Amane. She had been sure that the two of them had a normal
        <p></p>relationship.
        <p></p>Helping to look after someone was in Mahiru's nature, and she sat
        <p></p>beside Amane because the sofa was the only place to sit. She was at his
        <p></p>place until later in the evening because they were finishing their homework
        <p></p>together or having lively conversations. Of course, the strongest reason for
        <p></p>her to spend time with Amane was that she wanted to be close to him. But
        <p></p>now she was being forced to think about how their conduct must look to
        <p></p>anyone else. A groan escaped her lips.
        <p></p>"You're telling me it was unintentional?" Chitose asked. "Well, all the
        <p></p>people who already know that you two are hanging out together probably
        <p></p>figured as much, so it's fine, don't worry."
        <p></p>"That's not fine at all!"
        <p></p>"Mahiru, you're shouting."
        <p></p>Chitose was laughing, her eyes squinted up as if to rebuke Mahiru for
        <p></p>raising her voice in response to the uncalled-for additional information.
        <p></p>Mahiru glared at her a little, feeling regret that she had forgotten herself for
        <p></p>a second.
        <p></p>Chitose gave her a satisfied smile and reassured her, "Relax, all we can
        <p></p>tell from the sidelines is that you have good chemistry." From the
        <p></p>encouraging way she said it, Mahiru couldn't tell whether she should or
        <p></p>shouldn't relax.
        <p></p>"Anyway, the two of you get along so well you give newlyweds and
        <p></p>longtime couples a run for their money. But at this point, I wonder if maybe
        <p></p>you should consider giving indirect contact a try?"
        <p></p>"…Indirect?"
        <p></p>"You've tried everything that's socially acceptable, but you still want
        <p></p>Amane to notice you, right? So you gotta change up your strategy. People
        <p></p>can get used to anything if you do it enough. Normally, you smile at him
        <p></p>and snuggle up to him, and you're already plying him with food, right? So
        <p></p>next time, try attacking with your voice, I think."
        <p></p>"…My voice?"
        <p></p>"That's right. Why don't you call him right before bed? A good-night
        <p></p>call isn't just for chitchat. He doesn't usually hear your voice at bedtime,
        <p></p>and it's like you're slipping into his private space, so it'll set his heart
        <p></p>thumping. It'll feel all the more exciting because you're not there in front of
        <p></p>him."
        <p></p>Chitose assured her that it worked even for people who were already
        <p></p>dating, turning her gaze slightly upward with a bashful look as if she was
        <p></p>remembering something. Even to another girl, she looked extraordinarily
        <p></p>cute.
        <p></p>…She's right, I almost never call him, so it will probably be a new
        <p></p>experience.
        <p></p>Usually, Amane was right beside her when she wanted to talk to him, so
        <p></p>they heard each other directly. Sometimes, they corresponded through
        <p></p>notes. But phone calls were a method of communication that had naturally
        <p></p>fallen out of use for them, so there could be something novel in the
        <p></p>experience.
        <p></p>Besides, being able to hear Amane's voice right before sleeping had its
        <p></p>own appeal for Mahiru. If it meant that she could hear her beloved's voice
        <p></p>and go to bed feeling content, then she had to give it a try.
        <p></p>"…In that case, um, I-I'll try my best," Mahiru said timidly.
        <p></p>Chitose made a delighted gasp, and her eyes lit up.
        <p></p>"So before bed, I'll try talking to him. We'll talk about our day, and
        <p></p>anything fun that happened, and our plans for the next day… Sharing a
        <p></p>conversation will be good, I think."
        <p></p>"…That sounds so like you, Mahiru."
        <p></p>Mahiru announced her decision with grave earnestness, but Chitose's
        <p></p>smile transformed into something softer.
        <p></p>"Why do you look so pleased?"
        <p></p>"Because you're so adorable."
        <p></p>"You're making fun of me, aren't you?"
        <p></p>"No way, no how!"
        <p></p>"Good grief."
        <p></p>Chitose gave a sarcastic response, and Mahiru shot her a reproachful
        <p></p>look, but Chitose smiled and murmured quietly, "So cute," as if she were
        <p></p>watching a child.
        <p></p>That made Mahiru very uncomfortable. All she wanted to do was to get
        <p></p>Chitose to stop looking at her like that.
        <p></p>"Man, you're really cute! Girls in love are always cute, you know. And
        <p></p>you're even more adorable because of how devoted and pure you are."
        <p></p>"…So you're saying you find my feelings amusing?"
        <p></p>"You're imagining things. It's just your imagination."
        <p></p>Chitose was grinning even as she told Mahiru she was imagining things,
        <p></p>so Mahiru pouted a little and then turned away in a huff.
        <p></p>After that, Mahiru parted from Chitose and went back to her apartment.
        <p></p>Then, after changing clothes, she headed over to Amane's place, feeling
        <p></p>enthusiastic about trying out a good-night phone call.
        <p></p>She used her spare key, as was now the norm for her, and passed through
        <p></p>the entryway. Amane popped out suddenly from the kitchen, evidently
        <p></p>alerted to her presence by the sound of the door unlocking, and said,
        <p></p>"Welcome home."
        <p></p>She had told Amane ahead of time that she was going to be a little late
        <p></p>and had asked him to cook the rice, so there was nothing strange about it,
        <p></p>but in spite of herself, Mahiru froze when she saw him in his apron.
        <p></p>Amane often helped out with the housework, so she ought to have been
        <p></p>used to seeing him in his apron, but she felt a strange sort of embarrassment
        <p></p>when he greeted her so naturally, with a gentle look in his eyes.
        <p></p>…Greeting me like that, it's like we're a couple or something.
        <p></p>Her earlier conversation with Chitose was probably having an effect on
        <p></p>her.
        <p></p>She felt ashamed for imagining such a thing when they weren't even
        <p></p>dating yet, but nevertheless, a smile slowly crept across her face.
        <p></p>"I—I just got back."
        <p></p>She immediately composed her expression, but it was impossible to hide
        <p></p>the agitation in her shrill voice. This drew a puzzled response from Amane.
        <p></p>"Is something the matter?"
        <p></p>"N-no, um, you just don't often greet me in your apron, so it's kind of
        <p></p>novel, is all."
        <p></p>"Ah, that's what it is. I guess it's usually the other way around, huh?
        <p></p>Since you don't usually come back very late."
        <p></p>Amane readily accepted her somewhat forced explanation and smiled a
        <p></p>little.
        <p></p>"Well, as you can see, I went ahead and started the dinner preparations,
        <p></p>but I was just thinking I should have gone out to meet you after all. I'm sure
        <p></p>it was kind of dark on the walk back," Amane said, then glanced at the
        <p></p>living room clock for a moment and frowned.
        <p></p>Mahiru shook her head slowly.
        <p></p>Sure, the sun had already set by the time she headed home at six
        <p></p>o'clock, but it wasn't as though the curtain of night had completely fallen. It
        <p></p>was a perfectly normal time for a high school student to be returning home.
        <p></p>"There was still plenty of foot traffic, and it was still relatively light
        <p></p>outside. Plus, I would have taken a taxi if the sun had completely set and
        <p></p>the road looked dangerous."
        <p></p>"That's all very good, but you know I would come meet you if you
        <p></p>called me, right? You can count on me."
        <p></p>"T-taking advantage of you like that—"
        <p></p>"Come on, stop. If I'm around, I want you to take advantage of me.
        <p></p>Although I may not be the most reliable."
        <p></p>"…You are very reliable."
        <p></p>"Oh, really?"
        <p></p>Amane was smiling just a little awkwardly, perhaps because he thought
        <p></p>of himself as unreliable. But from Mahiru's perspective, he was more than
        <p></p>dependable. More than anyone else, out of all the people she knew.
        <p></p>Maybe the results of all his training were starting to show, because it
        <p></p>was clear that his physique was shaping up bit by bit. Once he had had a bit
        <p></p>of a tendency to hunch over, but now his posture had improved, almost as a
        <p></p>manifestation of his newfound confidence. He was stooping forward a bit at
        <p></p>the moment to meet Mahiru's gaze, but his eyes were earnestly kind and
        <p></p>full of concern for her well-being. She felt her chest gradually growing
        <p></p>warm.
        <p></p>"I, um, I always rely on you."
        <p></p>"I'm the one who's always relying on you, so you should at least lean on
        <p></p>me in cases like this."
        <p></p>Amane put on a faint smile, extended an arm that looked a little more
        <p></p>muscular than before, and gently patted her on the head.
        <p></p>Normally, he didn't touch her without a good reason, and yet at times
        <p></p>like this, he did so quite naturally. Mahiru had slightly complicated feelings
        <p></p>about it.
        <p></p>She knew he probably wasn't really aware of it, but as the person on the
        <p></p>receiving end, on the one hand, it felt nice and made her happy, but on the
        <p></p>other, it was embarrassing and made her worry that she was the only one
        <p></p>who felt something between them.
        <p></p>…At times like this, he treats me like a little child.
        <p></p>However, she didn't entirely dislike that.
        <p></p>Actually, far from disliking it, she wanted him to do it more, but that
        <p></p>wasn't something that she could just ask for, so all she could do was
        <p></p>appreciate it when Amane did touch her.
        <p></p>As she tried to hold her inexpressible emotions in check, Mahiru gave
        <p></p>Amane a look that was ever so slightly reproachful, and he blinked
        <p></p>dramatically in surprise.
        <p></p>"I washed my hands earlier, and I'll do it again before we start cooking,
        <p></p>okay?"
        <p></p>"…I'm not worried about something like that, geez."
        <p></p>It was probably impossible for Mahiru to tell him precisely how she was
        <p></p>feeling, and she didn't necessarily want him to know anyway.
        <p></p>But since it would have been unfair for her to be the only one with a
        <p></p>pounding heart, she rubbed her head against Amane's chest for a moment.
        <p></p>She could hear him getting flustered, but Mahiru pretended not to notice
        <p></p>and made the most of the situation. Amane's sounds of agitation gradually
        <p></p>transformed into gentle, permissive noises of resignation.
        <p></p>Mahiru knew that those sounds were for her ears only, and her mouth
        <p></p>automatically curled into a gentle smile.
        <p></p>But since there was no way she could possibly let Amane see her sappy
        <p></p>grin, after enjoying the feeling of his fingers in her hair for a little longer,
        <p></p>she put on a relaxed expression and raised her head.
        <p></p>Leaving his hand on her head, Amane looked down at her with a slight
        <p></p>flush on his face. His clear, dark eyes were wavering slightly, revealing his
        <p></p>unrest.
        <p></p>When Mahiru smiled with a little bit of satisfaction at his expression,
        <p></p>Amane brushed his hair back lightly, as if he was stroking his own head,
        <p></p>and let out a sigh.
        <p></p>"…I'm gonna get back to cooking."
        <p></p>He's running away.
        <p></p>That's what she thought, but she didn't say a thing. She thought that if
        <p></p>she did, Amane would become sulky. Mahiru tried to follow Amane into
        <p></p>the kitchen, but he lightly caught hold of her shoulders and stopped her.
        <p></p>"You just relax in the living room, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"…I can help."
        <p></p>"Today's my day to cook. If you came all the way over here to relax,
        <p></p>then you should actually relax. The menu isn't that challenging. Plus,
        <p></p>you're always making food for me."
        <p></p>"…And you're always helping me in the kitchen, aren't you, Amane?"
        <p></p>"But you take the lead, since I'm not good for much. Our labor isn't
        <p></p>comparable. Now, come on and leave it to me. Think of it as letting me
        <p></p>practice."
        <p></p>His voice was gentle and tender but had a strange compelling power to it
        <p></p>that wasn't going to let her refuse. Shrinking back, she tried to continue
        <p></p>objecting, but Amane just leisurely shook his head and wouldn't let her
        <p></p>enter the kitchen.
        <p></p>"Are you that worried about me cooking alone?"
        <p></p>"That's not it, but it just doesn't feel right having you do everything…"
        <p></p>"Well, then maybe you could help set the table."
        <p></p>Amane seemed adamant about refusing to let her help with the cooking.
        <p></p>In lieu of complaining, Mahiru butted her head against his upper arm, and
        <p></p>Amane put on a somewhat mischievous smile and rubbed her head again.
        <p></p>Ultimately, Mahiru ended up leaving the whole process of cooking up to
        <p></p>Amane, but perhaps not unexpectedly, she was anxious about Amane and
        <p></p>waited restlessly in the living room.
        <p></p>She knew perfectly well that Amane was more or less capable of
        <p></p>cooking decently, but her concerns were her concerns.
        <p></p>As she uneasily watched a television program, she also monitored his
        <p></p>progress, keeping an ear out for any noises and glancing into the kitchen
        <p></p>from time to time. But fortunately, Amane managed to get dinner on the
        <p></p>table without any major complications.
        <p></p>While he was cooking, a spicy aroma had drifted out of the kitchen to
        <p></p>whet her appetite, and she'd started to suspect that he was making keema
        <p></p>curry.
        <p></p>Amane had been the one to decide what he was making that day, and
        <p></p>Mahiru had predicted that it might be curry. But she didn't know for sure
        <p></p>that it was keema curry until he was plating it up.
        <p></p>"I made sure to taste it as I went, okay?"
        <p></p>Mahiru couldn't help but laugh at Amane when he reassured her.
        <p></p>Perhaps he was unnerved by her staring, and he grumbled a little peevishly,
        <p></p>"Guess you really don't trust me."
        <p></p>It was Mahiru's turn to pat Amane on the head as they took their seats.
        <p></p>Dinner was a simple menu of keema curry and salad, and at a glance,
        <p></p>she couldn't spot any issues with it.
        <p></p>Amane had always been the type who could make things that tasted
        <p></p>better than they looked, so long as he studied the recipe and faithfully
        <p></p>followed along, so she hadn't been all that worried.
        <p></p>She glanced over at Amane and got a somewhat expectant look in
        <p></p>return.
        <p></p>Mahiru normally made delicious meals, she knew. She expected that
        <p></p>Amane was probably anxious to hear her appraisal of his cooking.
        <p></p>Amane looked strangely adorable as he fidgeted slightly, and Mahiru
        <p></p>smiled in spite of herself.
        <p></p>"…What is it?"
        <p></p>"Nothing at all. All right, let's eat."
        <p></p>You're so cute.
        <p></p>Still smiling, she pressed her hands together and gave thanks for the
        <p></p>food and for Amane, who had cooked it. Then she picked up her spoon.
        <p></p>Feeling his eyes on her, Mahiru brought Amane's homemade keema
        <p></p>curry to her mouth. It had a gentle sort of flavor.
        <p></p>He had probably used restraint when adding the spices, since neither of
        <p></p>them was a particularly big fan of spicy food.
        <p></p>A small amount of spiciness came through, but on the whole, the curry
        <p></p>had a mellow, homey taste. More than anything else, the impression was
        <p></p>that it simply tasted good.
        <p></p>The knowledge that Amane had made it was probably the best seasoning
        <p></p>of all.
        <p></p>"…It's delicious."
        <p></p>"Yeah? I'm glad."
        <p></p>She gave her honest impression, and Amane must have been relieved,
        <p></p>because his mouth spread into a soft smile, and he seemed to relax. Just as
        <p></p>Mahiru was thinking that he looked younger and cuter than usual, grinning
        <p></p>like that, she felt keenly aware that she had fallen head over heels for
        <p></p>Amane.
        <p></p>Amane looked delighted as he also took a bite of his keema curry.
        <p></p>Mahiru took another bite, then recalled Amane's past cooking and mumbled
        <p></p>quietly, "You've really improved your culinary skills."
        <p></p>Amane had never been incapable of cooking, he was just awful at it out
        <p></p>of a stereotypical lack of experience.
        <p></p>Luckily, his palate was normal, and in fact he was able to perceive more
        <p></p>subtle flavors than most, probably thanks to his parents. And he was
        <p></p>someone who thought things through rationally, which made it easy for him
        <p></p>to understand the purpose of the various steps in the cooking process. So
        <p></p>naturally, with a little experience, he made a capable cook.
        <p></p>"That's because I've been looking at recipes I got from my mom, and
        <p></p>helping you out in the kitchen a lot, and making an effort to practice on my
        <p></p>own on the weekends. I've gotten better."
        <p></p>"Oh-ho, impressive!"
        <p></p>"Well, I did rely on modern conveniences quite a bit this time. The
        <p></p>seasoning is mostly thanks to the store-bought roux, and I cut up the
        <p></p>vegetables with that device I bought the other day."
        <p></p>Amane looked slightly apologetic as he poked at the finely cut
        <p></p>vegetables in his keema curry with his spoon.
        <p></p>The "modern convenience" he was talking about was a handy tool he
        <p></p>had recently bought that made it easy to finely chop vegetables by putting
        <p></p>them in a case and pulling a cord to cut them up with an attached blade.
        <p></p>He had purchased it with the aim of saving time and simplifying the
        <p></p>cooking process, and it had been more useful to Amane than to Mahiru.
        <p></p>Mahiru used it sometimes as well, when she was short on time, and
        <p></p>thought it was good for some things, so she wasn't opposed to using it or
        <p></p>seeing it used. But Amane seemed to have some reservations.
        <p></p>"It's made and sold because people need it, so you should go ahead and
        <p></p>use it where you can. There's no problem, as long as everything turns out
        <p></p>edible and tasty."
        <p></p>"Well, you're right about that, but it made me realize how amazing you
        <p></p>are, since you're so skilled at using a kitchen knife. Being capable and
        <p></p>being proficient are two totally different things, you know? I'm still just
        <p></p>passable at best. Not just cooking but in other areas, too. I feel bad for
        <p></p>depending on you so much, and I know it'll cause issues going forward if
        <p></p>I'm bad at housework."
        <p></p>"You're not wrong per se, but you do the shopping and all the manual
        <p></p>labor. When people are living together, dividing up the chores is the most
        <p></p>efficient way to do things. As you might expect, I'll ask you to keep doing
        <p></p>your own laundry, but otherwise, we can share the work and let our skills
        <p></p>complement each other's."
        <p></p>She'd meant to express that she wasn't expecting perfection from
        <p></p>Amane, but for some reason, he stiffened and dropped his spoon in his
        <p></p>curry.
        <p></p>Luckily, he dropped it over the plate, so that was fine—if he had
        <p></p>dropped it on the floor, it probably would have been a bit of a pain to clean
        <p></p>up.
        <p></p>There was a little bit of curry on the handle, so Mahiru pulled out a wet
        <p></p>wipe from the container that was sitting on the table and tried to hand it to
        <p></p>Amane. But Amane just kept staring at her and didn't take it.
        <p></p>Wondering whether she had said something strange, Mahiru tilted her
        <p></p>head in a forced way, and his dark eyes darted around the room as if he was
        <p></p>distressed.
        <p></p>"…Ah, I, um—it's nothing."
        <p></p>"It doesn't seem like it was nothing."
        <p></p>"It's fine. Come on, let's eat while it's still hot."
        <p></p>He seemed as if he wanted to say something, but she could tell that
        <p></p>whatever it was, she wasn't likely to coax it out of him.
        <p></p>Mahiru gave him a pointed look of disappointment, but Amane just
        <p></p>accepted the wet wipe and wiped his spoon clean. He didn't open his mouth
        <p></p>again to talk.
        <p></p>Amane silently shoveled his keema curry into his mouth and didn't look
        <p></p>in her direction.
        <p></p>His face flushed slightly red as he ate the curry, though it wasn't very
        <p></p>spicy, and he sighed as if he was having a hard time. Mahiru also sighed
        <p></p>quietly and resumed eating.
        <p></p>Ultimately, after eating dinner, they spent the evening in their usual manner.
        <p></p>They washed the dishes together as they always did, laid out their
        <p></p>homework and completed it, laughed together at whatever was on TV, and
        <p></p>finally Mahiru went home to go to bed.
        <p></p>Though she would have liked to stay at Amane's place a little longer,
        <p></p>she needed to get changed early and prepare for her first ever good-night
        <p></p>phone call.
        <p></p>When Mahiru finished changing and was ready to get in bed, she took a
        <p></p>look at herself and let out an unintentional sigh.
        <p></p>…I feel like I'm too excited for this.
        <p></p>Particularly since she wasn't making a video call. Still, she had spent
        <p></p>longer in the bath than usual and taken a long time grooming her hair and
        <p></p>skin for no reason. And she was wearing her new favorite nightdress, a (not
        <p></p>see-through) white silk negligee decorated with lace that she had bought on
        <p></p>a shopping trip with Chitose. Chitose had declared that it was "absolutely to
        <p></p>Amane's taste."
        <p></p>Mahiru understood that girls valued fashion even when no one else
        <p></p>could see it, but she had a feeling that this was less of a fashion statement
        <p></p>and more like getting dressed for battle.
        <p></p>She wondered why she was getting so worked up, even though all she
        <p></p>was doing was making a simple phone call.
        <p></p>And yet despite being so fully prepared, Mahiru was unable to make her
        <p></p>move. She sat there with her smartphone displaying the call screen.
        <p></p>It was all very good to have decided to call him, but just what reason
        <p></p>should she give for calling?
        <p></p>Neither of them was the type of person to call unless they needed
        <p></p>something, so she really had no idea. She rarely ever called Amane to begin
        <p></p>with, so a good-night phone call was beyond the pale.
        <p></p>I decided I would call, but what if I bother him?
        <p></p>She worried about interrupting him as he got ready for bed or waking
        <p></p>him if he was already asleep. He might oversleep or get insufficient rest,
        <p></p>because of her phone call.
        <p></p>The more she thought about it, the more her hesitation took control of
        <p></p>her fingertips, and she couldn't even get them to tap the call button.
        <p></p>She'd always thought of Amane as cautious and a late bloomer, but she
        <p></p>was even more of a wuss. She even felt a little bit like crying as she toppled
        <p></p>over onto the bed, still clutching her smartphone in indecision.
        <p></p>She rested her phone on her chest and mumbled, "I should just give up."
        <p></p>Just as she went to close the call screen—a jaunty melody began to stream
        <p></p>from the phone.
        <p></p>She was stunned for a moment as the phone suddenly played a tune that
        <p></p>she so rarely heard, but she soon realized that it was the sound of a phone
        <p></p>call connecting and jumped up. Apparently, she had accidentally made the
        <p></p>call.
        <p></p>Before she could cancel the call in a panic, she heard her own name
        <p></p>whispered through the smartphone speaker in a curious tone of voice.
        <p></p>"Mahiru?"
        <p></p>His voice was somewhat lower and hoarser than it had been when she'd
        <p></p>heard it several hours earlier, perhaps because he had been sleeping.
        <p></p>Still unprepared for what she had done, Mahiru looked timidly at the
        <p></p>screen, on which was displayed the icon for a familiar chat application,
        <p></p>conspicuously showing that there was a call in progress.
        <p></p>"Did something happen? You don't usually call this late."
        <p></p>"Ah, n-no, um…it—it's nothing, I just…s-sorry, did I wake you…?"
        <p></p>If she had woken him up, that would mean she had interrupted his sleep
        <p></p>for her own amusement.
        <p></p>Surely, it was much too selfish of her to continue presuming upon
        <p></p>Amane's kindness, no matter how nice he was to her.
        <p></p>Mahiru bit her lip, ready for him to be angry with her, when she heard a
        <p></p>small chuckle from the other end of the line.
        <p></p>"Nah, I already got ready for bed, but I wasn't sleeping. It's fine if you
        <p></p>want to give me a call for no particular reason. It was just sudden, so it
        <p></p>surprised me."
        <p></p>"I—I guess it was. Sorry to call so suddenly…"
        <p></p>Surely, it must have been a nuisance for her to call right before bed
        <p></p>without arranging it beforehand.
        <p></p>She had been so eager before, but now she just felt embarrassed, and her
        <p></p>voice trailed off. But Amane maintained the same gentle tone and kindly
        <p></p>murmured, "You really don't have to apologize. I'm happy to hear your
        <p></p>voice."
        <p></p>Mahiru bit her lip even harder.
        <p></p>…That's just not fair.
        <p></p>He spoke in a caring, apologetic tone, so as not to cause Mahiru any
        <p></p>more anxiety than necessary, and whether he was aware of it himself or not,
        <p></p>his words and voice were indulgent. Mahiru found the whole thing utterly
        <p></p>endearing, and her heart began to ache in a different way than it ever had
        <p></p>before.
        <p></p>She imagined Amane laughing at her slightly as she sat there silenced by
        <p></p>shame and embarrassment at the loud, rhythmic pounding of her heart.
        <p></p>"…You couldn't sleep?"
        <p></p>There was no criticism, just a question in a gentle voice. But Mahiru was
        <p></p>unable to summon up an answer. She just stayed silent.
        <p></p>Not only had her reason for calling been selfish, but it was also the type
        <p></p>of objective that she couldn't come out and explain. There was just no way
        <p></p>she could admit it to Amane.
        <p></p>But it would have felt dishonest not to give a reason for phoning at
        <p></p>night, so she was greatly perplexed over how to explain it to him.
        <p></p>"I can't sleep, either, so could we stay on the line a little longer?"
        <p></p>An easy, smooth, gentle voice came through the speaker. It freed Mahiru
        <p></p>from the paralysis caused by the overwhelming embarrassment of the
        <p></p>thought of honestly confiding in him.
        <p></p>His persistently kind voice wasn't asking for any kind of explanation.
        <p></p>She could simply sense his earnestly peaceful and considerate heart.
        <p></p>"…Sure."
        <p></p>She understood that she was being very dishonest, but she didn't say
        <p></p>anything about it and just took advantage of Amane's kindness.
        <p></p>Most likely, Amane really did think that Mahiru had been having trouble
        <p></p>sleeping and had called him out of anxiety.
        <p></p>Maybe he understood that she would sometimes have nightmares and
        <p></p>cry out in her sleep.
        <p></p>Amane let out a relieved sigh when Mahiru quietly agreed to stay on the
        <p></p>phone, then chuckled quietly.
        <p></p>"Great… You know, we hardly ever talk on the phone like this, so it's
        <p></p>kind of fresh and new."
        <p></p>"It…sure is. We are basically always together, so if I have anything to
        <p></p>say, I can say it directly to you."
        <p></p>"Maybe it feels this way precisely because we're so close. You're
        <p></p>always by my side, so I've just been saying things directly to you, too…
        <p></p>This feels kind of funny, huh?"
        <p></p>"…Yeah."
        <p></p>Even though they were in neighboring apartments, and even though she
        <p></p>spent most of her time over at his place, just the act of using the phone as an
        <p></p>intermediary made it feel like a special time.
        <p></p>When she heard the sigh mixed with a hint of laughter come through the
        <p></p>speaker, Mahiru's mind produced a ticklish sensation, as if that sigh was
        <p></p>tracing slowly over her skin.
        <p></p>It felt nice and just a little bit tantalizing.
        <p></p>She lay down and twisted her body into a more comfortable position,
        <p></p>while listening carefully with the phone to her ear.
        <p></p>"Come to think of it"—Amane spoke up on the other end of the phone,
        <p></p>sounding like he had found a topic—"I forgot to ask you about it, but you
        <p></p>said you went out with Chitose today, right?"
        <p></p>"Yes. Well, all we did was go to a café and talk, though."
        <p></p>"That's great, though, that you were able to relax. Was it fun?"
        <p></p>"Yeah. I always feel energized when I'm with Chitose; she really lifts
        <p></p>my mood."
        <p></p>"Good; as long as you had fun, that's great. What do you two usually do
        <p></p>when you hang out?"
        <p></p>"We don't really do anything special, you know? We get drinks at a café,
        <p></p>or go shopping and look at clothes and accessories, or see a movie…
        <p></p>completely normal things."
        <p></p>"Huh. And here I was sure that Chitose was dragging you around to all
        <p></p>kinds of weird places."
        <p></p>"If she heard you say that, she'd get mad and say, 'How rude!' you
        <p></p>know?"
        <p></p>He seemed to be under the impression that Chitose was a real social
        <p></p>butterfly, since she had a public image as an active person.
        <p></p>To be sure, Chitose was the outdoorsy type, and she did make her way to
        <p></p>all sorts of places, but she would never force Mahiru to go along with her,
        <p></p>and she knew plenty of places where normal high school girls could go to
        <p></p>have fun.
        <p></p>Before she got to know Chitose, Mahiru had almost never gone out to
        <p></p>have fun, so she was quite happy to have a friend to take her around like she
        <p></p>did.
        <p></p>"Sometimes, she has information about places I would never go, or even
        <p></p>connections there, so I figure it must be a little scary for you when she takes
        <p></p>you to places you don't know."
        <p></p>"Well, she does sometimes take me with her to places I don't know, but
        <p></p>as you would expect, they're safe and interesting places. The other day, she
        <p></p>took me to a place where we could go bouldering. As you can imagine, I
        <p></p>had never done it before, but it was fun."
        <p></p>"Ah, bouldering? A long time ago, my mom took me to one of the
        <p></p>places in my hometown, but I could hardly make it up the wall. Not as bad
        <p></p>as someone who's totally nonathletic, mind you."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh. Now you could probably do a great job, I bet! You've been
        <p></p>working so hard at your weight lifting and all."
        <p></p>"I hope I've gotten at least a little bit stronger. Maybe you could show
        <p></p>me that climbing gym sometime soon."
        <p></p>"…Sure."
        <p></p>She had agreed quite easily. But when she stopped to think about it, she
        <p></p>realized that Amane had just asked her to go on an outing. Amane didn't
        <p></p>seem particularly worked up about it and was acting natural.
        <p></p>…Would that make it a…date?
        <p></p>If he just wanted to go to the bouldering gym, he could have asked
        <p></p>Chitose. So if he was asking Mahiru to show it to him, she could probably
        <p></p>take that to mean that he was asking because he wanted to go with Mahiru.
        <p></p>She had a feeling Chitose would have something to say about how
        <p></p>unsexy the destination was, but at Amane's invitation, Mahiru's lips
        <p></p>spontaneously curled into the arch of a smile.
        <p></p>"I'd be happy to go on an outing with you, Amane."
        <p></p>She was grinning from ear to ear from the thrill of actually honestly
        <p></p>expressing her feelings out loud, and no matter how she tried, there was no
        <p></p>dampening her excitement.
        <p></p>She was glad from the bottom of her heart that Amane was not in the
        <p></p>room with her. Surely, such an unguarded expression was not something fit
        <p></p>for him to see.
        <p></p>Mahiru rolled back and forth on top of her bed, delighted at the prospect
        <p></p>of an outing with the person she loved.
        <p></p>This alone made it worth calling.
        <p></p>It was probably her naïveté that made her go weak with joy.
        <p></p>The slight nervousness that had remained even after she started the
        <p></p>phone call disappeared, and instead she felt relief and a sudden drowsiness.
        <p></p>She was in a happy mood, and the onset of sleepiness made her want to
        <p></p>bask in that feeling all the more.
        <p></p>Mahiru was laughing silently to herself, noticing how difficult it was
        <p></p>getting to hold her eyelids open, when she heard a quiet voice from the
        <p></p>other end of the line.
        <p></p>"…So listen, could I ask you about something that's been on my mind?"
        <p></p>"…Something that's been on your mind?"
        <p></p>She quickly responded by asking him what it was, resisting the growing
        <p></p>urge to doze off.
        <p></p>The somewhat hesitant voice on the other side of the phone continued,
        <p></p>"So today you said something, and I'm not sure what you meant by it.
        <p></p>Something about us complementing each other."
        <p></p>Mahiru considered his question, which was less articulate than usual,
        <p></p>and then answered slowly.
        <p></p>"…You and I are always together, right? As long as we're…together like
        <p></p>this, helping each other with our difficulties is the most efficient way to
        <p></p>live…I think."
        <p></p>It almost went without saying, but it was more efficient for the person
        <p></p>who was skilled at a task to be the one to handle it.
        <p></p>If Mahiru tried to do physical labor, it would take a while, and there
        <p></p>might even be things that she simply could not do with her feminine
        <p></p>physique.
        <p></p>When it came to cooking, if Amane did it, some ingredients would go to
        <p></p>waste, and it might take extra time.
        <p></p>With the two of them there, they could make things easier by each
        <p></p>taking charge of their areas of specialty, so it was obvious that that was
        <p></p>what they should do.
        <p></p>When Mahiru answered in a soft, sleepy voice, Amane mumbled "…
        <p></p>Yeah, like, that's true, but that wasn't exactly what I wanted to ask."
        <p></p>So then what are you asking…?
        <p></p>But instead of actually asking the question, Mahiru made a faint
        <p></p>questioning sound in her throat, and an answer didn't seem forthcoming
        <p></p>from Amane.
        <p></p>"No, never mind… If I ask you for the precise nuance, I might just die."
        <p></p>"…Why…?"
        <p></p>"I just will. It's fine, don't worry about it. I don't need to know."
        <p></p>Refusing so politely was Amane's way of clearly saying he wasn't going
        <p></p>to answer any more questions about it.
        <p></p>When he got like this, Amane hardly ever said any more, no matter how
        <p></p>she persisted, so it was best not to question him too insistently. He usually
        <p></p>just said "It's fine" to pacify Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Never mind about me… More importantly, Mahiru, you must be
        <p></p>sleepy?"
        <p></p>He could probably tell from her voice that Mahiru was losing her battle
        <p></p>against sleep.
        <p></p>"Well, it's about time to hang up—"
        <p></p>"…No. Just a little longer…"
        <p></p>Even Mahiru thought she sounded a little childish, but she wanted to
        <p></p>hear Amane's voice for just a little bit longer.
        <p></p>She hardly ever got a chance like this.
        <p></p>A chance to doze off while concentrating on Amane's voice.
        <p></p>Her fading sense of reason told her that she should stop this, that there
        <p></p>must be limits to her selfishness, but all of her hesitation melted right away
        <p></p>when she heard his gentle voice say, "Okay."
        <p></p>Relieved by his acceptance, she nervously leaned close to her
        <p></p>smartphone, which she had laid down on top of the sheets, holding her
        <p></p>chest, which was tingling with warmth.
        <p></p>"…Amane, your voice is so calming and nice to listen to."
        <p></p>"I think that's the first time I've ever been told that."
        <p></p>"Oh, really…? It's a soft, kind voice; I feel like I'm floating."
        <p></p>The quality of his voice, mellow and clear and not too low, was
        <p></p>earnestly gentle, mild, and indulgent.
        <p></p>Listening to those gentle whispers, mixed with quiet sighing, made her
        <p></p>feel as though all of the strength was flowing right out of her body.
        <p></p>It wasn't an unpleasant feeling; in fact, it felt nice.
        <p></p>His warm voice was only for her ears, and not for anyone else. It slowly
        <p></p>lulled her into a sea of sleepiness on a tide of joy.
        <p></p>His voice permeated her body and gave her the sensation that she was
        <p></p>floating on a cloud.
        <p></p>…I want to hear more.
        <p></p>She wanted him to say her name in that voice.
        <p></p>"…Is it really that nice?"
        <p></p>"Amane, your voice…I really…love it. I want you to…call my name…
        <p></p>more…"
        <p></p>Hearing him say her name was her favorite thing.
        <p></p>Before she met Amane, nobody had really called her by her first name.
        <p></p>Despite not loving their own child, Mahiru's parents had nevertheless
        <p></p>put some thought into her name, combining the character for morning from
        <p></p>her father's name and the character for evening from her mother's to give
        <p></p>her a name that invoked the afternoon. She had never liked it.
        <p></p>But ever since meeting and falling in love with Amane, she had come to
        <p></p>appreciate her own name.
        <p></p>She really loved it when Amane called her simply Mahiru, not "the
        <p></p>angel" or the last name that marked her as a member of the Shiina family.
        <p></p>Hearing him whisper it like this made her so, so happy.
        <p></p>It was a warm, fuzzy feeling.
        <p></p>As her thoughts drifted, Mahiru asked him to call her name.
        <p></p>She heard a noise from the other end of the call, and it almost sounded
        <p></p>as if Amane had caught his breath or was having trouble swallowing
        <p></p>something, which made Mahiru tilt her head to the side in puzzlement.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, listen—"
        <p></p>Amane said her name in a tone of voice like he had something he
        <p></p>wanted to tell her, and Mahiru closed her eyes without really knowing why.
        <p></p>She felt as if she would be able to concentrate on his voice like that.
        <p></p>In a peaceful, blissful mood, she directed all her focus to her sense of
        <p></p>hearing and could faintly make out the sound of breathing, like a quiet sigh.
        <p></p>"…No, don't worry about it."
        <p></p>He started to say something, then, sure enough, gave up on it and
        <p></p>stopped talking. The phone speaker just vibrated with the quiet sound of his
        <p></p>breath.
        <p></p>Even that regular rhythm was a delight to Mahiru, and she hummed
        <p></p>contentedly and gave up on catching hold of her gently wavering thoughts.
        <p></p>She simply drifted along in the comfortable silence.
        <p></p>As she nodded off, her own thoughts drifted even further afield, but
        <p></p>somehow she perceived that as someone else's problem.
        <p></p>"Mahiru?"
        <p></p>After a short silence that had seemed very long to Mahiru, she heard
        <p></p>Amane speak carefully, as though he was checking on her, in a voice that
        <p></p>threatened to disappear into a little sigh.
        <p></p>Knowing that she had to answer, Mahiru tried to raise her voice, but a
        <p></p>feeling of restful weariness would not permit her to give voice to any more
        <p></p>words. She tried with all her might to speak up and only produced a quiet,
        <p></p>hoarse moan.
        <p></p>Amane let out a sigh that sounded like a gentle laugh.
        <p></p>"…Good night, Mahiru."
        <p></p>With his voice, even gentler and sweeter than before, slowly tickling her
        <p></p>eardrums, Mahiru could no longer hold out, and she surrendered herself to
        <p></p>the irresistible drowsiness.
        <p></p>The following evening, when Mahiru went over to Amane's place as she
        <p></p>always did after getting home from school and changing her clothes, she
        <p></p>found that Amane was looking somewhat sullen.
        <p></p>He was waiting for her in the hallway before the living room, and he
        <p></p>was obviously in a grumpy mood.
        <p></p>"So listen, don't you think it would be best to use restraint when it
        <p></p>comes to phone calls before bed?"
        <p></p>At school, he had been giving her looks as though he had something he
        <p></p>wanted to say, but of course she couldn't walk right up and ask him there,
        <p></p>so she had been planning to do so once they were alone together. But…she
        <p></p>had never expected him to complain, and she frowned.
        <p></p>Is it possible that I made a mistake calling Amane yesterday…? Could
        <p></p>he be offended that I fell asleep during the phone call that I initiated…?
        <p></p>She was the one who had called him, but partway through the call, she
        <p></p>had been struck by drowsiness, and her memory of their conversation got
        <p></p>hazy.
        <p></p>She had been halfway asleep, so she didn't really remember what she
        <p></p>had said. Perhaps she had said something to antagonize Amane.
        <p></p>She wanted to believe that she hadn't said anything strange, but when
        <p></p>she saw the way that Amane was glaring at her, she lost her confidence.
        <p></p>"D-did I say something careless…?"
        <p></p>"Not necessarily, but letting people see you or hear you when you're
        <p></p>half-asleep is all pretty risky, I think."
        <p></p>He cautioned her very seriously, in a somewhat stiff tone of voice.
        <p></p>Mahiru felt a sudden upwelling of regret and was convinced she had gone
        <p></p>too far.
        <p></p>"I'm sorry, if my voice was unpleasant—"
        <p></p>"That's not it… It was…too relaxed, so I think it's unwise to let other
        <p></p>people hear it."
        <p></p>"…Too relaxed?"
        <p></p>"Anyway, you can't. It's no good."
        <p></p>"…Even with you on the other end? If you don't like it…"
        <p></p>"It's not that I don't like it, it's just that…you shouldn't do it. Especially
        <p></p>with me on the other end. My heart just can't take it, and I really… I just
        <p></p>can't deal with it, okay?"
        <p></p>"Can't deal with it?"
        <p></p>"Never mind."
        <p></p>Mahiru shot Amane a look of unconcealed displeasure when he tried to
        <p></p>avoid giving her a complete answer. But Amane seemed unlikely to give in
        <p></p>and simply insisted, "Anyway, you just can't."
        <p></p>Upset by her utter lack of progress, Mahiru banged her balled-up fists
        <p></p>softly against his upper arm in open protest.
        <p></p>She got the feeling that he was hiding something important, and it made
        <p></p>her uncomfortable.
        <p></p>She searched Amane's face for an explanation, quite anxious that she
        <p></p>had inadvertently said something strange, and Amane frowned, looking
        <p></p>troubled, and then sighed loudly.
        <p></p>Mahiru began to tremble, convinced that his sigh had come from a place
        <p></p>of disgust, when Amane gently reached for her.
        <p></p>Slowly, his bony fingers gently brushed aside a piece of hair that was
        <p></p>hanging over her cheek. She could feel the cool air on her exposed ear as
        <p></p>Amane bent forward a little and slowly brought his face close to hers.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, enough. You just shouldn't…okay?"
        <p></p>He was so close, and his gentle, charming voice and firm-but-soothing
        <p></p>tone sent a strange, tingly shock shooting up her spine.
        <p></p>"Wah?!" An awkward squeak escaped Mahiru's mouth.
        <p></p>The sensation running through her body was less of a chill and more like
        <p></p>an enticing sort of electricity she had never felt before.
        <p></p>His voice snatched away all the strength from her body and made her
        <p></p>weak in the knees, as if she was melting from the inside out. She nearly fell
        <p></p>on her rump right then and there, whereupon Amane immediately put an
        <p></p>arm around her back and pulled her toward him, and she plunged into his
        <p></p>chest.
        <p></p>She moved her mouth, but her voice didn't come out right.
        <p></p>…What a voice…
        <p></p>Both she and Amane made noises that they could never let other people
        <p></p>hear.
        <p></p>Mahiru's because it was terribly pathetic. And Amane's because—
        <p></p>"…Are you all right?" Amane asked in a concerned tone as Mahiru's
        <p></p>body went limp.
        <p></p>He picked her up in his arms and carried her to the sofa in her weakened
        <p></p>state.
        <p></p>He moved more easily than before, and in a small corner of her heart,
        <p></p>she was impressed by how much he had changed, while at the same time,
        <p></p>his line from earlier played repeatedly in her mind, and the admiration she
        <p></p>felt all transformed into a violently throbbing ache in her chest.
        <p></p>Amane looked at Mahiru, who was in a rough state, her heart still
        <p></p>thumping loudly, and mumbled quietly, "Mahiru, your ears are super
        <p></p>sensitive, huh?"
        <p></p>In a panic, Mahiru grabbed on to the hem of Amane's clothes, after he
        <p></p>took a seat next to her.
        <p></p>"N-no, this is, um, because your voice…"
        <p></p>"My voice?"
        <p></p>"…It's extremely…not good. Very not okay at all."
        <p></p>She stared up at Amane beside her, wondering when he had learned to
        <p></p>produce a voice with so much allure. Amane's eyes widened in a look of
        <p></p>amazement, and then he sighed dramatically.
        <p></p>"…I also got the feeling that our conversation yesterday was a different
        <p></p>type of thing, so I think that goes for both of us, but—"
        <p></p>"Ah—"
        <p></p>"Anyway, we shouldn't do it again. Okay?"
        <p></p>Before she could ask for details, he grabbed her gently by the shoulders,
        <p></p>and this time he spoke to her in a voice that was simply kind, looking her
        <p></p>directly in the eyes as if he were trying to persuade a child of something, so
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded meekly. If she had disagreed, he probably would have taken
        <p></p>advantage of their proximity to whisper in her ear again until she
        <p></p>acquiesced.
        <p></p>Mahiru was also having a hard time grappling with feelings she didn't
        <p></p>quite understand, so she figured that it was best to withdraw gracefully. And
        <p></p>when she gave Amane a dissatisfied look, he gently but sternly raised his
        <p></p>hand up to Mahiru's ear to discourage her. She understood that he was
        <p></p>telling her that for her own good, that she shouldn't bring up this topic
        <p></p>again, and she held her tongue.
        <p></p>…Somehow, I feel like I'm the one who's become more aware of him and
        <p></p>not the other way around.
        <p></p>She had tried calling Amane on the phone in order to get him to notice
        <p></p>her, but ultimately, she was the one who ended up noticing new things about
        <p></p>him.
        <p></p>All she had managed to do was to show him that her heart throbbed for
        <p></p>him and she couldn't calm down, so it was probably safe to say that her
        <p></p>scheme was a failure.
        <p></p>Even as she thought that things really weren't going well, the fact of the
        <p></p>matter was that she was content to have learned about a side of Amane that
        <p></p>she normally never saw or heard and to have settled down to sleep with a
        <p></p>very happy feeling after being able to hear his voice right before bed. This
        <p></p>was probably better than both of them becoming overly aware of the other
        <p></p>and things getting awkward.
        <p></p>"…That's just a little bit disappointing," she mumbled quietly, then
        <p></p>swallowed any last wisps of shame and shut her mouth tight.
