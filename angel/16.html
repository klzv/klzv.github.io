        When will you two be done?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When he sent this message to Chitose, who always kept her smartphone close, he got<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a reply right away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        We're saying good-bye soon.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Feeling relieved that Chitose wasn't going to keep them out all night, Amane sent<p></p>
        <p></p>
        another message asking when they expected to get to the station. Then he stood up<p></p>
        <p></p>
        from the sofa and headed for the bathroom.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I think I have a little hair wax left over from the other day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He wasn't all that interested in styling his hair, but if he was planning to go meet<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru in public, it was the least he could do.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If he was being honest, getting dressed up was a huge pain, but Amane's parents had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        taught him how to make himself presentable. Surely he could reproduce the hairstyle<p></p>
        <p></p>
        from memory.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When he looked in the mirror, Amane saw his usual gloomy self staring back at him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He popped open the hair wax, confident that he could transform the uncouth,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        unfashionable youth standing before him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was the middle of winter, and on top of that, the sun had set, so the temperature had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dipped quite low.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After considering both warmth and fashion, Amane decided on a light-gray sweater<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and navy blue peacoat, paired with fleece-lined black skinny jeans, but even so, he was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        undeniably cold. He could only imagine how cold Mahiru must have felt in only her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        school uniform and jacket.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even though Mahiru wore thick tights during the winter, her uniform's skirt, its length<p></p>
        <p></p>
        determined by school regulations, still looked downright freezing to him. He wanted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to tell her it'd be better to wear sweatpants underneath it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Some of the girls he walked past were wearing even shorter skirts. Amane was keenly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        aware of the tremendous lengths some people would go to in pursuit of fashion.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As these thoughts bounced around in his mind, he nestled the lower half of his face in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the scarf he had received from Mahiru and hurried to the nearest station.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, the girls had taken the train to a big shopping complex. The station was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        within walking distance of Amane's apartment, and according to Chitose, the train<p></p>
        <p></p>
        should be arriving any moment, so he had probably shown up at just the right time.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Amane walked, his freshly styled hair was blown about a bit by the wind, but not<p></p>
        <p></p>
        badly enough to mess it up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If it had gotten too ruffled, of course he would have had to stop to fix it, however<p></p>
        <p></p>
        reluctant he might be. Amane was quickly gaining a newfound respect for anyone who<p></p>
        <p></p>
        strove to be fashionable every day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was walking silently, lost in his own thoughts, when the station came into view.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Considering the direction of the apartment complex, Mahiru should come out of this exit,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so if I wait nearby, I'm sure I'll see her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He leaned against the wall near the exit and waited, checking the time. Before long, a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        girl with familiar blond hair came out of the gates.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru!" he called out to her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Recognizing his voice, Mahiru turned to look—and the moment she laid eyes on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane, she practically froze.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah… what? Wh-why?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She was obviously surprised by his appearance. Chitose must have told her that he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was coming to meet her, but she clearly hadn't expected him to show up looking like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he had during their New Year's shrine visit.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        But Amane hadn't even entertained the idea of coming out with his usual sloppy<p></p>
        <p></p>
        appearance and normal hairdo. He would be in trouble if someone identified him as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the mystery man, so if he was going to accompany Mahiru in public, he needed to dress<p></p>
        <p></p>
        up a bit. He had to disguise himself, of course, but he also felt like he should look<p></p>
        <p></p>
        decent if he was going to be seen with her in public.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What, did you think I couldn't dress myself? I can't exactly come meet you at the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        station in my normal clothes, now can I?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I suppose not, but—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Does it look bad? I checked myself in the mirror, but maybe it's weird…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had chosen an ordinary, safe outfit and tried to style his hair like it had been on the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        day of the shrine visit, so Amane had hoped that he didn't look too strange. But now<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he realized that it probably looked all wrong to anybody with real taste.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He could feel people's gazes flicker over him from time to time, so there was a good<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chance that he did look weird after all. It was a bit of a shock to realize that he looked<p></p>
        <p></p>
        unfashionable despite trying his best.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        But Mahiru shook her head, appearing flustered. "It looks good," she reassured him,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and Amane felt himself breathe a sigh of relief.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm glad you think so. Look, it's already dark, right? It would be dangerous to walk<p></p>
        <p></p>
        home alone."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I kn-know that, but—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I guess you probably didn't want me to come meet you after all. Well, if you don't want<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to walk together, I can walk a little ways ahead, and you can just follow me, I guess…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I—I never said that. I, umm… really do appreciate it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Of course."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was happy to hear that she didn't object to him being there. He pulled a hand<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out of his pocket and offered it to her. Timidly, she pressed her palm into his. Maybe it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was because of the cold weather, but her hand felt much chillier than he expected.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So cold. What happened to your gloves?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I washed them, so they're still drying. And anyway, where are yours?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I just stuck my hands in my pockets."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He couldn't scold her too much, since he'd also forgotten to wear gloves, a lesson he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        should have learned as a child.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane didn't say anything further and simply kept her dainty hand nestled in his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        palm. It felt incredibly delicate compared to his.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…So warm…," Mahiru mumbled quietly, and her eyes twinkled happily as she smiled.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane felt his heart wrench when he saw her innocent expression, but he refused to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        let it show and kept his attention solely focused on her small hand in his as he casually<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slipped Mahiru's schoolbag, as well as several shopping bags she'd acquired on her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        outing, over his shoulder.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru glanced up at him but didn't say anything.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What is it?" he asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Abruptly, Mahiru turned away. Her ears and cheeks were slightly red, probably from<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the cold, he thought.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come on, let's go home. Do you want to stop at the convenience store on the way? The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pork buns are good this time of year."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm happy with a sweet bean bun."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You sure do like sweets… What are we doing about dinner?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I've marinated some eggs and prepared some char siu pork and bamboo shoots, so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        we're having ramen."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ramen is perfect on a cold day, huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yes, it is."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane hadn't looked in the refrigerator, so he was pleasantly surprised to hear the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        evening's menu. Sure, the soup and noodles would be prepackaged, but Mahiru had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        made the toppings by hand. Amane's mouth started to water as he imagined the thick<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slices of pork and perfectly seasoned soft-boiled eggs.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They were sure to hit the spot on a chilly winter evening.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I wonder if I'll be able to eat a whole bowl of ramen after a bean bun?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well then, how about you give me half? That way, you can probably finish both."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Okay."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        For some reason, Mahiru looked a little embarrassed, so Amane smiled slightly and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        squeezed her hand just a little.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shiina was spotted with another mystery man!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The following day, Itsuki shot him a hard look. "Not only are the rumors still spreading,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        somebody added fuel to the fire. What're ya gonna do, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane turned away sharply. "Hell if I know…"<p></p>
        <p></p>

        20 The Angel in Poor Health<p></p>
        It happened on a Friday, on one of the last days of January.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Hmm?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane returned to the living room after cleaning up dinner, but when he looked at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru, he noticed that her cheeks were unusually red.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At first, he thought that maybe the thermostat was set too high, but it was on the same<p></p>
        <p></p>
        temperature as always, and Mahiru wasn't wearing particularly warm clothing, either.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When he looked closely, he saw that her expression seemed distant and kind of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        unfocused. Her breathing was also shallower than usual. All signs pointed to her being<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sick.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When he took a moment to think about it, the weather had gotten much colder lately,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and Mahiru, as an honors student, had been busy helping her teacher with some big<p></p>
        <p></p>
        project. On top of that, she was doing her usual housework and making dinner for the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        two of them. It wasn't strange at all for her to fall ill with such a workload.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane admonished himself for not noticing her condition earlier. He regretted not<p></p>
        <p></p>
        paying more attention to her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru, your face is red. Do you think you have a fever?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Of course not."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru decisively dismissed Amane's concerns. Her expression was stiff, and she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shook her head, but she couldn't hide the redness in her cheeks.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Obviously, he couldn't just take her word for it, so even though he knew that it was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        rude to touch her without her permission, Amane gently placed the palm of his hand<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on Mahiru's forehead, which was usually hidden by her bangs.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As he had expected, her head was much hotter than his palm. Mahiru's typical body<p></p>
        <p></p>
        temperature wasn't that high compared to Amane's, so it was pretty clear she had a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fever.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're hot as the sun."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…No, I'm not."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, how about we take your temperature and confirm it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "There's no need. You're worrying over nothing."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her voice was thin and lacked her usual energy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, come on. I can tell by looking at you that you're running a fever."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm just a bit flushed."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If that's the case, then you'll need to take your temperature and prove it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane stood up and retrieved a thermometer from the first aid box on the shelf in the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        living room. He brought it back to Mahiru, but she turned her face away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She either didn't want to acknowledge her fever, or she insisted on bluffing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was probably one or the other, but Amane couldn't really proceed until she agreed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to have her temperature taken. He stood right in front of the uncooperative Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and placed the thermometer firmly in her hand.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru, either I can loosen your clothes and stick the thermometer in your armpit,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        or you can take your own temperature… Which do you prefer?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane put on a very serious face when he made this threat.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru let out a startled groan and turned her body toward the back of the sofa. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seemed like she had resigned herself to it, and he heard the sound of the thermometer<p></p>
        <p></p>
        turning on, so just to be safe, Amane also turned his back to Mahiru and waited for her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to finish.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Before long, he heard another electronic beep. Amane waited for Mahiru to put her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        clothes back in order. When he turned around, she was looking at him, expressionless,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        holding the thermometer in its case.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Thirty-seven point two degrees Celsius. A slight fever, all right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's only a little higher than usual, and I still feel totally fine, so…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane took the thermometer from Mahiru's hand and removed it from the case again.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The thermometer Amane had used was the type that recorded the previously measured<p></p>
        <p></p>
        temperature, and when he turned it on again—sure enough, it displayed a temperature<p></p>
        <p></p>
        more than one whole degree higher than Mahiru had reported.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh yeah? I see thirty-eight point four here."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She averted her eyes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Seriously, have you been running yourself ragged and letting me sit on my butt the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        whole time? You're taking all day tomorrow and tomorrow night off. No buts."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Amane caught a cold, Mahiru had put him to bed and had him change into<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pajamas and brought him rice porridge, but he wondered how she would fare doing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nothing when it was her turn.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had a relatively sturdy constitution, so he'd simply gone to sleep and woken<p></p>
        <p></p>
        up feeling better, but if Mahiru didn't rest and kept running around, she would never<p></p>
        <p></p>
        recover, even from something relatively minor. Mahiru was sick, and that meant no<p></p>
        <p></p>
        straining herself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        However, Mahiru was still avoiding his gaze. She didn't seem likely to agree to a strict<p></p>
        <p></p>
        regimen of bed rest.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …So stubborn… Well, I guess there's no other way, then.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane extended a hand to Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The fever was slowing her down, and it took her a moment to turn to him. Thinking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that it would be just perfect if she didn't resist, Amane put his arms around Mahiru's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        back and under her knees and lifted her off the sofa.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Carrying her like a child, so that she had to cling tightly to him, Amane checked that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he could hear the sound of jangling keys from Mahiru's pocket and headed for the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        door.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh, A-Amane…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to finally realize that she was being carried, and he heard her flustered<p></p>
        <p></p>
        voice coming from between his arms.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Amane stopped for a moment and looked down at her, Mahiru's cheeks were<p></p>
        <p></p>
        still red with fever, and she was peering up at him with confusion in her eyes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're definitely going to push yourself too hard, so I'm going to keep watch until you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fall asleep."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Y-you're going to barge into a girl's bedroom?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If you don't like that idea, you can sleep in my room."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…And the option for you to leave me alone…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That ship sailed when you refused to rest."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even Amane knew that no matter how close of a friend he was, going into a girl's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apartment, and what's more, into her bedroom, and standing guard until she fell<p></p>
        <p></p>
        asleep, would be a serious invasion of her privacy. It was definitely not something he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would ever even consider under normal circumstances. But after seeing the way she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was acting, he was seriously worried for her health. He just knew that Mahiru would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        run herself into the ground if he didn't do something. As far as he was concerned, there<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wasn't any other option.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Long ago, Mahiru had forced her way into his apartment, so he figured that just this<p></p>
        <p></p>
        once, he would employ the same forceful measures for her sake.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Okay, which do you prefer? My house or yours?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…And if I say I don't like either?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If you say that, then we default to barging into your apartment so I can toss you into<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bed."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Your room is fine…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, Mahiru didn't want Amane bursting into her bedroom, so she finally<p></p>
        <p></p>
        relented and agreed to rest in Amane's room instead.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane exhaled hard—neither a sigh nor a breath of relief. I understand why she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wouldn't want to let a boy into her room, he thought as he carried her to his bed. And I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        know she didn't make a huge fuss, either. But if she was going to be so stubborn about it,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I wish she would have just stayed home and rested up in the first place.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru hadn't been in Amane's bedroom since New Year's.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        For the moment, he lowered Mahiru onto the bed, then started fishing through his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dresser drawers. He figured it would be best if she changed into something she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wouldn't have to worry about getting sweat on before going to sleep. He chose the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smallest shirt and sweatpants he had, then set them down by Mahiru's side.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Here. Change into these."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…But—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Or I can strip you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'll get changed…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru reluctantly picked up the change of clothes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was not at all prepared to carry out his threat, and he didn't think Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would have let him anyway. Just thinking about it made him want to die of shame. He<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was thoroughly relieved to hear that she would play along.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Since he wasn't about to stay and watch her change, Amane quickly left the room and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        retrieved some sports drinks from his pantry shelf.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After Amane had recovered from his cold the previous year, he had stocked up on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        prepackaged rice porridge, extra sports drinks, and cooling sheets. His preparations<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were finally paying off.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Carrying the supplies, along with a towel and some medicine, Amane knocked on the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        door of his own bedroom and heard a small voice reply, "I've finished changing."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He entered and saw Mahiru looking at him, propped up on his bed, wearing his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        clothes. As expected, even the smallest clothes he had were too large on Mahiru—<p></p>
        <p></p>
        baggy was probably the most accurate word.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She looked adorable, dressed in clothes that were the wrong size, but Amane drove<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that thought from his mind and set down the sports drinks and towel on the table<p></p>
        <p></p>
        beside the bed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Will you take some medicine? It's over-the-counter stuff."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Sure. I have the same type at home, so I think it's all right."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Okay."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He went back to the kitchen for a moment and filled a cup with water. While he was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        there, he fished an ice pack out of the freezer. He recalled the saying "Preparation is<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the key to success" and smiled to himself about how true that was turning out to be.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane hurried back to the bedroom and handed the water to Mahiru, then took some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pills out of the packaging and put them in her open palm.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Take those and drink plenty of water. Then get to sleep."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        While Mahiru was swallowing the medicine, he wrapped the ice pack in the towel and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        set it beside her pillow. As he did, he heard Mahiru mumble "…You're pretty well<p></p>
        <p></p>
        prepared."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm just doing everything you did for me, you know."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Basically, he was just repeating exactly what Mahiru had done when she nursed him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        back to health. He was healthy now, so it was only natural that he should return the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        favor.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "By the way, why were you trying to push yourself so hard?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Because I'm incapable of effective self-management."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Look, you have to draw the line somewhere. You're always running around, working<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hard, and your body is probably all worn out. Come to think of it, I guess I owe you an<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apology for my part in keeping you so busy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Making his dinner every night had undoubtedly placed an extra burden on Mahiru that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she clearly didn't need. She had her own life to deal with, and here she was taking care<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of him. It was inexcusable, really.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's fever seemed to be connected to her fatigue, so Amane wanted to care of her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the best he could and let her rest.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I've never thought of you as a burden, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Really…? Well, even if that's true, think of this as a good opportunity for you to take it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        easy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was happy to hear her say that she didn't find the time they spent together to be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        taxing, but he still felt guilty about how much attention she had paid to his needs. This<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was his chance to tend to Mahiru while she got some rest. It would probably actually<p></p>
        <p></p>
        be better to send her home, but Amane wanted to stay by her side. He knew he would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        never forgive himself if anything happened to her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru hesitated but eventually agreed to lie down.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She buried everything up to her neck under the comforter, then glanced at Amane. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looked slightly embarrassed, probably because she didn't like having someone standing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        over her while she slept. Amane was about to leave her alone, thinking that he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shouldn't stare at girls in their sleep, when he felt something tug at his sleeve. When<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he looked down, he found Mahiru's small hand grasping at his shirt.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was also staring at her hand, caramel-coloured eyes wide with shock. She looked<p></p>
        <p></p>
        just as surprised as he did. A moment passed, and then she quickly released him and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        buried herself completely under the comforter, pulling it all the way up over her face<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to hide.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Good night," came a feeble mumble from Mahiru, cocooned in the blanket.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane scratched his cheek, unsure what to do.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …She gets really anxious when she's not feeling well, huh?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Figuring she would probably forgive him, he turned back the comforter a little bit,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        until he found Mahiru's hand and grabbed hold of it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He squeezed it gently, and Mahiru stuck her face out from under the comforter, wearing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a troubled expression. But Amane had a feeling that was more from embarrassment<p></p>
        <p></p>
        than anger.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm not a child, you know."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I know. I'll just be here keeping watch so that you won't run away, so don't mind me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm not running away this late in the game."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I wonder. Well, I'll get out of here once you're asleep, so you can relax. Come on, if you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        want me to leave, hurry up and fall asleep."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was being very direct. But it worked. Mahiru meekly snuggled back down<p></p>
        <p></p>
        under the comforter, and he felt her squeeze his hand back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He felt sort of happy, and embarrassed, and for some reason, agitated. It was like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        someone was tickling the inside of his chest.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane kept hold of her slender fingers until he heard her peaceful sleeping breaths.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The following morning, Amane woke up on the sofa and checked the clock as he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stretched his stiff body.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was just past eight in the morning. It wasn't a school day, and he almost never got<p></p>
        <p></p>
        up this early on the weekends, but Amane wanted to see how Mahiru was doing, so he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        decided he'd better get a move on. He had peeked in on her just in case during the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        night and confirmed that she looked like she was sleeping peacefully, but he couldn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tell what her true condition was.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He stood up and stretched, then quietly headed toward his own bedroom and opened<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the door without making a sound.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He hadn't knocked in case Mahiru was still sleeping, but when he opened the door, she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sat up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her cheeks were still slightly red, but not as red as the night before, and although her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expression was slack and somewhat bleary, her eyes focused when she spotted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Morning. How are you feeling? The truth, please."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm still sluggish."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Gotcha. I'm going to the convenience store to buy breakfast and something that you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        might be able to eat."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He did have that rice porridge, but he had the image that sick people ate meal<p></p>
        <p></p>
        supplement jelly and canned peaches and thought those might be easier to eat, so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that's what he was planning to get.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was relieved to find that she seemed to be doing better than expected, and he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pulled another change of clothes out of the dresser and set them on the bed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm leaving you a change of clothes here. Make sure you take your temperature, too.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If you want to wipe off the sweat, go ahead and use the water in that wash basin and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        this towel."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Before leaving the room, Amane pointed to the basin he had used to wipe the sweat<p></p>
        <p></p>
        from her face during the night.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Then he retrieved his wallet and left the apartment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Walking at a leisurely pace, Amane made sure that Mahiru would have plenty of time<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to wipe herself off and change her clothes, even if her fever slowed her down. The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        convenience store was located quite close to their apartment building, so he could<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have made the trip in just a few minutes, but he was careful and took his time shopping.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane returned home after spending a solid twenty minutes out of the house and put<p></p>
        <p></p>
        away the cold items in the refrigerator. When he finally went in to see Mahiru, she had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        finished changing and was waiting for him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She also seemed more alert and already looked healthier than the day before. She was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smiling faintly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Any fever?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thirty-seven point five degrees."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm, still slightly high… Don't move around too much."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I kn-know that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Do you have an appetite? I've got some rice porridge here, and I also bought pudding<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and jelly."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He knew he shouldn't let her eat anything too heavy, so he had brought back things<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that were easy to eat and soft, but what she ate would depend on Mahiru's appetite.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, sorry you went to the—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't apologize. You did the same thing for me. So pudding or jelly, which do you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        want?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Jelly."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Here ya go. Do you think you can eat some rice porridge as well?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Yes."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, I'll heat it up; so you sit tight."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane shuffled out of the room. He was concerned about Mahiru. She seemed anxious.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane placed a pouch of rice porridge in some hot water to warm it up, then poured<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it into a bowl.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If he was really going to repay Mahiru for what she did last time, he probably should<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have made the porridge by hand, but he honestly wasn't sure he would have been able<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to pull it off without messing up something, so he'd decided to fall back on the reliable<p></p>
        <p></p>
        instant pouches.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was sure it would be nothing next to Mahiru's homemade porridge, but Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        figured the most important thing was that she had something, anything, to eat.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Here. Think you can manage to eat on your own?" Amane asked her jokingly as he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        held out a spoon and waited for her to take the bowl of porridge.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru scowled at him sullenly. "Are you making fun of me? And what if I said I can't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        eat on my own—I suppose you'd offer to feed me?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, I mean… I'll feed you if you want, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's face went red, as if her fever had made a sudden comeback.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I-I'll eat by myself."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Y-yeah."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She accepted the bowl from Amane and started taking small bites, but the redness did<p></p>
        <p></p>
        not disappear by the time she was done eating.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She seemed to still have some appetite after finishing the porridge, so she opened the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        jelly next. Once she put that away as well, she sighed. She looked much better now, so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        all that was left was to get some rest so she could regain her strength. Amane was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        rather relieved.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is there anything else you want me to do?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Nothing for now."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Amane stood up to leave, thinking that he should probably just let her rest more,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru slowly looked up at him, as if making some sort of request. Her gaze was steady<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and direct.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Sensing the fear and anxiety lurking behind her caramel-coloured eyes, Amane sat<p></p>
        <p></p>
        down right next to Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's nothing."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If he told her up front that she seemed lonely, Mahiru would probably deny it outright<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and chase him away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        So Amane sat quietly by the bedside and simply looked over at Mahiru, who was sitting<p></p>
        <p></p>
        up in bed. "I'm not busy right now anyway. How about we just chat until you get a little<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sleepy?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Okay." She nodded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He smiled at her as he leaned against the bed, and Mahiru also smiled faintly as if<p></p>
        <p></p>
        reassured.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…This is the first time someone's ever really taken care of me when I'm sick… Even<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Miss Koyuki went home when her shift was over."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Miss Koyuki?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "The maid who worked for us when I was at home."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, the person who taught you how to cook?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I was always alone in the mornings and evenings, so…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I'm here now. Besides, I'll be in a serious pinch if you don't hurry up and get<p></p>
        <p></p>
        well."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm sorry for using your bed. And about dinner…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's not what I meant. It's awful, you know? I just want to see my friend get better."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even though they had only known each other a relatively short while, after all the time<p></p>
        <p></p>
        they'd spent together, it was only natural for Amane to worry about her. Even if she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hadn't been running herself ragged taking care of him among other things, Amane still<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would have worried about her. She was his friend, after all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And besides, I'm not the type of person who celebrates when someone else gets sick."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I know that already. You're a nice person, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yes, ma'am."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was a little embarrassed and felt awkward being told directly to his face that he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was nice.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Go ahead and get some rest… You'll feel better if you sleep as much as you need."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Okay."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shall I stand guard until you drift off again?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane made a joke to hide his embarrassment, but Mahiru blinked in surprise.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Yes, please do."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You suggested it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I did, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He never imagined that she would accept. He had expected Mahiru to glow bright red<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and immediately reject the idea. His eyes went wide in surprise, and now Mahiru was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the one wearing an impish smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Or does a man go back on his word?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Absolutely not. Time to lie down," Amane muttered quietly. Then he added "You win<p></p>
        <p></p>
        this round" as he squeezed Mahiru's hand.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She slipped under the covers. Then she looked at her hand resting in Amane's, and her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expression softened.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…It's so warm."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Your fever must have gone down a lot, if you've cooled off… All right, get some sleep."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Okay."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She squeezed his hand once in return. She looked like she was relieved that he was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        there after all. Slowly, her eyes drifted closed, and before long, Amane could hear the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        regular rhythm of her sleeping breath.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …You dummy, he groaned, covering his face with his other hand.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Whenever the two of them touched like this, Amane lost his cool. His heart was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pounding in his ears, and his face felt so hot that, for a moment, he wondered if<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's fever had jumped hosts. Amane was so flushed that he almost forgot which<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of them was supposed to have the fever.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …This girl is really bad for my heart.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane glanced over at Mahiru and saw her sleeping peacefully, entirely relaxed and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        blissfully ignorant of Amane's woes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane swore under his breath and buried his face in the bedsheets.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was his bed, but it had a sweet scent, a little different from his own.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Amane came to, Mahiru's warmth had disappeared.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The hand he had been holding was gone, leaving Amane facedown in the bed, all alone.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He looked around the room in alarm, but Mahiru was obviously not in bed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane looked at the clock on the side table, saw that it was two, and then realized<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that he had crashed. He thought maybe it was because he had gotten up to check on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru during the night, but even so, Amane had never intended to sleep for so long.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Flustered, Amane stood up and headed for the living room.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He moved briskly, and it wasn't long before he saw Mahiru sitting with good posture on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the living room sofa. She wasn't dressed in his shirt and sweatpants anymore, but in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her own clothing, which likely meant that she'd gone home for a bit before returning.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane, good morning."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Morning. You weren't there when I woke up, so I panicked a little."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry. I took a quick shower and came back."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That must have been why she had changed clothes. Feeling relieved that she was well<p></p>
        <p></p>
        enough to bathe, he pressed his palm against Mahiru's forehead just in case, but she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was already back to her usual temperature.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm, seems like your fever broke. That's great."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm sorry for worrying you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You should be. Next time I'm going to do the same exact thing if you're not honest<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He said this as he was taking a seat next to Mahiru, and she frowned uneasily.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'll be careful, but… Amane, won't you be angry if I cause you trouble again?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Trouble?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Because you had to nurse me and everything…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "As if I'd ever consider any of that trouble, you dummy. Do I honestly seem that heartless<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Not at all. It's just… I was only wondering if it's all right to rely on you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You should rely on people for whatever you can. You're definitely the type who tries<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to take everything upon yourself even when you don't need to."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They had only been together for a few months, but even so, Amane thought he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        understood Mahiru's temperament pretty well.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She fundamentally didn't like to rely on other people, and she bottled up all her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        feelings deep inside and tried to never let them show. She seemed like she shut herself<p></p>
        <p></p>
        off from other people by building a wall that she didn't want anyone to slip behind.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, I know that I'm not very trustworthy, and you can't rely on me, but—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Th-that's not true! I trust you a lot, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Good. Then don't force yourself and let me help you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Without thinking, he reached out and ruffled Mahiru's hair, only after which he noticed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that Mahiru had gone completely still.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry. You hate that, don't you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Not exactly, no…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru shook her head slowly, not to disentangle his hand from her hair, but to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        disagree with his statement, then leaned her forehead against his upper arm.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        His heart leaped in his chest when he felt the slight weight of her body pressing against<p></p>
