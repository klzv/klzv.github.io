        I see, he thought. So the reason why she didn't act any differently, even though it's her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        birthday, wasn't because she forgot… She's been purposely ignoring it. Something about<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it must bother her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane figured that if that wasn't the case, Mahiru wouldn't have spoken like that.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Okay then, call it an expression of gratitude for everything you do for me. I just<p></p>
        <p></p>
        decided to give you something to repay you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Setting aside any mention of Mahiru's birthday, Amane pressed the bag on her,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        justifying it as his way of thanking her for her daily kindnesses. She cooked delicious<p></p>
        <p></p>
        meals for him every evening and helped him with his cleaning sometimes. When it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        came down to it, Mahiru did a lot to take care of Amane. He wanted to repay that debt<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in whatever small way possible.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane held out the present to Mahiru, but she shrank away. First, she looked confused,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        then she frowned at Amane's determination. Finally, she accepted the gift bag.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Well, can I open it?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru nodded and gingerly pulled out the box that was inside the paper bag, then<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she carefully untied the ribbon and removed the wrapping paper.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Something about watching Mahiru open the gift made Amane extremely nervous.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Inside the box was the hand cream Itsuki had suggested. It was nestled in a largish box<p></p>
        <p></p>
        alongside some sweets. Apparently, it'd been some kind of set. It wasn't the kind of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hand cream that smelled particularly nice, nor was it all that stylish. Instead, it was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the scentless kind that was gentle on the skin. That way, it wouldn't cause any trouble<p></p>
        <p></p>
        while doing housework. This was the sort that was advertised as moisture-retaining.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had made sure to check the reviews of the product on the Internet, so he was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        certain of its efficacy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, sorry it's nothing too crazy. I just thought that since you do a lot of housework,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        your hands might get dry. They had scented ones, too, but I thought you might have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some of those already. Apparently, it's effective and easy on the skin."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It is… quite practical," Mahiru said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I thought you would value practicality over anything else," answered Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, you're right. Thank you very much." Mahiru smiled slightly, as if she understood<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's reasoning. A little less nervous now, Amane's expression softened a bit as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        well. It seemed like he'd made a good impression.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was one more present, though, and Amane felt embarrassed to have Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        open this one in front of him for some reason. He'd hoped that she would only notice<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it after she had gone back home.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        However, Mahiru was peering into the paper bag, looking as if she had already noticed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that there was one more thing hiding within it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…What, a second one?" she asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah. Yeah, there is. It's a bonus; I picked it out myself," Amane answered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What does that mean?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Exactly what I said."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane averted his eyes. Mahiru tilted her head in confusion for an instant, then<p></p>
        <p></p>
        promptly pulled the second gift from the bag.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        To purposefully disguise this other present, Amane had intentionally wrapped it in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        paper the same color as the interior of the bag. He'd hoped that would make it stand<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out less—and that Mahiru would only notice it later when he wasn't around.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Unfortunately, it was large enough that Amane should've known it would be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        impossible to miss. There was honestly no way Mahiru could have overlooked it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Unlike the hand cream, this present didn't come in a box, just a polyester bag. It was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        just about the right size to fit comfortably in Mahiru's arms. The bag was tied up with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a navy-blue ribbon, and Amane watched Mahiru undo that carefully as well,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wondering if it would be all right for him to stand up from his seat. Finally, Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        carefully pulled out what lay inside.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She held the bag's contents up gently with both hands, blinking her large eyes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dramatically, looking truly surprised.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…A bear?" Mahiru mumbled.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was a stuffed animal. Not too large, it was perfectly proportioned for an elementary<p></p>
        <p></p>
        school student. Its light-colored fur was soft, much like Mahiru's own hair. A light-blue<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ribbon was tied around the toy's neck to form a collar. It had a rather cherubic look<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stitched onto its face, and the round, cute button eyes had a luster to them that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        reflected Mahiru's face as they stared at her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Doubtless, the girl was wondering why Amane had given her such a thing when she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was in high school. The truth was that Amane had taken a risk and chosen it based on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose's advice that girls liked cute things no matter how old they were.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Of course, he had been much too embarrassed to go buy the bear alone, so Chitose had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        come with him to make the purchase, though only in exchange for the deluxe crepe<p></p>
        <p></p>
        from the shop in front of the station.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose's smiling face had loomed over Amane throughout the whole process of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        buying the bear and getting it wrapped. In the end, he couldn't help but think it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        might've been better if he'd just gone alone. Though, there was nothing he could do<p></p>
        <p></p>
        about it now.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I thought it looked like something a girl would like," Amane mumbled to no one in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        particular, scratching his head. He was terrible at stuff like this.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The last time he'd gotten a present for a member of the opposite sex was when he'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        given gifts to his mother as a little kid. Amane had never once thought he'd have to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pick something out for a girl.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        So it doesn't faze her to get a cute stuffed animal from a boy, huh…?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Risking a quick glance at Mahiru, Amane saw her staring directly into the bear's face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He couldn't tell from her expression whether she was happy, only that her eyes were<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fixed on the stuffed animal.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean… If you don't like it, you can just toss it," Amane said, hoping to diffuse the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        situation with some light humor.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru turned sharply toward him and drew her eyebrows tightly into a frown. "I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would never!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "S-sure, I, uh, didn't think you would or anything."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The response had been so absolute that Amane couldn't help but flinch and barely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        managed to nod in answer. Mahiru looked back at the bear in her hands again.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I would never do such a cruel thing. I'll treasure it." Slender arms embraced the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stuffed bear, as if to wrap it up entirely. Amane couldn't decide if Mahiru looked more<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like a child with a favorite toy or a mother protecting an infant. Either way, she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        certainly embraced the bear enthusiastically, looking down at the thing as though it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were the most precious object in the world.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's face was not the stony mask she kept up at school, nor was it the face she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        often wore when she was exasperated with Amane. This time it was peaceful, soft, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        somewhat affectionate—an unmistakably sweet expression.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane felt an innocence in her, and her pure smile was beautiful enough to take his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        breath away. She was really exceptionally cute.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I shouldn't be staring, Amane thought. Mahiru was liable to notice if he kept looking at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her like that.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was certain that he wasn't in love, but seeing a beautiful girl make a face like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that, and knowing that he was the cause of it, undeniably made his heart throb. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looked so adorable as she sat there with a faint smile, hugging the stuffed animal to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her chest. Anyone who saw her would've been captivated by the sight. Amane certainly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was, despite his usual reservations.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Just pressing a palm to her face would've made it immediately apparent how much<p></p>
        <p></p>
        warmer it was than usual. Embarrassed after being so open with her emotions, she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        swore under her breath. "…Damn." The word was so quiet it could barely be heard.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Fortunately, Mahiru did not seem to have noticed how Amane was looking at her,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        because her face was half-buried in the stuffed animal that she was clutching to her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chest.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She still looked extremely sweet, and Amane was worried he would say something<p></p>
        <p></p>
        strange in spite of himself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm really glad you like it." Thankfully, Amane managed to keep what he said brief.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Quickly, Mahiru turned to face him. "This is the first time I've ever received something<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like this."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh? With how popular you are, I thought you'd be getting presents like this all the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        time…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What do you take me for…?" It came as a relief to see Mahiru's usual behavior return,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but that was only because Amane couldn't see her current expression behind the bear.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I never told anyone when my birthday was," Mahiru continued, looking back down<p></p>
        <p></p>
        at the stuffed animal. "I hate that day, so I don't really share it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's expression softened as she looked at her gift, though her words remained<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sharp. The apparent dissonance set Amane on edge a bit.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Normally, I hate getting presents from strangers, so I don't accept them," Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're accepting this, though," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Fujimiya…," Mahiru said quietly, "you're not a stranger."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Face still half-buried in fur, Mahiru looked up toward Amane again. She wore a dreamy,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        innocent expression. It was captivating, and as Amane gazed at the angel sitting on his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        couch, he realized he was in trouble.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was so cute that Amane found himself reaching unbidden to stroke her hair,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and he had to quickly stuff his hand behind his back before he did something really<p></p>
        <p></p>
        awkward.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        …That was close! If Amane had let his guard down, he probably would've started<p></p>
        <p></p>
        patting Mahiru on the head right then and there. Doing something so inappropriate<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would have destroyed everything he'd built with her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…What is it?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "N-nothing," Amane replied shyly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Perhaps Mahiru had seen his arm move, or maybe she'd noticed his obvious distress<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as he struggled to keep his alarming feelings from bubbling to the surface. Mahiru's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        head tilted to one side in puzzlement. That simple movement was enough to leave<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane speechless, and it occurred to him that beautiful girls possessed a terrifying<p></p>
        <p></p>
        power. Still, he felt embarrassed for being so captivated by Mahiru's cuteness. He was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        also confident that if he told her how he felt, she would just be confused.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Something about the feeling instilled a sense of danger in Amane, and he did his best<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to push it deep down.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Thank you very much, Fujimiya," Mahiru said in a soft voice, but Amane had already<p></p>
        <p></p>
        turned away from her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, hey, Amane, how'd it go with that girl you got the present for?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Obviously Chitose was going to pry, since Amane had convinced her to come along<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shopping with him. The day after Mahiru's birthday, Amane was confronted by<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose's grinning inquiry.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose was in a different class but had come to his classroom after school. That alone<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wasn't much of an issue, but hers was the sort of smile that made Amane feel like she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was up to something. Today especially, he felt the urge to turn and run.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nothing happened—at least, not anything like you're imagining," Amane answered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was the truth. He definitely wasn't holding on to any amorous feelings, and he hadn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        given Mahiru the present because he hoped it would lead to the start of something<p></p>
        <p></p>
        more. Sure, she'd graciously accepted the gifts, but there had certainly been no<p></p>
        <p></p>
        romantic developments of the kind that Chitose anticipated.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Now hold on," Itsuki interrupted, "The fact that you were so concerned about<p></p>
        <p></p>
        someone at all is a pretty rare thing, you know. You suddenly have some acquaintance<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that you seem involved with, and it's a girl. Very suspicious."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's nothing like that." Amane knew he had to shut this down now. He was happy that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had been pleased with her gifts, but he was starting to think that bringing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        other people into the situation was more trouble than it'd been worth.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Not wanting to feed their curiosity anymore, Amane had answered as bluntly as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        possible, but Itsuki had his hand to his mouth, as if he was pondering something.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Hmm… say, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What is it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is it possible that the person you gave the present to is… your neighbor?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki was smart and very perceptive, which at times like these could be a real pain.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…What makes you think that?" Amane asked nervously.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, she's the only person I could think of that bothers taking care of you. And you're<p></p>
        <p></p>
        not from around here, so you don't know many people. Plus, you don't hang out with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        many girls. She brought you dinner that other day, right? I was thinking that maybe<p></p>
        <p></p>
        this was about you wanting to return the favor."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm… Amane has been looking very healthy recently, right, Chi?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, I thought so, too."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "She must be bringing him meals pretty frequently, huh? I wonder if that's why he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wanted to give her a birthday present, to thank her?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane fought to maintain a blank expression as Itsuki perfectly described the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        situation to Chitose. It was so accurate that it was like he had been there to watch it all<p></p>
        <p></p>
        go down. Sometimes Itsuki was scary like that. Amane could see why his friend was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so popular. He was a bit of a show-off but also smart and thoughtful. Amane just<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wished Itsuki would save the grandstanding for his girlfriend.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What an overactive imagination…," Amane interjected.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, you won't fess up, so imaginations are all we've got. C'mon, spill it!" Itsuki pressed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Who knows…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're holdin' out on us!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So stingy!" Chitose chimed in agreement.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shut up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        No matter what anyone said, Amane wasn't planning on confirming the truth. If he let<p></p>
        <p></p>
        anything slip, Itsuki and Chitose would never stop hounding him until he'd spit out<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the whole story. Really, Itsuki was only the tip of the iceberg; Amane was in the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        presence of a high school girl who loved gossip, especially when it came to romantic<p></p>
        <p></p>
        affairs. While there wasn't the slightest bit of romance to be found here, if Chitose got<p></p>
        <p></p>
        one whiff of the person involved, Amane would never hear the end of it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Sighing in exasperation, Amane finished packing his things and shouldered his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        backpack. He'd decided on a strategic retreat, before his two friends gave him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        heartburn.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "See ya. You two can go ahead and flirt all you like in private," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "We were gonna do that whether you said to or not!" Itsuki shouted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Itsuki, weren't we gonna tail him and try to meet the girl in question…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, uh, you probably shouldn't discuss your operation in front of the target… And<p></p>
        <p></p>
        anyway, there's nothing to see. Even if there was, you two would never make it past<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the lobby!" Amane scolded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Tch!" Chitose's lips curled into a cute pout, but her eyes were serious. Apparently, she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        really had been planning on tailing Amane. Nervously hurrying out of the room,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane left his friends behind.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…That was a close one," Amane grumbled without thinking.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What was?" Mahiru asked him curiously.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was still a little early to make dinner, but Amane and Mahiru had gone shopping and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        come back to his apartment. They'd been relaxing for a bit, when Mahiru overheard<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane talking to himself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had been acting the same as usual; there was no trace of the girl who'd been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so enamored with the stuffed bear. The same placid expression remained, and Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wondered if perhaps he'd dreamed up the whole birthday incident. Actually, he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        preferred her this way. He wasn't sure his heart could stand regularly seeing her look<p></p>
        <p></p>
        at him the way she had the other day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, well, Itsuki and Chitose were suspicious about the present."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane intended to explain that he'd consulted them about the present, but Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seemed to remember Itsuki's name, and she exhaled, saying "Ah, I see" as if she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        understood.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, it didn't seem like the sort of thing you would buy on your own."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's not what I was concerned about…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, no one thought Amane was capable of getting a gift for a girl. If he was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        being honest, he really didn't think he'd ever experience the many sweet and bitter<p></p>
        <p></p>
        feelings that were supposed to accompany love all at once.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "My shopping is my business. Why does everyone think that way about me anyway?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Certainly, Mahiru was cute, and yesterday he'd felt a desire to reach out and touch her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That much he couldn't deny, but what young man wouldn't have felt that way? Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was outrageously beautiful, after all. Amane had been caught up in her beauty; that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was all. Nothing about what had happened was evidence he had any deeper feelings.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was a great person, but Amane was not interested in her like that.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He glanced over at Mahiru. She was just as beautiful as ever, but Amane's heart didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pound like it had the night before. Once again, he reminded himself that he didn't care<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for Mahiru in any meaningful way.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Worried that Mahiru would say something if she caught Amane staring at her, he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looked down at his phone instead. When he did, he realized he'd received a ton of new<p></p>
        <p></p>
        texts. Thinking it was probably Itsuki, Amane decided to check them, but it turned out<p></p>
        <p></p>
        they hadn't come from his friend.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane frowned at the sender's name: SHIHOKO.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She was one of only three female contacts in Amane's phone. There was Chitose,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru, and… Amane's mother.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Wondering what she could possibly want, Amane tapped the message thread. He<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hated dealing with his mother's high-strung questions, always asking him how exams<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were going or whether he needed anything. He could barely handle Chitose, and yet<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some members of his family were just like her. In fact, Chitose might become very<p></p>
        <p></p>
        much like Amane's mother as she got older. Shihoko wasn't so bad that Amane outright<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hated her, but he couldn't stand his mother's personality.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I brought some fruit back from Grandfather's, so I'm going to share it with you, Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I'm sending it over, so be at your place on Saturday afternoon! I won't forgive you if you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        refuse delivery or aren't there to get it, okay?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So you can just decide my plans all on your own…?" Amane muttered. Now, he didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        actually have any plans for Saturday, but he thought his mother ought to have at least<p></p>
        <p></p>
        contacted him a little earlier.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Did something happen?" Mahiru must have heard Amane's whisperings, because she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looked over at him with her usual calm expression.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "My mom picked some fruit at my grandpa's place, and she's sending it here on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Saturday afternoon. Probably apples and stuff," Amane explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Do you peel your apples?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I guess I could do that, with a peeler."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That would peel them, but… it'll take off a lot of the flesh, too, so it's a little wasteful."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's words sounded like something Amane's mother would say, and he tried to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        swallow that thought before it surfaced.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If it comes down to it, we can just eat them whole," he said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How savage."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's a pain to peel them." Amane shrugged and grinned haplessly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're such a mess." Despite Mahiru sounding annoyed and giving a rather brutal<p></p>
        <p></p>
        assessment of Amane's table manners, the way she held herself also showed some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        understanding. "I guess it's all the same once you eat them."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You know, I'm not sure I'll be able to eat them all before they go bad. Do you want<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some, too?" asked Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sure, I'd be happy to take some. Fruit is expensive, after all." It was kind of a domestic<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thing to say, but then again, that was the kind of person Mahiru was.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Saturday, right? In that case, I'll make us lunch beforehand as thanks," Mahiru said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But you're always taking care of me already," Amane protested.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Like I've told you, I really don't mind making food for you, Fujimiya." Mahiru smiled<p></p>
        <p></p>
        very slightly. Somehow, the little grin made Amane feel awkward. It called to mind the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        events of the previous day, and Amane couldn't help but avert his eyes from the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        beautiful angel in his apartment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…All right, thanks," he replied curtly.<p></p>
        <p></p>


        <H2>10 – Mother Invades</H2>
        Asking Mahiru to pick up her portion of the fruit as soon as the package arrived turned<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out to be a big mistake. When Amane heard the sound of the intercom and the high-pitched,
        <p></p>
        mischievous voice that called "Aaa-maaa-neee!" through it, he understood<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that he was in trouble.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had been very grateful for Mahiru's proposal to make lunch for him on Saturday.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It had seemed a veritable blessing from heaven at the time. Truly, the carbonara she'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        whipped up had been delicious. The thick-bodied sauce and the kick of black pepper<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were a perfect match, and it'd been tremendously tasty.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru hadn't done anything wrong. Those at fault were Amane himself for failing to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        recognize in advance what his mother had meant by telling him to be home on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Saturday for the delivery and that irksome, surprise-loving woman herself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Um, Fujimiya? Is that the delivery…?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nope. That would be my mother. She's probably using her duplicate key to get<p></p>
        <p></p>
        through the front door and is heading up right now," Amane explained. Thinking back<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on it, it had been his own mistake to take what his mother had said at face value. One<p></p>
        <p></p>
        way or another, she always created situations that allowed her to come by and check<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in on him. Amane's mother could never resist employing a little misdirection.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Uh, your mother?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "She probably came to see whether I'm getting along okay… and she didn't tell me she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was coming. Probably because she knew I would clean up in advance."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh-huh…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I know it's all a bit hard to swallow, but that doesn't matter right now."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Right now, the problem was what to do with Mahiru. If Amane's mother had still been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in the lobby downstairs, he could have sent Mahiru home, but that was out of the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        question now that she was approaching his door. At the same time, his mother was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sure to get the wrong idea if he invited her into his apartment and she came across<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru. There was no doubting that Mahiru would hate that as much as Amane would.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The longer Amane puzzled over what to do, the closer his mother was getting to just<p></p>
        <p></p>
        barging right in.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I can't believe this is happening… Amane did have an idea, but he didn't like it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm sorry, Shiina, but could you please hide in my bedroom?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh, wh-what?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Take your stuff with you, and once I find some way to get my mom outside, you can<p></p>
        <p></p>
        go back home. I'm really sorry, but please?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With no other viable option, Amane took the helm and steered Mahiru into concealing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        herself. Thankfully, they'd already finished cleaning up after lunch, so that wouldn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        be a giveaway. If he hid her shoes in the shoe closet, they wouldn't be discovered, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru could just bring her personal effects into Amane's room.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The plan was to let Amane's mom to make a quick inspection of the apartment while<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was hiding. Amane would mention to his mother that he really wanted to eat<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her home cooking, something that'd probably keep her too busy to push her way into<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his room.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Whatever it took, Amane had to keep his mother from breaching the bedroom.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He would purposely request that his mother cook something that used an ingredient<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he didn't have in his refrigerator. If the two of them went out shopping together, that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would provide Mahiru with a window to escape.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane hurriedly explained to Mahiru that such a scheme was the only option as he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        handed her his extra key and asked her to cooperate with the greatest sincerity he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        could muster.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "O-okay," she said, nodding in bewilderment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In truth, the storage room was also an option, but Amane didn't want a girl to wait in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        there. It had no heating, which meant it was quite cold this time of year. Amane's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bedroom had a proper heater, as well as soft cushions. It wouldn't do to have Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sitting on a bare floor while she shivered from the cold.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…All right, I'm counting on you. I have to deal with my mom, so…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even before meeting his mother, Amane looked dejected. He headed for the entrance<p></p>
        <p></p>
        while Mahiru quietly slipped into the bedroom. After making sure that the angel was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hidden, Amane reluctantly opened the front door.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "My goodness Amane, that took you long enough. I'm glad to see you're looking well. I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was starting to wonder if you were asleep."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was Amane's mother, standing just outside his apartment. He hadn't seen her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        since summer break.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Although she was a parent, it would have been difficult to tell from her looks alone. It<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wasn't just that her face looked young, she never acted her age, either. She wore the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        same sort of happy expression she often had back when Amane was still living at home.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, yeah, I'm perfectly fine, so how about heading home?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How can you say that to your own mother? It took me several hours to get here, you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        know? Don't I even get a thank-you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thank you very much for traveling a great distance, now please go home."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come now, don't say such things. It's not very endearing. You should act more like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shuuto, your father!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Men don't need to be endearing, do we?" While Amane had spat his words acidly, his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mother, Shihoko, didn't seem bothered at all, instead breaking into a fit of laughter.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You've really hit your rebellious phase!" she said. "I hope you're not planning on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        having me stand outside all day. I'm coming in, okay?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Wait, nobody said you could—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Have you forgotten that your father and I pay the rent on this place?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was nothing Amane could do to argue or refuse his mother once she'd played<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that card. Reluctantly, he allowed her to enter.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        To keep her from going into the bedroom, Amane casually guided his mother to walk<p></p>
        <p></p>
        past the bedroom door and into the living room.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "By the way, you really should tell me beforehand when you plan on visiting," said<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Now, I wouldn't be able to get a proper picture of my son's living situation if I didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        show up unannounced, would I?" Shihoko replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ugh… Look, there's no problem, okay? I'm keeping the place clean."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You certainly are; I'm surprised. You never kept your room clean at home, but you're<p></p>
        <p></p>
        doing better than I'd expected. I'm surprised." Shihoko nodded seriously, looking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        genuinely astonished as she surveyed the living room.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The unspoken truth was that his place was only clean because Mahiru had helped<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane tidy up. Her advice and constant scolding was a big part of how his place had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        managed to stay clean, too. Really, Mahiru deserved most of the credit, but there was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        no way Amane was going to tell his mother that now.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Your skin looks good, too; you must be eating well," Shihoko observed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Yeah," Amane admitted, unable to meet his mother's eyes. Even his improved health<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was something he owed to the angel.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're even cooking properly, huh. Oh, but it looks like you're cooking for two?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shihoko's manicured finger was pointing at his dish rack. Two people had eaten lunch,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so naturally there were two sets of dishes. Carelessly, Amane had forgotten to put<p></p>
        <p></p>
        them away. He should've remembered how perceptive his mother could be.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, I had a friend over." Amane's answer was not quite a lie. He'd spoken as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        indifferently as he was able, doing his best to stop himself from shaking. It was fair to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        say that he and Mahiru had built up to something resembling a friendship, so it wasn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        exactly untrue. There was the small matter of hiding that the friend in question was a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        girl.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm," Shihoko replied with a tone that suggested she didn't really accept that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        explanation at face value. She scanned the living room again.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I suppose you get a passing mark. You're doing so well, I can hardly believe you're a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        boy living on his own," Amane's mother finally conceded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Somehow, Amane had been able to deceive her, though only just barely. Strangely, he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        felt a chill run down his spine, and he was sweating bullets. On the other hand, maybe<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he shouldn't have been so surprised to have passed his mother's inspection. Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        really had turned some things around for him, after all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "See, there was nothing for you to worry about, Mom."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I suppose not; though I can hardly believe it. You could barely do anything for yourself<p></p>
        <p></p>
        at home. You've certainly grown up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I'm basically an adult," Amane replied, though inwardly, he scoffed at himself for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        having the audacity to say such a thing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Good job," Shihoko praised, smiling.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It made Amane a little uncomfortable to hear that, since of course he hadn't done any<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of it on his own. There was no way he could risk telling his mother the truth, however,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so he would have to leave things as they were and try to get her out of there.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She's pretty much finished her evaluation, right? I wonder if I can get her to leave<p></p>
        <p></p>
        without saying anything about wanting to eat her cooking or whatever, Amane thought.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That just leaves the bedroom check, I suppose," Shihoko mused nonchalantly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's eyes went wide at the drop of that bomb. Mahiru was still in there. If his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mother found a girl hiding in the bedroom, a far greater disaster would ensue than if<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had just revealed Mahiru from the get-go.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, don't joke around. Even if you're my mom, I don't want you digging around in my<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bedroom."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh? Something in there you're feeling embarrassed about?" Shihoko prodded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "There's probably one or two embarrassing things in any high school guy's room, if<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you think about it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So you admit it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, I admit it. Please don't go in there."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even though it was shameful, there'd been no other choice. Amane had been forced to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        go along with his mother's assumption to keep her from entering the bedroom. If she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        discovered Mahiru in Amane's room, she would most assuredly get the wrong idea.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        For both his own sake and Mahiru's, Amane needed to avoid that at all costs.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Amane's mother saw him blocking the door to his room, desperately trying to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        keep her from getting through, she could tell right away that he was hiding something.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Closing in on her son, Shihoko said, "I suppose you are grown up, if you're hiding those<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sorts of things from your parents."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If it came down to it, Amane was prepared to keep his mom out by force if necessary,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        though he admittedly didn't like that idea. He stood ready to stop her, but then…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Thump. There came a noise from inside the bedroom.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yes."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What are you hiding?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…It has nothing to do with you, Mom."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So you say." A wide grin spread across Shihoko's face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was the kind of coercive smile that could not be denied. Amane became extremely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        uncomfortable every time she looked at him like this. It had a way of sapping his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        willpower to oppose her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane groaned, and Shihoko saw an opening. She put her hand on the doorknob to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his room, and by the time Amane noticed, it was far too late. Shihoko slipped past<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane, intent on discovering the source of the noise on the other side of the door.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        What met her eyes beyond that barrier that Amane had failed to protect was the figure<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of a beautiful girl. She was leaning her back against the side of the bed while hugging<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a cushion to her chest. The girl's eyes were closed, and her breaths were a gentle<p></p>
        <p></p>
        rhythm. Mahiru had dozed off by the time Shihoko discovered her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A warm room with a heater running and a full stomach after lunch were the perfect<p></p>
        <p></p>
        conditions for an afternoon nap. Amane couldn't help but wonder whether Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        often slept in boys' rooms, but all this really confirmed was that she found Amane to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        be harmless enough to doze off in his bedroom.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He couldn't exactly blame her for it. Sitting motionless so as not to make any noise had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        probably gotten real boring real fast.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The main problem was, obviously, Shihoko, who had arrived at just the wrong moment<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to witness a situation she was sure to misunderstand.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Had he been the third party, Amane would have gotten the wrong idea, too. He would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have assumed they were so intimate that Mahiru had no problem drifting off for a nap<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in his room.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Grimacing all the while, Amane glanced over at his mother and saw that her eyes were<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sparkling. He could only imagine the commotion she was about to raise.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh my, Amane, you've got such an adorable girlfriend!" Shihoko shrieked in her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        youthful voice. "This isn't the kind of girl you can just hide away in a corner, you know!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane felt a headache coming on.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She had immediately jumped to possibly the worst conclusion available, and to make<p></p>
        <p></p>
        matters worse, she was clearly very excited about the idea that her son was dating<p></p>
        <p></p>
        such a lovely girl. There was no doubt that even Amane's mother was smitten with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's beauty.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru looked so vulnerable when she was asleep. The practiced air of elegant<p></p>
        <p></p>
        refinement that she always wore like a mask had melted away, revealing the full<p></p>
        <p></p>
        captivating nature of her looks. Her cute face had never looked more peaceful—or<p></p>
        <p></p>
        more pretty.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had grown somewhat accustomed to Mahiru's appearance, but seeing her like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        this, he was once again struck by her incredible charm. Her cherubic face held such an<p></p>
        <p></p>
        innocent serenity. Once again, he felt the urge to reach out and touch her. Her sleeping<p></p>
        <p></p>
        figure, hugging Amane's cushion tight, awakened many desires in him that were best<p></p>
        <p></p>
        kept private.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        This truly captivating girl was Amane's girlfriend, or so his mother thought. It was no<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wonder she was excited.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I suppose the reason you didn't want your mother looking in this room is because<p></p>
        <p></p>
        your girlfriend is here? Look at you, growing up right before my eyes."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's not it! You've got it all wrong! She's not my girlfriend or anything!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come now, you don't have to make excuses! Your mother has no intention of opposing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        your relationship, Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, I'm telling you, that's not the issue here! We're not in a romantic relationship!<p></p>
        <p></p>
        You've got it totally wrong!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, whether I'm right or wrong, she's in your bedroom right now, isn't she?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's because you showed up all of the sudden! We were just hanging out in the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        living room, but I knew you would misunderstand!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You see, the problem with that excuse is that you would never let a girl you don't like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        into your apartment. And I really don't think a girl would just waltz right on into the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apartment of someone she didn't like, would she?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane struggled to find a way to argue the issue. His mother was right; Amane was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        awfully territorial about his living spaces and wasn't inclined to let just anyone into<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his domain.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The first time Mahiru had come in, she'd practically forced her way, but ever since<p></p>
        <p></p>
        then, he'd welcomed her over, even when she wasn't coming to cook for him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I guess that means I really do like her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As far as Amane was concerned, he was sure he liked Mahiru for her personality, not<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her appearance. He enjoyed that seemingly contradictory part to her. There was a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        biting and honest side of her that she didn't show at school, and yet she found it hard<p></p>
