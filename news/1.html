        From 2027 to 2029, Maris Stella High School (MSHS) will be rebuilt to provide better facilities for both its primary and secondary school students. (New campus 2030)
        </p>
        <p>
        The primary school section will, for the first time, take in girls in 2027 when it moves to its holding site at the former  <abbr title="(beside St Magarets, are they sharing the space w/SM pri :O idk)">MacPherson Primary School site in Mattar Road</abbr>. The school, which currently admits 270 Primary 1 pupils, will look into increasing its intake in 2027.
        </p>
        <p>
        The secondary school sectionâ€™s holding site will be at the former Bedok North Secondary School site <abbr title="Bedok North too lanjiao alr + not enough facilities">(and half a vaccination centre)</abbr> in Jalan Damai.
        </p>
        <p>
        MSHS (P) will operate <abbr title="back to before the 2000s, eh?">morning sessions for P3-P6, but afternoon session for P1-P2</abbr> during the rebuilding. It will revert back to single-session when the new campus is built.
        </p>
        <p>MSHS (Secondary) will remain an all-boys school for now.</p>
        <p>Apparently, Mr Boy said it was 'to allow the daughters of alumnus* to benefit'.</p>
