        <p>Since the return of Sports Day (Now re-branded 'Sports Carnival'), Chanel has finally won the trophy after 6-8 years</p>
        <p>The last time Chanel won the Sports Day was <i><abbr title="who knows, i think it was 2017">2018</abbr>. Just last year, Chanel had gotten last place for overall house placings.</p>
        <p>No one is sure when Chanel won the last overall House competition (a.k.a. House shield).</p>
        <p>In third place was Champagnat, and second place <abbr title="I hope i remembered this correctly">Alfano</abbr></p>
