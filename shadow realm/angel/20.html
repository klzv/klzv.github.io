        you. It must be suffocating to have to suffer through such awful stuff."<p></p>
        He didn't actually want to make her cry, but if she kept bottling it up like this, at some<p></p>
        point, she would crack.<p></p>
        So he wanted her to let out all her frustrations, everything she was holding back, and<p></p>
        cry if she needed. And he would be there by her side if she needed him, too.<p></p>
        He couldn't do much other than support her.<p></p>
        Amane wondered if he wasn't being too presumptuous, but as Mahiru wriggled in his<p></p>
        arms and buried her face in Amane's chest, all that apprehension disappeared.<p></p>
        "…Will you keep it a secret?" she asked in a small voice.<p></p>
        "I can't see you, so I know nothing."<p></p>
        "…All right then, just for a little bit… let me lean on you," she mumbled. It was the first<p></p>
        time she had ever asked him for support.<p></p>
        Amane didn't respond—he felt like he might be the one to cry if he tried. Instead, he<p></p>
        just pulled the blanket farther up over Mahiru's shoulders and held her tight.<p></p>
        "…Promise you didn't look?"<p></p>
        Mahiru hadn't cried for long, maybe ten minutes, tops.<p></p>
        It would have been great if she could have cried enough to get out sixteen years' worth<p></p>
        of anguish, but that seemed like more than her body could handle right now. If she<p></p>
        added physical fatigue to her mental stress, her brain would probably just shut down.<p></p>
        Mahiru's cheeks were wet when she lifted her face, but she seemed to have recovered<p></p>
        a little of her spirit, because when her eyes met Amane's, her gaze did not waver.<p></p>
        "Well, you were leaning up against me, so I couldn't really see much. I definitely didn't<p></p>
        see you crying or anything."<p></p>
        Mahiru had slipped off the blanket and smiled gently.<p></p>
        "…Amane?"<p></p>
        "What is it?"<p></p>
        "…Thank you."<p></p>
        "I don't know what you're talking about," Amane replied, looking in the other<p></p>
        direction. He didn't feel like he'd done anything worth thanking him for.<p></p>
        Mahiru buried her face in his chest again.<p></p>
        "Let me stay here a little bit longer, please."<p></p>
        "…Sure."<p></p>
        It wasn't like he could push Mahiru aside when she was in this state even if he wanted<p></p>
        to. Besides, he wanted to support her however he could. Calmly, he put his arm around<p></p>
        her again and gently stroked her hair.<p></p>
        If nobody else will tell her how wonderful she is, I'll do it myself, Amane thought. He<p></p>
        wanted her to feel like she didn't have to try so hard anymore. Like she could relax,<p></p>
        now that she was with him.<p></p>
        Mahiru must have calmed down somewhat. When she looked up at Amane, she didn't<p></p>
        seem so upset. But she didn't look especially cheerful, either. She probably still had a<p></p>
        lot on her mind.<p></p>
        "…I wonder what I should do now," Mahiru mumbled quietly. She gave a troubled smile<p></p>
        as she looked into Amane's eyes.<p></p>
        "I can try my hardest all I want, but my parents won't even look at me. Even if other<p></p>
        people heap on the praise, call me an angel and whatever else, that doesn't mean a<p></p>
        thing. Sure, the Mahiru Shiina that they all know, the angel, is idolized and popular,<p></p>
        but… nobody cares about the real me. And the worst part is that it's all my fault. I set<p></p>
        myself up this way." She smiled bitterly and grasped the fabric of Amane's shirt tightly.<p></p>
        "The real me is cowardly and selfish and dull, and… there's just nothing there to like."<p></p>
        "I like you a fair bit," Amane answered without thinking. Mahiru looked surprised as<p></p>
        he continued, "I mean, sure, you're not a hundred percent perfect all the time, but I<p></p>
        really do think you're charming, and I always admire your honesty. You're being too<p></p>
        hard on yourself." He reached out and tapped her lightly on the forehead. "Besides, if<p></p>
        you were as selfish as you said, you wouldn't care about what other people think."<p></p>
        Mahiru looked stunned. But the sorrow had faded from her expression.<p></p>
        Amane just couldn't understand why Mahiru was always putting herself down. Surely<p></p>
        anyone could see for themselves that she was a hardworking person and a<p></p>
        tenderhearted girl. She was honest but considerate, and though she had called herself<p></p>
        cowardly, Amane knew that Mahiru had been hurt so much before that it made sense<p></p>
        for her to assume a defensive posture by default.<p></p>
        And besides, if she really was so dull, why was Amane always agonizing over her?<p></p>
        He only wished she knew how much more charming she was when she was her honest<p></p>
        self with him.<p></p>
        "Don't put yourself down like that," Amane said, gazing into Mahiru's caramel-coloured<p></p>
        eyes. "After all, there's someone right here who has seen the real you and adores you."<p></p>
        Mahiru was convinced that nobody loved her. That must have been why she had no<p></p>
        confidence. But Amane wasn't the only person who liked her—even Chitose had<p></p>
        grown really attached to her. Mahiru was obviously wrong about herself.<p></p>
        She looked away from Amane, and her cheeks started to turn red as she pulled herself<p></p>
        into a ball. Amane realized what he had said and began to blush as well.<p></p>
        "I—I mean, Chitose and everybody thinks so, too! So don't get the wrong idea," Amane<p></p>
        explained frantically. "But anyway, it's not just me. My parents, and Chitose and Itsuki,<p></p>
        too—they all saw the parts of you that aren't the angel you always pretend to be, and<p></p>
        they all still like being around you! Honestly, you're much more… well, I think your<p></p>
        personality is much more likable than you think."<p></p>
        Amane obviously hadn't done a good job explaining himself. Mahiru's face was still<p></p>
        bright red. Amane had become pretty embarrassed himself—after all, he was the one<p></p>
        saying all that stuff.<p></p>
        "So look, if you want to stop trying so hard because your parents are going hate you<p></p>
        no matter what, then you're welcome to escape to my house whenever you feel like it.<p></p>
        If my folks know the situation, they'll gladly take you in. You can think of it like time to<p></p>
        recuperate."<p></p>
        "…Mm."<p></p>
        "My mom and dad have really taken a liking to you, so I think they would probably let<p></p>
        you stay for a long time… Actually, they might not leave you alone until you cheer up.<p></p>
        None of us can decide for you what you should do about your parents, but we can take<p></p>
        care of you until you reach a decision and keep supporting you after."<p></p>
        "Mm…"<p></p>
        Amane was trying his best not to come across the wrong way, but Mahiru started<p></p>
        crying again.<p></p>
        "Wh-why are you crying?"<p></p>
        "I just… feel so lucky."<p></p>
        "I dunno; you seem pretty much the opposite to me…"<p></p>
        Maybe Mahiru was blessed when it came to money, but aside from that, nobody gave<p></p>
        her anything. She hadn't received one bit of the love she deserved. Honestly, it was a<p></p>
        wonder she had grown up without becoming twisted and bitter.<p></p>
        Someone should take care of this Mahiru. And Mahiru should take care of herself, too.<p></p>
        She should take back a little of what no one offered her, he thought.<p></p>
        "…In that case, can I make some requests?"<p></p>
        "What will it be? I'll do whatever I can."<p></p>
        Mahiru smiled a little. "They're things only you can do, Amane," she murmured. "Like,<p></p>
        look at me more."<p></p>
        "I already can't take my eyes off you," he replied. "I'm in awe of everything you do."<p></p>
        "Also, hold me more."<p></p>
        He peered down at Mahiru, wondering if that was all.<p></p>
        "I'm already holding your hand."<p></p>
        Mahiru stared at Amane for a moment, then looked bashful.<p></p>
        "For today, hold me with your whole body."<p></p>
        As soon as she finished her sentence, she wrapped her arms around Amane's neck and<p></p>
        buried her face in his chest again. Amane was startled for a moment but knew that he<p></p>
        mustn't get any rude ideas. He swallowed deeply and once again embraced her delicate<p></p>
        body.<br>

        Chapter 25: The Angel’s Metamorphosis<p></p>
        Mahiru was acting strange the following day as well.<p></p>
        To be more precise, she didn't appear as dejected as she had the day before, nor did<p></p>
        she look especially sad. But she was very stiff and seemed wary in a way that was<p></p>
        difficult to describe.<p></p>
        Even though he was just sitting beside Mahiru on the living room sofa, Amane felt like<p></p>
        she was surrounded by an air of crackling tension. When he tried to so much as glance<p></p>
        at her, she practically jumped, squeezing her favorite cushion tight. However, Amane<p></p>
        could also tell by looking at the reflection in his smartphone screen that whenever he<p></p>
        looked away from her, she stared directly at him. 2<p></p>
        He wondered why she was acting this way—and soon came to the conclusion that it<p></p>
        must be because of what had happened the day before. 6<p></p>
        …She must still feel pretty awkward.<p></p>
        Yesterday, the two of them had embraced—and even though he had been doing it to<p></p>
        console her, he was worried that it was going to cause problems for their relationship.<p></p>
        Clinging to him may have been a momentary impulse, and there was a chance she<p></p>
        regretted it now that she had come back to her senses.<p></p>
        Recently, they'd had a lot of close, physical contact, but this was the first time she had<p></p>
        pressed herself against him so boldly. It was inevitable that she would feel a little<p></p>
        rattled afterward.<p></p>
        Though it doesn't seem like she hates me for it or anything.<p></p>
        If she did, he reasoned, she wouldn't be here, in his apartment, sitting next to him.<p></p>
        But whenever he reached out toward her, she pulled away from him.<p></p>
        "…Should I just give you some space?"<p></p>
        "N-no, that's not it."<p></p>
        He had figured it would be best to keep his distance for a while until she had calmed<p></p>
        down, and had suggested as much, but Mahiru hurriedly shook her head.<p></p>
        "Th-this is, well… I'm just ashamed because you saw me in such a pathetic state. I cried<p></p>
        so hard…"<p></p>
        "Ah… I see…"<p></p>
        Apparently, she was embarrassed by all the tears. He recalled that after her sobs had<p></p>
        subsided the other night, she'd chilled the area around her eyes with ice, so it wouldn't<p></p>
        swell up. But nothing she did could change the fact that Amane had seen her in that<p></p>
        vulnerable state, which seemed to really upset her.<p></p>
        "Well, it didn't really bother me, so—"<p></p>
        "But it bothers me. It was the biggest mistake of my life to let you see me like that."<p></p>
        "That's going a little far… Look, if you bottle all those things up, it's obvious that<p></p>
        eventually you're going to explode, dummy."<p></p>
        It seemed like Mahiru was about to put on one of her characteristic shows of courage,<p></p>
        so Amane sighed, and before she could stop him, he reached out and pinched her<p></p>
        cheek. Her skin was soft and supple between his fingers.<p></p>
        Mahiru looked confused and nervous. She stared hard at Amane. "Hey, what are you<p></p>
        doing?"<p></p>
        "If you don't let your feelings out, you're going to crack at some point. It's okay to let<p></p>
        other people support you, really. If I'm acceptable, then you can depend on me. If you<p></p>
        want to cry, I'll cover you up anytime and pretend I can't see you. You need to learn to<p></p>
        let other people take care of you a little."<p></p>
        Yesterday, she had let some of what she had pent up come bursting out, but it seemed<p></p>
        like there was a lot more where that came from. Criticizing Mahiru for her reluctance,<p></p>
        he pinched her cheek hard as admonishment.<p></p>
        If she was to say that Amane was unreliable and that she couldn't depend on him, he<p></p>
        would resign himself to that assessment and accept his dismissal. But as long as that<p></p>
        wasn't the case, he wanted her to rely on him more and give him a chance to take care<p></p>
        of her sometimes. He wanted to be there for her, especially when she had nobody else.<p></p>
        "Yesterday, you nodded like you understood, so why are you backtracking on that<p></p>
        now? You can depend on me. You are not alone."<p></p>
        "…Not alone…" Mahiru nodded as she considered his words. She looked positively<p></p>
        dumbfounded by the notion that she did not have to endure everything by herself.<p></p>
        Amane ruffled her hair. "I'm always in your corner. If you call them, Chitose and Itsuki<p></p>
        will show up, too, as will my parents. That's how many people care about you—about<p></p>
        the real Mahiru."<p></p>
        Mahiru had lamented the fact that no one wanted her. But that was in the past. Things<p></p>
        were different now. There were so many people who cherished Mahiru and wanted to<p></p>
        help her. She had to know how much she meant to everyone.<p></p>
        Mahiru was silent for a little while as she considered what Amane had said. Then,<p></p>
        timidly, she looked up at him, with eyes that were searching for reassurance.<p></p>
        "…And you?"<p></p>
        "Hmm?"<p></p>
        "Do you also care about me…?"<p></p>
        Amane's breath caught in his throat for a moment, then he scratched his cheek. "I<p></p>
        mean… if we're sitting here together like this, that must mean I care about you quite a<p></p>
        lot."<p></p>
        Amane knew he could be pretty aloof. He just wasn't interested in spending a lot of<p></p>
        energy on a relationship with somebody unless they were really important to him. But<p></p>
        when he did care about someone, he was always willing to go to whatever lengths<p></p>
        were necessary to help them.<p></p>
        And he had cared about Mahiru for a long time now.<p></p>
        He wanted to take some of the painful burden off of her delicate shoulders. He wanted<p></p>
        her to smile peacefully. He wanted her to be happy—he wanted to make her happy.<p></p>
        "…Really…?"<p></p>
        Mahiru mumbled, burying her face in the cushion. Amane figured it must be pretty<p></p>
        embarrassing to hear all that out loud. On the other hand, he was the one who'd had<p></p>
        to say all that out loud, so if anyone was going to be embarrassed, it was him.<p></p>
        …Though I'm sure that Mahiru won't take it the wrong way.<p></p>
        He was really worried she might think he was trying to take advantage of her<p></p>
        vulnerability. Obviously, if that's what she thought, their time together would quickly<p></p>
        end.<p></p>
        Fortunately, Mahiru didn't seem to have noticed Amane's anxiety.<p></p>
        She slowly lifted her face out of the cushion and glanced up at him.<p></p>
        "…Amane?"<p></p>
        "What's up?"<p></p>
        "W-would you, um, turn and face the other way?"<p></p>
        "Huh? Why?"<p></p>
        "D-don't worry about why…"<p></p>
        He was confused as to why she was suddenly asking him to turn around, but he<p></p>
        obediently turned his back to Mahiru.<p></p>
        He was waiting anxiously, sitting cross-legged on the sofa, when he felt something soft<p></p>
        and warm press against his back. That was enough of a surprise to make Amane go<p></p>
        completely stiff, and when her slender arms wrapped around his chest, he was<p></p>
        practically petrified.<p></p>
        Mahiru was obviously hugging him from behind. At the moment, Amane was grateful<p></p>
        that she wasn't doing it from the front.<p></p>
        "…Uh, Ma-Mahiru…?" Amane stammered, feeling his heart pounding in his chest.<p></p>
        She stirred slightly, still clinging to his back. "…So about yesterday… thank you very<p></p>
        much. I wanted to tell you again how grateful I am."<p></p>
        Maybe that was why she was holding on to him this way. It was easier for her to thank<p></p>
        him if he wasn't looking right at her.<p></p>
        "O-okay…"<p></p>
        "…You've given me so, so much, Amane."<p></p>
        "B-but I really didn't do anything special…"<p></p>
        "You may think it's not important, but it's a big deal to me. So again, thank you."<p></p>
        "…Sure."<p></p>
        "I'm so glad to have you by my side. I'm not sure how well I could deal with everything<p></p>
        if I had to face it alone."<p></p>
        "…Oh?"<p></p>
        This was probably Mahiru's way of showing him that she cared.<p></p>
        Amane was happy that Mahiru felt like she could lean on him. He put his hands over<p></p>
        hers, wanting to let her know that he had no intention of leaving her alone. When he<p></p>
        did, her whole body suddenly shuddered.<p></p>
        Realizing that he had probably gotten too carried away again, Amane pulled his hand<p></p>
        away in a panic, but Mahiru explained in a voice that was muffled because her face<p></p>
        was slightly buried in his back. "I-it's okay; I was just surprised…" One of her hands<p></p>
        roamed around, trying to find Amane's again.<p></p>
        Feeling relieved, Amane grasped Mahiru's hand, and this time she squeezed him back.<p></p>
        Amane shivered in surprise, and when he did, he felt Mahiru's head press against his<p></p>
        back.<p></p>
        "…Weren't you going to be the one holding me?"<p></p>
        "I-if you're okay with that…"<p></p>
        "You're the only person I would ever do something like this with, Amane," she said<p></p>
        sweetly. "The only one."<p></p>
        Amane stiffened again. He felt Mahiru trying to bury her face in his back. She must<p></p>
        have been pretty embarrassed after her sudden confession. Even so, Mahiru didn't let<p></p>
        him go, and he felt like she must trust him a great deal, and that made him so
        <p></p>
        self-conscious he wanted to tear his own heart out.<p></p>
        In fact, Amane was sure he was even more embarrassed than Mahiru was.<p></p>
        Eventually, Mahiru seemed to calm down, and once again she squeezed Amane's hand<p></p>
        tightly.<p></p>
        "…A-anyway, like you promised… please see me for who I really am. Never take your<p></p>
        eyes off me."<p></p>
        "S-sure. But I… uh… can't really see you right now…"<p></p>
        "Well, if you looked at me now, I'd get mad."<p></p>
        "O-oh, of course… Well, I definitely cannot see you when we sit like this, so… I guess<p></p>
        you can relax."<p></p>
        He knew she was probably trying to hide her embarrassment, so he obediently<p></p>
        followed her instructions. More importantly, trying to take a peek would just upset<p></p>
        her.<p></p>
        Besides, Amane thought, covering his face with his free hand, it's better if she doesn't<p></p>
        see me right now, either. He let out a quiet sigh.<p></p>
        …At this point, it would be weirder if I didn't fall for her.<p></p>
        "The new semester is starting soon, huh?"<p></p>
        It was several days after Mahiru's tearful revelation. She seemed totally back to<p></p>
        normal—she wasn't acting tense or stealing awkward glances at him or anything. And<p></p>
        when she looked up from the textbook she was reading and muttered to Amane, it was<p></p>
        like she had just remembered what day it was.<p></p>
        Since their talk, the two of them had gotten even closer. Maybe it was because they<p></p>
        were reading from the same book, but there were probably currently only two or three<p></p>
        hands' worth of open space between them. They were close enough that Amane could<p></p>
        feel Mahiru's warmth and smell the sweet scent coming off her. From time to time,<p></p>
        something soft would bump into him.<p></p>
        Amane was only just barely holding it together.<p></p>
        "G-guess it does, y-yeah. Once this weekend is over, it'll be a whole new semester. Kind<p></p>
        of depressing that there'll be a class change."<p></p>
        "In what way…?"<p></p>
        "I'm not good at making friends, so once Itsuki's gone, I won't have anyone to hang out<p></p>
        with."<p></p>
        Mahiru looked surprised. "How can you be so sure of that…?"<p></p>
        "Don't get me wrong, I can carry on a normal conversation as good as the next guy. But<p></p>
        I never get past being acquaintances, that's all."<p></p>
        Amane sort of knew how to talk to people all right, but that wasn't the same as making<p></p>
        friends. He just felt like his personality didn't have much to offer, and he certainly<p></p>
        wasn't particularly charming, so he'd usually had trouble making friends. He had<p></p>
        always been more of a background character anyway.<p></p>
        But he was the type of person who was just fine on his own, and if he was separated<p></p>
        from Itsuki, that was just the way things went and couldn't be helped. He would simply<p></p>
        spend the year on his own.<p></p>
        "…You don't ever take the first step forward, do you, Amane?"<p></p>
        "Uh—"<p></p>
        "You're a good person. I think it's a shame that you don't know anyone outside of Itsuki<p></p>
        and Chitose. People would like you if they just got to know you a little, so you should<p></p>
        really dial back the whole aloof and indifferent act. There's no reason to keep everyone<p></p>
        at arm's length all the time. It's a waste of potential." She reached over and brushed<p></p>
        his bangs out of his eyes.<p></p>
        Amane felt intensely embarrassed and tried to looked anywhere else instead of at<p></p>
        Mahiru.<p></p>
        "…I don't really want to get to know a lot of people, is the thing. I think I'm good with<p></p>
        being close to a very limited number of people."<p></p>
        "Why do you feel that way?"<p></p>
        "Why…?"<p></p>
        That seemed obvious to him.<p></p>
        —I'm afraid of being betrayed. Like I was in the past.<p></p>
        Amane thought it was best to only get close to people he was absolutely sure he could<p></p>
        trust. That was how he had come to his current social standing.<p></p>
        "…Well, I don't really need anyone else. As long as I've got you, I'm good."<p></p>
        "…Huh?"<p></p>
        "W-wait, that's not what I meant! I was thinking more like, I'm happy as long as I've<p></p>
        got my close friends, including Itsuki and Chitose, too. I don't want a lot of excitement<p></p>
        in my life," Amane explained at light speed. He didn't want her to get the wrong<p></p>
        impression… even if that impression would have been more accurate than he wanted<p></p>
        to admit.<p></p>
        Mahiru was looking at him with an expression of mixed relief and absolute<p></p>
        bewilderment. Her cheeks were turning red. Apparently, she had gotten the wrong<p></p>
        impression after all.<p></p>
        "…So you also depend on me, Amane?"<p></p>
        "You're, like, the only thing holding me up, in more ways than one."<p></p>
        "When you say it that way, it sounds like I'm quite important in your life, you know."<p></p>
        She said it like she was criticizing him, but her tone of voice was gentle. She looked at<p></p>
        him with a gaze that said What a hopeless guy.<p></p>
        Amane was grappling with some very complicated feelings, so he scratched his cheek<p></p>
        and tried to change the subject. "Well anyway, how are you feeling about the new<p></p>
        classes? Are you looking forward to the change?"<p></p>
        Mahiru blinked several times, then relaxed into a smile. "I am looking forward to the<p></p>
        class changes."<p></p>
        "Well, I guess you'll survive no matter which class you end up in, huh?"<p></p>
        "That's true, but I'd rather do more than survive. Wouldn't you?"<p></p>
        "I guess you're right."<p></p>
        Getting along with people on a superficial level didn't mean that Mahiru would<p></p>
        actually be happy. But she was the kind of person who had to maintain a perfect facade<p></p>
        no matter how exhausting that could be.<p></p>
        On the other hand, there was a chance that Mahiru and Chitose would be in the same<p></p>
        class. That would give Mahiru the chance to spend more time with a friend who had<p></p>
        seen her true nature. It seemed like the best outcome.<p></p>
        "Amane, do you know why I'm looking forward to the class changes?"<p></p>
        Amane was startled to see Mahiru wearing a slightly impish smile, and he put a hand<p></p>
        to his mouth as he pondered the question.<p></p>
        "…Because there's a chance you'll be in the same class with Chitose?"<p></p>
        "Okay, well there's that, too… but it's not the right answer, you dummy," she teased.<p></p>
        Amane knew she wasn't trying to insult him, but he could hear a slightly peevish tone<p></p>
        in her words, so he decided he'd better humor her for the time being. He stroked her<p></p>
        hair, careful not to mess it up. "That's me, a big dummy," he said ruefully.<p></p>
        "…You're awfully sly, Amane."<p></p>
        "Wh-what do you mean?"<p></p>
        "It's okay; you don't have to understand. Just… please don't forget about me once the<p></p>
        new semester starts, all right?"<p></p>
        Suddenly, Mahiru shifted, leaning against him with all her weight. He struggled to keep<p></p>
        his heart from leaping out of his chest at her.<p></p>
        …What are you trying to do, Mahiru?<p></p>
        It sounded almost like Mahiru was planning something. Amane suddenly had a bad<p></p>
        feeling about the next week's opening ceremony. He'd been hoping that the coming<p></p>
        semester would be a peaceful one.<p></p>
        Chapter 26: You Are Not Alone<p></p>
        The day before the start of the new semester, Amane was slovenly sprawled out on his<p></p>
        sofa, lazily watching the news on television.<p></p>
        He was feeling carefree despite the upcoming school year, both because the weather<p></p>
        had settled down into the perfect climate for napping, and because no matter what<p></p>
        class he was assigned, he knew his social standing wouldn't change.<p></p>
        Through eyes blurry from yawning, he stared at the TV, where a serious-looking<p></p>
        announcer was reporting on the best times to see the cherry blossoms. The broadcast<p></p>
        covered where the viewing was currently best, how many people were expected to go<p></p>
        out to see the trees, and which regions were in full bloom. It all sounded very lively.<p></p>
        Apparently, the region he was living in was close to full bloom, too. According to the<p></p>
        news report, the flowers had blossomed quite early this year. It was a surprise to see<p></p>
        them out before the start of the new semester. It reminded Amane of his hometown,<p></p>
        actually, where they usually bloomed this time of year.<p></p>
        Cherry blossoms, huh…?<p></p>
        Amane had never really cared about the changing of the seasons all that much, but he<p></p>
        could understand why some people found it charming. He did have some fondness for<p></p>
        the cherry blossoms and liked to see the pale petals.<p></p>
        Come to think of it, there was a row of cherry trees not that far from here, near the river…<p></p>
        Amane slowly sat up.<p></p>
        I really loafed around over spring break, huh? I guess I shouldn't be surprised…<p></p>
        Aside from a moderate amount of weight training and some light jogging, he hadn't<p></p>
        gone anywhere or done anything.<p></p>
        Amane had always preferred the indoors, but he'd basically spent the entire holiday<p></p>
        sitting in his apartment with Mahiru, so he figured it would probably do him some<p></p>
        good to go outside for a change.<p></p>
        He was annoyed that it had taken a news report to get him moving, but today was the<p></p>
        last day of spring break, so if he didn't seize this opportunity, he would have to wait a<p></p>
        whole week. Really, he had no choice but to just go for it—no time like the present,<p></p>
        after all.<p></p>
        Amane rolled off the sofa and changed into appropriate street clothes. He was going<p></p>
        alone, so he didn't bother getting into mystery man mode.<p></p>
        Since he was just one lone guy, getting ready was simple. After he changed, he grabbed<p></p>
        his bag, stuck his phone and wallet inside, then prepared to leave.<p></p>
        Just as Amane opened the door, a ripple of golden hair filled his vision.<p></p>
        "Oh, Amane, where are you going?"<p></p>
        Mahiru was in her usual clothes, so she was probably actually just on her way over to<p></p>
        his place. It would be pretty awkward to set off now.<p></p>
        "Mahiru? Oh, I thought I would go for a bit of a walk. It's the last day of spring break,<p></p>
        you know. Today's it."<p></p>
        "I see. You were kind of a hermit over the break, weren't you?"<p></p>
        "Oh, hush… A-anyway, I won't be back for a couple hours, so if you want to chill at my<p></p>
        place, that's fine. What are you up to?"<p></p>
        Amane thought that his apartment had more entertainment options, so she might<p></p>
        appreciate that, but on the other hand, she would probably feel more comfortable in<p></p>
        her own home, so… he decided to leave it up to her.<p></p>
        Mahiru was staring silently up at him. Her eyes suggested that she might have<p></p>
        something to say.<p></p>
        Amane wasn't sure what he was supposed to do. Nervously, he scratched his cheek.<p></p>
        "Wh-what's up? You look like you want to come with me or something."<p></p>
        Amane had been about to play it off like a joke when Mahiru suddenly nodded.<p></p>
        "…I do."<p></p>
        "Eh?!"<p></p>
        A shrill, strangled sound spilled out from Amane's throat.<p></p>
        "But if you don't want me to…," Mahiru muttered, "that's fine, too, I guess."<p></p>
        "I-it's not that I don't you want to… It's just… How can I put this? If someone sees us<p></p>
        together, the rumors will start up again. Aren't you worried?"<p></p>
        "Rumors are rumors. People are free to think whatever they want."<p></p>
        "G-got it," Amane replied, caught off guard by Mahiru's sudden boldness. "Well, you<p></p>
        probably want to go get ready, so how about we leave in an hour?"<p></p>
        Mahiru was wearing her normal, casual clothes. She looked great just like that, but<p></p>
        Amane figured that, being a girl, she would probably want time to change. Plus, he<p></p>
        decided he ought to go make himself look presentable if he was going to be walking<p></p>
        beside her. Otherwise, he would end up causing her double the trouble.<p></p>
        I'd better do something about my hair, he thought as he touched his bangs.<p></p>
        Mahiru frowned, maybe because she had realized the real reason he wanted to delay<p></p>
        their departure. "Sorry to make you go through all that trouble for my sake…"<p></p>
        "Eh, don't worry about it. Besides, it'll be a good change of pace to take a walk. And I<p></p>
        think the scenery will look nicer if you're walking with me."<p></p>
        It wouldn't really take too much effort to clean himself up, and it was worth it to spend<p></p>
        time with Mahiru. He thought that she would look even more lovely than the cherry<p></p>
        blossoms. Having a beauty like that beside him would make it all worth it, so he didn't<p></p>
        begrudge her the extra effort.<p></p>
        "All right then, so I'll see you in bit?"<p></p>
        "O-okay."<p></p>
        Mahiru seemed quite reticent, but Amane just gave her a pat on the head and then<p></p>
        ducked back into his apartment to change and work on his hairdo.<p></p>
        Both of them were finished getting ready after about an hour, so Amane and Mahiru<p></p>
        set off on a leisurely walk.<p></p>
        Mahiru was dressed for spring. Her white dress was adorned with lace, and she wore<p></p>
        a light-pink cardigan on top. The dress came to just above her knees, which was a little<p></p>
        short for Mahiru, but she had on stockings, so her legs were still covered. She had even<p></p>
        gone to the trouble of braiding her hair into a half-up style. For such a simple outing,<p></p>
        she had certainly taken the time to compose herself, and Amane couldn't help but<p></p>
        marvel at the beauty walking beside him.<p></p>
        "Is something the matter?"<p></p>
        "Oh, you just look very stylish today, as usual."<p></p>
        "…Thank you."<p></p>
        Mahiru's cheeks flushed slightly, and she turned away, looking every bit the innocent<p></p>
        young damsel.<p></p>
        Owing to her striking appearance, Amane could feel eyes on them as they walked<p></p>
        down the road. Mahiru didn't seem bothered by the attention, but when she looked up<p></p>
        at him, he noticed that she was still slightly flustered. "S-so, did you have a destination<p></p>
        in mind?"<p></p>
        "Well, I thought we might go down to the river and check out the cherry blossoms. I<p></p>
        heard they've bloomed earlier than usual this year, and right now is the best time to<p></p>
        see them."<p></p>
        "…Oh really?"<p></p>
        "So I thought I'd go take a look. Does that sound okay?"<p></p>
        "O-of course. I'm following you."<p></p>
        He felt sort of awkward, but when she gripped his sleeve tightly, all trivial thoughts<p></p>
        vanished from his mind.<p></p>
        Her innocent gesture and endearing gaze made his heart leap suddenly in his chest<p></p>
        and his breath catch in his throat.<p></p>
        …This is really a problem. She's way too cute.<p></p>
        Obviously, Mahiru was quite beautiful, but since he'd gotten to know her, Amane had<p></p>
        only grown more infatuated. And when she touched him like that, it only intensified<p></p>
        his feelings.<p></p>
        Amane brushed her delicate hand off of his sleeve and clasped his own hand around<p></p>
        it, struggling to keep his excitement in check.<p></p>
        "Come on, let's go."<p></p>
        "Y-yeah."<p></p>
        It was spring break, so there were a lot of people out. As they held hands so they<p></p>
        wouldn't lose each other, Mahiru lowered her gaze bashfully, and Amane squeezed 3<p></p>
        tightly and tried to keep his cool.<p></p>
        When they arrived at the riverside not far from their apartment complex, the place<p></p>
        was crowded, just like they had expected. For students, it was the final day of spring<p></p>
        break, and for adults, it was the perfect time for a flower-viewing party. The area<p></p>
        bustled with people sitting on tarps and blankets, enjoying the occasion.<p></p>
        The cherry blossoms were nearly in full bloom, and the pale petals danced before<p></p>
        Amane's eyes.<p></p>
        "…Incredible! It's even better than I expected."<p></p>
        Amane mumbled to himself as he watched the cherry petals flutter in the breeze. He<p></p>
        wasn't particularly interested in flowers, but he appreciated beauty when he saw it,<p></p>
        and the delicate pink petals were undeniably beautiful.<p></p>
        He sighed and glanced over at Mahiru, who was staring wordlessly up at the cherry<p></p>
        trees. The breathtaking colors were reflected in her wide eyes. Amane wondered what<p></p>
        she was thinking.<p></p>
        "Mahiru?"<p></p>
        When he called out to her, she blinked rapidly, then turned to him in surprise. There<p></p>
        was a strange air about her.<p></p>
        "What's up? You looked like you were zoning out."<p></p>
        "…N-nothing," Mahiru answered. "I was just… I was thinking that these really are<p></p>
        cherry trees."<p></p>
        "That's because they are…," he said incredulously. "Did… did something happen? You<p></p>
        looked sort of different, and… I dunno. I was worried."<p></p>
        "No, it's nothing important." Mahiru frowned. "…I just don't like… cherry blossoms…<p></p>
        or spring very much, you know?"<p></p>
        "Ah, sorry, I didn't realize. I guess I shouldn't have invited you."<p></p>
        Amane immediately regretted taking her, but Mahiru slowly shook her head side to side.<p></p>
        "No, I don't mean that I hate the flowers themselves or anything… It's just, when I look<p></p>
        at the cherry blossoms, I'm reminded that I don't have any happy memories of them."<p></p>
        "No happy memories?"<p></p>
        "Yes, because I didn't have anyone to make them with."<p></p>
        Mahiru smiled in a way that only made her look forlorn. She didn't seem upset. Just<p></p>
        sad, like she had come to terms with her loneliness a long time ago. Seeing her like<p></p>
        that put an acrid taste in Amane's mouth.<p></p>
        "Entrance ceremonies… and graduations, too, actually. I was alone for all of them. Miss<p></p>
        Koyuki, the maid, didn't start her shift until the afternoon, and my parents always had<p></p>
        more important things to do. My father would usually at least stop by to say<p></p>
        congratulations or something, but…"<p></p>
        Mahiru's smile was small and bitter, and she looked up at the blossoming cherry trees.<p></p>
        "When everyone else was holding hands with their parents under the cherry trees, I<p></p>
        would walk home alone. And nobody was waiting for me…" Mahiru hung her head. "So<p></p>
        you see, I don't really like spring very much. It reminds me that I don't have anyone.<p></p>
        That probably sounds beyond pitiful…"<p></p>
        When Mahiru had finished, Amane couldn't help giving her hand a little squeeze. He<p></p>
        wanted to remind her that he was still there.<p></p>
        There were many things that he would have liked to say to Mahiru's parents, but right<p></p>
        now he wanted to make sure she knew that she was not alone.<p></p>
        "Well I'm here with you right now. I'm even holding your hand."<p></p>
        He stared into Mahiru's caramel-coloured eyes.<p></p>
        She blinked dramatically, and her face twisted into a smile. "I suppose you are…," she<p></p>
        murmured as she squeezed his hand a little tighter.<p></p>
        Amane gave her a reassuring smile, and with his other hand, he reached out and<p></p>
        stroked Mahiru's hair.<p></p>
        "And hey, if that's not enough, I can always call Itsuki and Chitose. And my parents live<p></p>
        pretty far away, but I'm sure if I called them, they would definitely come running…"<p></p>
        "I-it's fine. You don't need to do all that."<p></p>
        "No? All right then. Sounds like you'll just have to settle for me."<p></p>
        "…I'm not settling."<p></p>
        "Oh. Sorry, I—"<p></p>
        "No, that's not what I meant… I was trying to say that it's not settling, being with you."<p></p>
        "O-oh?"<p></p>
        Amane could feel a familiar heat rushing to his cheeks. He still maintained the pretense<p></p>
        that he had no amorous intentions toward Mahiru, but hearing her tell him that she<p></p>
        wanted him to be with her, holding her hand… It filled his stomach with butterflies.<p></p>
        Mahiru's expression softened into a small smile as she squeezed his hand and gazed<p></p>
        bashfully at the falling petals. "…I think I'm starting to like the cherry blossoms, just a<p></p>
        little bit."<p></p>
        Amane gently wrapped her small hand up in his.<p></p>
        "Is that so?<p></p>
        Chapter 27: The Start of the New Semester<p></p>
        "Listen, I'm not a kid anymore, you know." Amane's exasperation was obvious from the<p></p>
        way he answered his mother's phone call. He was about to attend the school entrance<p></p>
        ceremony that marked the start of his second year of high school, after all.<p></p>
        Amane couldn't decide whether he was more impressed or irritated by her ability to<p></p>
        time her call for the one free moment in his busy morning routine. She worries too<p></p>
        much, he thought as he sank into the sofa.<p></p>
        His mother had gotten used to the idea of him living alone, but she was clearly still<p></p>
        concerned that an old wound of his might have opened again, dredging up memories<p></p>
        of something from his second year of middle school.<p></p>
        As far as Amane was concerned, though the scar ached sometimes, it never bothered<p></p>
        him much. And more importantly, he didn't want to worry his parents.<p></p>
        "I'm fine. Really—I'll be all right on my own."<p></p>
        "You come tell me anytime it gets tough, okay? Oh, even better, you can lean on sweet<p></p>
        Mahiru!"<p></p>
        "Yeah, yeah…"<p></p>
        Why is she so hung up on Mahiru and me?<p></p>
        His mother had taken a liking to Mahiru and clearly wanted them to spend more time<p></p>
        together, but Amane felt like it was really none of her business. When it came to<p></p>
        matters of romance, he didn't ask for or want any parental meddling, even if she only<p></p>
        meant well.<p></p>
        Most of all, Amane didn't want his mother to figure out just how fond of Mahiru he<p></p>
        really was, so he opted to kept quiet and didn't engage.<p></p>
        "I bet Mahiru would be very receptive."<p></p>
        "Uh-huh…"<p></p>
        "At any rate, if you're having a rough time, make sure to ask someone for help, okay? It<p></p>
        can be anyone. I still think Mahiru would be just perfect, but—"<p></p>
        "Look, I've gotta go soon, so I'm hanging up. Thanks for worrying about me so early in<p></p>
        the morning."<p></p>
        Amane didn't want his mother speculating about his relationship with Mahiru any<p></p>
        further, so he quickly thanked her and ended the call. He could already imagine her on<p></p>
        the other end of the line, probably pouting in displeasure.<p></p>
        She was concerned about him, but she was worrying way too much.<p></p>
        His scars did ache, but not so much that it would bring him to his knees.<p></p>
        Besides, it wouldn't bother him if he just didn't think about it.<p></p>
        …Better to not reach out if I don't need to.<p></p>
        As long as the people I trust stay with me, everything'll be fine.<p></p>
        Amane wasn't worried about the class changes for the new semester. After all, there<p></p>
        was nothing he could do, so he'd decided to do his best to accept whatever came.<p></p>
        Staring at his own gloomy, melancholic reflection in the darkened screen of his phone,<p></p>
        Amane smiled bleakly.<p></p>
        If Chitose and Itsuki saw me like this, they'd slap me right on the back, he thought as he<p></p>
        stood up from the sofa and left for the first day of school.<p></p>
        Walking to school after two weeks off felt a bit nostalgic. After arriving, Amane<p></p>
        approached the central bulletin board, intending to check the rosters for each class<p></p>
        posted there.<p></p>
        Although he had come a little earlier than usual, it was the start of the new semester,<p></p>
        so plenty of other students were already there—and surprisingly, one of them was his<p></p>
        friend Itsuki, who emerged from the crowd to greet him.<p></p>
        "Yo, what's up, Amane. Looks like you just got here."<p></p>
        "Morning. Is the sky falling or something? I can't believe you got here before I did."<p></p>
        "My dad chased me out of the house," Itsuki replied with a small grin. "He said I should<p></p>
        at least be early for the first day." He shrugged, as if there was nothing interesting<p></p>
        about it.<p></p>
        Itsuki was at odds with his father, as usual. Since meeting Chitose, he didn't seem<p></p>
        inclined to do anything his parents wanted. Itsuki's father stubbornly refused to<p></p>
        approve of his relationship with Chitose, and ever since then, the two of them never<p></p>
        saw eye to eye. Of course, Itsuki's father could be pretty stern, even before his son had<p></p>
        started dating, Amane thought that he was overall an earnest and sensible man—and<p></p>
        a decent parent.<p></p>
        That said, Itsuki's current situation really made Amane appreciate his relationship<p></p>
        with his own parents. They could be more than a little overbearing at times, but on<p></p>
        the whole, they respected their son's wishes, and Amane almost never argued with<p></p>
        them. After all, they had gone to a lot of trouble to send him to school far away from<p></p>
        his hometown. And they never gave him a hard time about who he associated with—<p></p>
        if anything, they fully supported him on that front.<p></p>
        Amane hadn't told his parents about his feelings toward Mahiru, but they were<p></p>
        obviously quite taken with her—even openly mentioning that she'd make a wonderful<p></p>
        daughter-in-law. If by some slim chance he did one day happen to find himself in that<p></p>
        sort of relationship with Mahiru, Amane was sure his parents would approve.<p></p>
        Amane was well aware that he was blessed with a loving family.<p></p>
        …Considering Mahiru's situation, I've seriously got it made, huh?<p></p>
        Amane fell into an uncomfortable silence as he recalled the chilling expression he'd<p></p>
        seen Mahiru's mother brandish, only for Itsuki to flash him a flippant grin. It seemed<p></p>
        like he had already regained his usual cheer.<p></p>
        "Well, my dad's not worth worrying about. Come on, let's check out the class lists."<p></p>
        "From the way you're smiling, I can more or less guess what got posted."<p></p>
        Amane shot Itsuki a weary look when he saw his friend's ordinary smile had become<p></p>
        a devious grin, then searched for his own name among the crowd of students who<p></p>
        were doing the same.<p></p>
        It didn't take him long to spot his name. As he started confirming who his classmates<p></p>
        would be for the year, Itsuki's impish smile began to make more sense.<p></p>
        There were many familiar names on the roll sheet.<p></p>
        Several belonged to students who had been in his class last year—namely, Itsuki and<p></p>
        the boy who was often referred to as the prince, Yuuta Kadowaki.<p></p>
        Amane also spied Chitose's name, which certainly explained Itsuki's good mood.<p></p>
        And there was one more he recognized.<p></p>
        Mahiru Shiina—the name of his next-door neighbor who always looked after him, the<p></p>
        secret object of his affections.<p></p>
        If I didn't know any better, I'd swear somebody planned it all out. 3<p></p>
        Of course, class assignments were decided by the school administration, meaning<p></p>
        Amane and his friends had no say where they ended up, but he never expected to be<p></p>
        placed with so many familiar faces.<p></p>
        "We got real lucky, didn't we, Amane?"<p></p>
        "I don't know what's so great about it. I guess it's a relief to have you with me."<p></p>
        "What's up, you getting embarrassed for once?"<p></p>
        "Shut it. And if anyone's lucky, it's gotta be you, right? Being in the same class as<p></p>
        Chitose and all."<p></p>
        "I really am, man. I was worried that they'd heartlessly tear us two lovers apart…"<p></p>
        "On second thought, maybe putting some distance between you two would've been<p></p>
        better for everybody."<p></p>
        With this excitable couple around, there wouldn't be a single moment of boredom—<p></p>
        or peace. And their constant displays of affection were almost guaranteed to bother<p></p>
        all the single students.<p></p>
        Amane was happy to be in the same class as his friends Itsuki and Chitose, but on the<p></p>
        other hand, he could already tell that this year was going to be turbulent and difficult.<p></p>
        "Why so harsh? Ah, don't tell me—it's because you're single, right?"<p></p>
        "Try saying that to the other guys. If looks could kill, man."<p></p>
        "I'm joking, I'm joking! But seriously, this turned out pretty great, yeah? You finally get<p></p>
        to be in the same class as the girl you like."<p></p>
        "…Shut up." Amane turned sharply away from Itsuki's teasing.<p></p>
        A cheerful voice interrupted their banter. "I could be wrong, but Fujimiya looks a little<p></p>
        pissed, doesn't he?" There was a quiet laugh. "He'll start to hate you if you tease him<p></p>
        too much, Itsuki."<p></p>
        Amane felt himself frown as he looked up and saw Yuuta, the class prince, standing<p></p>
        beside Itsuki with one hand resting on his shoulder.<p></p>
        It was impossible to miss the flickering glances gathering on him in the hallway. This<p></p>
        level of attention must have been completely normal to him, because he didn't seem<p></p>
        bothered in the slightest. Yuuta was just showing Amane a friendly smile.<p></p>
        "Morning. We're in the same class again this year. Looking forward to it."<p></p>
        It didn't seem like a very significant interaction. He had seen Itsuki and Amane<p></p>
        conversing by the bulletin board and had come over to greet them. Yuuta got along<p></p>
        okay with Itsuki, so that wasn't strange, but it was unusual for him to be so friendly<p></p>
        with Amane.<p></p>
        Amane felt a little uncomfortable talking with such a popular guy. There was nothing<p></p>
        wrong with Yuuta as a person, but Amane disliked attracting too much attention.<p></p>
        Besides, making new friends like this at the beginning of the new semester threatened<p></p>
        to remind him of the past. The pain welling up slowly but steadily from the deep<p></p>
        crevices of his chest was nostalgic. It was a feeling he thought he had buried a long<p></p>
        time ago.<p></p>
        "…Fujimiya?"<p></p>
        "Eh? Ah, sorry; I spaced out for a second. Hope we have a good year."<p></p>
        Amane smiled back weakly at Yuuta, who was now frowning slightly, looking worried<p></p>
        for a moment before finally letting his face soften into a relieved smile.<p></p>
        You should save a smile like that for your fangirls, Amane thought briefly. But Yuuta<p></p>
        looked genuinely happy, so Amane was also relieved.<p></p>
        At that point, a couple other boys came over, and Yuuta left to chat with them.<p></p>
        Itsuki, who had been silent until then, had his eyes fixed on Amane, as if he was<p></p>
        forming some conjecture. "Is it just me, or are you on your guard around Yuuta?"<p></p>
        "…No, that's not it. It's just… I was thinking how weird it is for him to try to be friends<p></p>
        with me."<p></p>
        "Really, dude? You're always way too hard on yourself. Look, it's not like Yuuta has<p></p>
        some ulterior motive for being friendly with you, ya know? Not everyone who acts<p></p>
        nice is looking to gain some advantage. You're one cagy guy, Amane."<p></p>
        "I'm sure that's true," Amane replied, "but—" The moment he noticed Itsuki glaring at<p></p>
        him with exasperation, he gulped back down the words he was going to say next. —<p></p>
        But there are people like that out there.<p></p>
        Not that he suspected Yuuta was one of them or anything.<p></p>
        They had only spent the past year as classmates in passing, but even so, Amane knew<p></p>
        that Yuuta was a good guy. With his kind, honest, charming personality, it was hardly<p></p>
        a mystery why the boy was popular, and no wonder he had lots of friends.<p></p>
        Still, this particular time of year brought back many unpleasant memories for Amane,<p></p>
        and it made him extra suspicious, even when he knew there was no reason to be.<p></p>
        "It doesn't really have anything to do with what kind of guy Kadowaki is. I'm just shy,<p></p>
        so I get spooked when someone suddenly wants to talk to me."<p></p>
        "Well, I guess that's fair. You are the shy type. The first time we talked, you got all<p></p>
        wound up like a nervous cat."<p></p>
        "Who're you calling a cat?"<p></p>
        "Tell me I'm wrong. Timid and quiet as could be as long as no one touched you, but the<p></p>
        moment someone made contact, bam, your hackles would be up."<p></p>
        Amane frowned at Itsuki's analogy. As a cat lover, he didn't appreciate his sulky<p></p>
        attitude being lumped in with such adorable, free-spirited creatures.<p></p>
        "Anyway, I think you'd get along with Yuuta if you gave him a chance. Since middle<p></p>
        school, we've been in the same class for three years, so I can vouch for him. He's a good<p></p>
        dude."<p></p>
        "I can tell that just by watching him, but it's my feelings that are the problem. Besides,<p></p>
        I've never really talked with him…"<p></p>
        "I'm pretty sure it won't be long before he changes that himself."<p></p>
        "Wait, why?"<p></p>
        "What do you mean? It's 'cause even Yuuta can tell you're a good guy."<p></p>
        Itsuki said that with another big grin, but Amane frowned reflexively. He simply didn't<p></p>
        understand.<p></p>
        "Mooorniiing! Looks like we're in the same class this year!"<p></p>
        After Amane entered his new classroom, found his assigned seat, and checked that<p></p>
        there were no mistakes in his school paperwork, Chitose approached him, looking like<p></p>
        she'd just gotten out of bed.<p></p>
        This year, both Chitose and Itsuki were in his class, so he knew this was only the first<p></p>
        of many boisterous and heartburn-inducing days.<p></p>
        "Good morning. You didn't come with Itsuki today, huh?"<p></p>
        "Yeah, I overslept. Honestly, I totally forgot about the new semester, and my mom had<p></p>
        to wake me up. Where's Itsuki?"<p></p>
        "He went to the vending machines a minute ago."<p></p>
        "Gotcha. Guess I'll message him and ask for a milk tea. Ah, Mahirun, Mahirun! We're in<p></p>
        the same class this year! I can't wait!"<p></p>
        Waving her hands excitedly, Chitose, who wasn't bashful around anyone, bounded over<p></p>
        to Mahiru, who had just entered the classroom. Mahiru, surrounded by a slew of boys<p></p>
        and girls, blinked in surprise. Everyone around her stiffened when they heard Chitose<p></p>
        address her so casually, but when Mahiru reacted normally and instantly donned her<p></p>
        angelic smile, it was clear that Chitose was permitted to talk to her that way. That was<p></p>
        when the crowd's mood changed to one of jealousy.<p></p>
        Watching Chitose rush over to Mahiru with so much energy that early in the morning<p></p>
        left Amane feeling equal parts frustration and admiration. When his gaze fell on Mahiru,<p></p>
        their eyes met for a moment, and he thought he saw a flicker of change in her soft<p></p>
        smile. But the next instant, she shifted her gaze back to Chitose with a tender look in<p></p>
        her eyes.<p></p>
        "Mahirun, school lets out early today, so let's go eat crepes on the way home! The crepe<p></p>
        place in front of the station is super tasty!"<p></p>
        "That sounds nice. I'd like to go if you really don't mind."<p></p>
        It might have been Amane's imagination, but he thought he saw her glance in his<p></p>
        direction again. As far as Amane was concerned, she certainly didn't need to get his<p></p>
        permission every time she wanted to go somewhere, and he had no intention of being<p></p>
        a burden who kept her from going out when she wanted. He could always eat fast food<p></p>
        or go to a convenience store for lunch. Mahiru was cultivating a budding friendship,<p></p>
        and Amane was happy for her.<p></p>
        Chitose was very good at connecting with people like that, so he hoped they would<p></p>
        have fun together—and that she would show Mahiru, who didn't typically hang out<p></p>
        with many other people, a good time without wearing her out too much.<p></p>
        Mahiru was probably the one who would benefit most from having Chitose in the same<p></p>
        class. She was already smiling happily, despite Chitose's intensity. Amane felt a smile<p></p>
        of his own slide into place.<p></p>
        The first day of the new semester consisted of an opening ceremony
        <p></p>
        then self-introductions and general announcements in the classroom. Once that was all over,<p></p>
        the students were dismissed.<p></p>
        Since school let out before lunchtime, Amane had been planning to eat with Mahiru, but<p></p>
        instead, he bought a boxed lunch from the convenience store he had come to rely on<p></p>
        less and less frequently. After getting home and devouring his basic meal, he sprawled<p></p>
        out lazily on the sofa.<p></p>
        Amane had many acquaintances in his new class, and from what he could tell, most of<p></p>
        the other students were on the calm side, so it seemed like he would be able to manage<p></p>
        one way or another. It was a huge relief to know so many of his classmates. It would<p></p>
        have been depressing to spend a year's worth of classes without even one friend.<p></p>
        Amane had enough self-awareness to understand he had a gloomy disposition, so he<p></p>
        expected it would be quite a hurdle to make new friends and get to know them. He<p></p>
        had a hard time trusting people in general.<p></p>
        While idly thinking about what a feat it was to have befriended Itsuki and lauding his<p></p>
        past self for his foresight, Amane slowly let his eyes slide shut.<p></p>
        Being in an unfamiliar classroom had been a bit taxing. Coupled with post-meal<p></p>
        sleepiness, it meant that Amane drifted off in no time.<p></p>
        For Amane, brushing up against the memories he had sealed away brought a small yet<p></p>
        sharp pain, like grazing a hangnail.<p></p>
        Normally, he was able to forget about them and chase them to the depths of his mind<p></p>
        by focusing on the many good things in his life.<p></p>
        Since meeting Mahiru, he had barely even thought about them anymore, and when the<p></p>
        memories did reappear, they were like bubbles that burst the moment they hit the<p></p>
        surface of the water. Those pinpricks only lingered briefly. The recent, sudden increase<p></p>
        might have been due to the new school year, or maybe it had been triggered when he<p></p>
        learned about Mahiru's past. Or possibly because he'd realized that Itsuki, who had<p></p>
        been his first new friend after everything had happened, was also buddies with Yuuta.<p></p>
        "Let's have a great year."<p></p>
        There had been another boy once who had said that and extended a hand to Amane.<p></p>
        At the time, Amane had been more trusting—and less wary of others. He had always<p></p>
        been surrounded by good people and never learned to recognize when someone<p></p>
        meant to hurt him.<p></p>
        And so he didn't doubt the boy. He didn't doubt any of them.<p></p>
        "—You… from the very start—"<p></p>
        Amane jolted awake, and the words he knew came next faded away.<p></p>
        Through blurry eyes, he could see spring sunlight streaming in through the window,<p></p>
        gently illuminating the dark, familiar apartment.<p></p>
        There was no one there except Amane and no sound other than his own breathing,<p></p>
        which was rougher than usual.<p></p>
        He let out a heavy sigh as he looked at the clock and noted that about an hour had<p></p>
        passed since he'd dozed off. A considerable nap, but Amane still felt completely<p></p>
        exhausted, probably because of his bad dreams.<p></p>
        Given how tired his body and mind felt, he could have easily gone to sleep again, but<p></p>
        he had suddenly lost any inclination to try and rest.<p></p>
        I should at least wash my face and clear my head.<p></p>
        Hoping that a little fresh water might wash away any lingering dregs of melancholy,<p></p>
        Amane headed for the sink.<p></p>
        "…You don't look so good, Amane."<p></p>
        Although he had washed up, the hazy feeling in Amane's chest hadn't cleared up. It had<p></p>
        only receded just enough for him to stow it in the depths of his heart and wait to forget<p></p>
        about it again. He thought he'd managed to wipe any traces of it from his expression<p></p>
        so he wouldn't arouse Mahiru's suspicions, but she was very perceptive and wouldn't<p></p>
        be fooled so easily. She had come by after her outing with Chitose, and when they had<p></p>
        settled down after dinner, she studied Amane's face and questioned him.<p></p>
        "…Are you feeling sick?"<p></p>
        "No, nothing like that… Uh, it's just that… I took a nap, but I had kind of a bad dream, I<p></p>
        guess."<p></p>
        "Oh, you had a nightmare?" She gave him an inquisitive look.<p></p>
        "Mm, sort of." Amane shook his head. "Not a big deal, really. No need to worry." It was<p></p>
        a thin excuse.<p></p>
        Mahiru is sharp. She'll leave it at that if it's clear that's what I want. She's the type to let<p></p>
        up if she knows I don't want to talk right now.<p></p>
        Amane didn't want to shut her out completely, but it was still a sore spot for him, so<p></p>
        he kept her at a bit of a distance. He knew Mahiru wouldn't press the issue.<p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to have sensed that Amane had no intention of opening up at the<p></p>
        moment, and she was simply staring intently at him with focused caramel-coloured<p></p>
        eyes. She clearly wasn't angry, or sad, or troubled. It made him feel a little awkward,<p></p>
        but Mahiru didn't stop staring, as if to say she understood what he was going through.<p></p>
        "What is it?"<p></p>
        "Nothing; just thinking that your hair looks especially soft."<p></p>
        "Huh?"<p></p>
        He had been on his guard, wondering what she was going to say next, so this sudden<p></p>
        non sequitur caught him by surprise. He had been anticipating an interrogation of<p></p>
        some sort, so the mention of his hair left him struggling to respond.<p></p>
        Mahiru was examining Amane's hair with her usual expression.<p></p>
        "Can I touch it?"<p></p>
        "What is this, all of a sudden…? I mean, you can if you like, but—"<p></p>
        "Oh really? In that case, come here."<p></p>
        Mahiru moved to the edge of the sofa and patted her lap.<p></p>
        Amane responded once more with, "Huh?"<p></p>
        He didn't understand.<p></p>
        "Put your head here so I can reach."<p></p>
        "No, no, no."<p></p>
        Mahiru stared quietly at Amane, who shook his head sharply at this incredibly unusual<p></p>
        development. Amane was extremely confused as to why she had suddenly proposed<p></p>
        such a thing. Mahiru, on the other hand, seemed perfectly calm, which only heightened<p></p>
        his confusion.<p></p>
        "Is there something wrong with my lap?"<p></p>
        "N-no, that's not—"<p></p>
        He quickly shook his head when he detected the displeasure in her voice.<p></p>
        The opportunity to rest your head in the lap of the person you like is a rare moment<p></p>
        of exceptional good luck.<p></p>
        But whether he should simply go along and accept the favor was a different question<p></p>
        entirely. No matter how much physical contact they'd had before, laying his head in<p></p>
        her lap was a whole new level of intimacy. There was a good chance he would die of<p></p>
        embarrassment. Their hug the other day had been urgent and for the sake of soothing<p></p>
        and comforting Mahiru, so he hadn't felt too self-conscious then, but this was a whole<p></p>
        other matter.<p></p>
        "It's fine; just get over here already."<p></p>
        "N-no, that's…"<p></p>
        "Amane."<p></p>
        "…Fine."<p></p>
        He had been trying to resist, but his willpower crumbled the moment Mahiru called his<p></p>
        name with a smile. Her latent powers of persuasion revealed themselves once again<p></p>
        as she invitingly smoothed the fabric of her skirt, wiping out all remaining pockets of<p></p>
        resistance.<p></p>
        Thank goodness she's wearing a long skirt, he thought from the bottom of his heart as<p></p>
        he hesitantly went to lie down on the sofa to rest his head in Mahiru's lap. He had his<p></p>
        back to her, looking out over her knees, as he felt the firm softness of her thighs.<p></p>
        Her slim legs, lean but still undeniably feminine, supported the weight of his head<p></p>
        perfectly. Her lap was at just the right height, and he could smell her faint, sweet scent<p></p>
        and feel the heat of her body. The last of his willpower dissolved as she brought a hand<p></p>
        down and gently brushed his cheek.<p></p>
        "What would you do if I did something really rude while I was down here?" he muttered<p></p>
        in a brusque voice, making his final attempt to put up a fight.<p></p>
        He heard a quiet laugh.<p></p>
        "I guess I would stand right up and then stomp on you."<p></p>
        "Sorry I asked."<p></p>
        Recently, Mahiru had been a bit more reserved, so hearing her tease him after so long<p></p>
        was almost nostalgic. Amane apologized right away, in case the threat was serious, but<p></p>
        Mahiru was smiling in amusement at Amane's reaction.<p></p>
        "Well, I know you wouldn't do anything like that. You don't seem to have the courage<p></p>
        or the energy."<p></p>
        He had some complicated feelings about being called a coward so casually, but the truth<p></p>
        was that he did not, in fact, have the nerve to try anything because he thought Mahiru<p></p>
        would hate him if he did, so she wasn't exactly wrong.<p></p>
        "Well, why don't you just relax instead? It'll be easier to reach you if you settle down."<p></p>
        Amane didn't have much reason to refuse as she gently ran her white fingers through<p></p>
        his black hair, so he kept his mouth shut.<p></p>
        …She must be worried about me.<p></p>
        This was probably Mahiru's way of cheering him up.<p></p>
        Amane guessed that she realized he was feeling stressed lately and decided to help<p></p>
        him decompress. He wasn't sure why her first thought was that it would be relaxing<p></p>
        for him to lie down on her lap like this, but it was actually surprisingly comfortable, so<p></p>
        he wasn't going to complain. And his heart wasn't pounding as hard as he'd expected,<p></p>
        possibly because he was so worn out.<p></p>
        A pleasant drowsiness washed over him. He had no idea it could feel so nice to have<p></p>
        someone gently comb their fingers through his hair. It had been a long time since he<p></p>
        had been spoiled by someone like this, and he wasn't sure what, if anything, he should<p></p>
        do. He could feel himself sinking gradually into a deep sea of happiness and<p></p>
        contentment. It probably wouldn't be long before he was on the cusp of sleep.<p></p>
        Just as soft slumber was about to completely overtake him, Amane heard Mahiru say,<p></p>
        "Well, doesn't the young gentleman have a single thing to say about what it's like to lay<p></p>
        his head in a young lady's lap?"<p></p>
        His eyes snapped open as he exhaled sharply.<p></p>
        "Ah, well, see—"<p></p>
        "I heard from Chitose that when a boy is tired, if you let him lie down on your lap, it's<p></p>
        like a dream come true and should help him feel better."<p></p>
        Amane now realized he had Chitose's meddling to thank for this unusual bit of intimacy.<p></p>
        Though, he couldn't honestly say she'd been completely off the mark. Actually, he<p></p>
        really ought to thank her.<p></p>
        Amane pursed his lips as he thought about how he should answer Mahiru's question.<p></p>
        While he ruminated, she kept tapping his cheek with her finger.<p></p>
        Frankly, it was the greatest feeling ever, and he wished he could enjoy it every day. But<p></p>
        he was worried if he said that, she would be disgusted or taken aback, so he didn't say<p></p>
        anything at all.<p></p>
        He couldn't be completely honest, but on the other hand, he had to say something nice.<p></p>
        He was being pampered here, so he couldn't lie and claim it wasn't all that special.<p></p>
        However, he could practically envision himself saying something dumb and blunt that<p></p>
        would drive her away.<p></p>
        After puzzling over it for a few moments, Amane decided to respond with some mild<p></p>
        praise.<p></p>
        "…I think it's really great. But don't take that to mean anything weird." 1<p></p>
        "How can I when it's the first time I've done it?"<p></p>
        Amane couldn't keep his heart from leaping at the words first time. He remembered<p></p>
        that she didn't like getting too close to boys and really avoided most physical contact<p></p>
        altogether. Of course he would be the first.<p></p>
        When he realized how much Mahiru must trust him to let him get so close, Amane felt<p></p>
        his chest and face grow hot. But Mahiru didn't seem to notice and simply kept running<p></p>
        her fingers through his hair with an air of satisfaction.<p></p>
        "Well, it's something I wanted to try, so you just sit back and relax. I'm only petting you<p></p>
        anyway."<p></p>
        "…I guess."<p></p>
        Mahiru emphasized that she was just doing as she pleased, so he didn't need to hold<p></p>
        back or be anxious. Feeling a bit sheepish about it all, Amane decided to take Mahiru<p></p>
        up on her offer.<p></p>
        "…Amane, what do you think of our class this year?"<p></p>
        She had played with his hair in silence for a little while before casually posing the<p></p>
        question.<p></p>
        "Hmm, well, I never thought we'd end up in the same class."<p></p>
        He'd been hoping to have at least one friend in his class, but it hadn't occurred to him<p></p>
        that everyone could end up together.<p></p>
        "Heh-heh. It was fun to see you so stunned."<p></p>
        "Hey… But yeah, it definitely caught me by surprise. I'll have to be vigilant."<p></p>
        "What do you mean?"<p></p>
        "I'll need to keep my distance so I don't speak to you too casually or act overly familiar."<p></p>
        On the one hand, Amane felt relieved that his friends would be nearby, but on the other<p></p>
        hand, since Mahiru was there, he would have to be careful about how they interacted.<p></p>
        He would avoid talking to her whenever he could, but if he slipped up and let on that<p></p>
        they were close, it would probably become a huge spectacle.<p></p>
        In spite of his feelings, he didn't want to be indiscreet about his relationship with<p></p>
        Mahiru at school. As far as Amane was concerned, as long as they could spend time<p></p>
        together at home, that was fine by him. He had no desire to go out of his way to make<p></p>
        enemies out of most of the boys at school.<p></p>
        As long as people didn't know about their relationship, they wouldn't try to talk to<p></p>
        him. He planned on acting like the two of them were strangers. Thinking that surely<p></p>
        Mahiru must understand, he let his eyes close—but she pinched his cheek between<p></p>
        her fingers.<p></p>
        "…What's wrong?"<p></p>
        "…Oh, nothing. I understand your logic, but I couldn't let it slide without doing anything,<p></p>
        so…"<p></p>
        "What's that supposed to mean…?"<p></p>
        She seemed very sulky for some reason, but there was nothing Amane could do. He<p></p>
        surmised that she wanted the two of them to talk like they always did, even at school.<p></p>
        After all, she could relax around him. But she wasn't the one who'd end up in trouble.<p></p>
        If Amane had been a popular and attractive guy—like Itsuki, for example—then maybe<p></p>
        the two of them could hang out whenever and wherever they wanted. But since Amane<p></p>
        was not popular or even sociable, it was a different story entirely.<p></p>
        It wasn't hard to imagine that there might be people who would decide that Amane<p></p>
        wasn't worthy of the angel's attention and hound him.<p></p>
        Amane was accustomed to being alone. What he didn't need was the ire of his classmates.<p></p>
        "…Well, I'll go along with it… for now," Mahiru said eventually.<p></p>
        "I dunno how I feel about that 'for now'…but it's a start."<p></p>
        "We'll still act normal at home, though, right?"<p></p>
        "Of course… But if we're going to act normal, shouldn't I get out of your lap?"<p></p>
        "This doesn't count."<p></p>
        Mahiru announced this strange exception and brushed Amane's hair again. Or rather,<p></p>
        she played with it like she was kneading it. Amane knew that if he said anything more,<p></p>
        Mahiru would pout again, and as long as he kept his mouth shut, he could keep savoring<p></p>
        this blissful moment. It was an easy decision.<p></p>
        Maybe because she was pleased by Amane's silent and docile reception, Mahiru<p></p>
        started arranging his hair more deliberately.<p></p>
        Her movements were gentle and affectionate, as well as a little awkward, but Amane<p></p>
        submitted to the comforting sensation, and it wasn't long before he was utterly at her<p></p>
        mercy.<p></p>
        …I'm really being spoiled…<p></p>
        If she kept this up, he would without a doubt sink into the deepest of slumbers. He felt<p></p>
        his eyes start to drift closed again as he basked in Mahiru's warmth, and another wave<p></p>
        of sleepiness washed over him. Truly, there was no defying the lulling power of the<p></p>
        angel's lap. 1<p></p>
        He resisted the urge to roll over toward her and burrow into the inviting warmth and<p></p>
        surround himself with her smell. He knew that if he did that, there would be no turning<p></p>
        back, so he deliberately kept his back to her, just barely holding his ground.<p></p>
        As Mahiru continued stroking his head affectionately, he began to feel heavy, and after<p></p>
        another moment of resistance, he finally surrendered to the irresistible comfort.<p></p>
        "…You look sleepy."<p></p>
        He heard her quiet murmur but no longer had the energy to lift his eyelids.<p></p>
        "It's all right; I'll wake you up in a bit. Go ahead and rest."<p></p>
        As he listened to her soft whispers, Amane could no longer stay awake and quickly<p></p>
        yielded to the embrace of the sandman.<p></p>
        When he lifted his heavy eyelids, Amane was looking up at two mountains covered by<p></p>
        a blouse, and beyond that, Mahiru's face, wearing a tender expression. He immediately<p></p>
        sat up, eyes wide with surprise.<p></p>
        Apparently, he had turned over at some point in his sleep to face the ceiling. Because<p></p>
        of that, he had been greeted with a rather bracing view upon waking, and his heart<p></p>
        was thumping strangely.<p></p>
        "…How long was I out for?"<p></p>
        At this question, Mahiru let slip a faint smile.<p></p>
        "About an hour. You look so cute when you're sleeping."<p></p>
        "Don't stare at me, geez."<p></p>
        "You're one to talk."<p></p>
        He had attempted to rebuke Mahiru for her teasing, but she immediately turned the<p></p>
