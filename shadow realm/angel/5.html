        Semester exams had finally ended. Having survived their collective hell, the students<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gathered in their classroom, more exited and animated than usual.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane and Itsuki, both relieved that they had wrapped up all their tests, were<p></p>
        <p></p>
        comparing their performances.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm? Oh, pretty average," Amane answered. "Not that great, not that bad."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The exam had covered the expected material, so for anyone who studied daily, it wasn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that difficult. Amane had done about as well this time as he had with other tests,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        leaving little to say about his academics one way or the other.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane got bored easily, but he nevertheless always made sure to study. He was able<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to retain most of the things taught in class, but it was far too difficult to get a perfect<p></p>
        <p></p>
        score, so his scores usually floated between a solid eighty and ninety.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I bet you'll make it into the top thirty, if you didn't outdo yourself… you egghead,"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki teased.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's because I study every day," Amane shot back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, how nice for you!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't start; you're the one forgetting to study 'cause you're too busy flirting."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The difference between Amane and Itsuki probably had less to do with their intellectual<p></p>
        <p></p>
        capacities and more to do with which one of them spent all their free time with a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        certain girlfriend named Chitose. Itsuki had the ability to make it into a pretty high<p></p>
        <p></p>
        score bracket if he ever bothered to study seriously, but since Chitose was his real<p></p>
        <p></p>
        priority, his actual rank was much lower than Amane's.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Girlfriends are great, you know?" Itsuki said wistfully.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, yeah."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, Amane, you should get a girlfriend, too!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If guys could just get girlfriends whenever they wanted, the men of the world<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wouldn't shed so many bitter tears."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There were plenty of unsatisfied men who would have taken offense at Itsuki's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thoughtless remark. Amane, though, wasn't really inclined to get angry with him over<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it. In fact, he'd never really felt that way about any girl, so he was content to let the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        comment pass.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Assuming I did get one, what then?" Amane inquired.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "A double date," Itsuki replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That would end in a bad case of heartburn for my fictional girlfriend and me. We'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have to break up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You could flirt in front of us, too, y'know!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Do you really think I can find a girlfriend, the way I live?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I guess it's impossible."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was honest to a fault, even with himself. He'd always found other people difficult<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and exhausting, and he was aware that many people found him to be standoffish. That,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        plus the blunt way he spoke, meant he was not all that popular. Amane's social status<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would've made it hard to find a girlfriend, even if he was looking for one.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Against all odds, if Amane did somehow find a girlfriend, he was sure they wouldn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        be like Itsuki and Chitose. He couldn't picture himself flirting in public with a girl,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        oblivious to anyone who might see.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come on, you should at least find someone you like, Amane. If you just cut your bangs<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a little shorter, cleaned yourself up, and maybe found a style that worked for you, the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        girls would definitely look at you differently, I'm tellin' ya."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Assuming Amane's self-evaluation was accurate, he didn't have the handsome looks<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of a pretty boy like Yuuta or a Romeo like Itsuki, but he definitely didn't think he was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ugly, either. Amane figured that if he just spent more time on his grooming and paid<p></p>
        <p></p>
        more attention to his clothes, he could rival most of the other boys his age. The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        problem was that he didn't know enough about fashion to dress well, and he was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        certainly not smooth enough with his words to win any girl over.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not interested in the kind of girl who picks a date based on appearance," Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        asserted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You say that, but if you don't get them interested in the first place, you won't even get<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to know them well enough to judge their personality, right?" Itsuki argued back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Even if that's true, I'm not really looking for a girlfriend right now."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Were some hypothetical girl ever actually interested in Amane, it would be all over the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        second she saw how he lived. Amane was a slob with no life skills, and on top of that,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he had a difficult time getting along with other people. If there was a girl who was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        drawn to him, despite all that, he'd like to meet her. Such a hopeless thought was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        enough to bring a bitter smile to Amane's face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Besides, since Mahiru was cooking dinners for him now, a girlfriend could introduce<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some unpleasant complications. Not that Amane intended to pursue a relationship in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the first place, but that was simply one more strike against the idea.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane felt that Mahiru's delicious cooking was worth more than the possibility of an<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as-yet-unseen girlfriend, and that conviction was not likely to be easily overturned.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ugh, you're so boring… How about I get Chi to introduce you to one of her friends?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        offered Itsuki.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You care way too much about this. Most of Chi's friends are too… excitable. It's hard<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for me to hang out with them, even as friends." Amane quickly shot down the idea.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Only because you're so gloomy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, shut up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, if you say so, I won't say anything to her for now. But as a blossoming high school<p></p>
        <p></p>
        boy, isn't it sad to live an empty life, all by yourself?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't need a girlfriend; they're too much trouble."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Just what do you think we're supposed to be doing at school anyway? Amane thought.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even if he wasn't actually that serious about his studies, he still didn't see the point in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        spending so much time worrying about romance. Above all, finding a real match was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        no easy feat.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…What a waste," Itsuki grumbled.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, yeah." Amane shrugged.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But listen, you'll change your tune when you find a good one, Amane, ya hear?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What makes you so sure?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Because girls particularly like to fuss over guys like you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Whatever you say, man."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane couldn't imagine acting so sentimental; it didn't seem possible. He decided to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        simply ignore his friend's words. Itsuki was looking at Amane with an exasperated<p></p>
        <p></p>
        glare, when suddenly, his line of sight shifted, and his face relaxed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Itsukiii! Let's go home together!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, Chi!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Just then, Chitose appeared. Apparently, Itsuki had promised to walk her home, which<p></p>
        <p></p>
        brought a swift end to their conversation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Amane turned to see where his friend's attention had shifted, he saw a girl with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        medium-short light-brown hair tinged with red, looking their way with a radiant<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smile. Well, to be more accurate, she was only looking and waving at Itsuki.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The girl's lively aura and bright, smiling face were enough to make Itsuki beam<p></p>
        <p></p>
        whenever he saw her. That was the kind of effect Chitose had on people, and for better<p></p>
        <p></p>
        or worse, she was always the center of attention.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose was a different type of beauty than Mahiru. She had a great big smile as she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        rushed over. With any luck, she wouldn't have much to say today, because usually<p></p>
        <p></p>
        whenever Chitose talked, she made fun of Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You agree, right, Chi? Amane's the type of guy who needs a girlfriend to take care of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him, don't you think?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong," chided Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Wait, what, do you have a girlfriend, Amane?!" Chitose exclaimed excitedly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No way."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Aw, bummer," Chitose said, pouting. "If you did, I'd want to be friends with her."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Knowing your idea of friendship, I would feel bad for my imaginary girlfriend,"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, so you have an imaginary girlfriend?" Chitose asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Weren't we just talking about what if I had one?!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Kidding, kidding."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I get tired just talking to you…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's just because you don't have the stamina to handle me."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't have the patience, more like…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even a short exchange with Chitose was mentally exhausting for Amane. Most of the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        time, he tried to keep his head down and avoid other people, like at school. When he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        found himself forced to carry on a conversation with someone as extroverted as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose, it was really demanding.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose didn't let Amane's sour attitude bother her at all and flashed the
        <p></p>
        exhausted-looking boy a truly joyful-looking smile. "You're such a mess."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki smiled in the same way and tossed out some perfunctory advice. "You'd better<p></p>
        <p></p>
        get your act together, buddy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was already too worn-out, managing only to let out a deep sigh.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…What are you doing?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After returning home and gobbling up Mahiru's handmade food, Amane returned to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the living room once he was finished doing the dishes and saw Mahiru with a question<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sheet spread out before her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There'd been no agreement about cleaning the dishes, but Amane took the initiative<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to shoulder the burden whenever possible. While he'd been tidying up, Mahiru had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gone to sit in the living room. It would have been inexcusable to make her do<p></p>
        <p></p>
        everything and then hurry on home.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm grading," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, I can see that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She seemed to be reviewing her answers with her textbook out, checking that she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hadn't gotten anything wrong.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So what's the result?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, if I didn't make any recording errors on my answer sheet, then it's… a perfect<p></p>
        <p></p>
        score."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I can't think of anything to say except 'It figures.'"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Just as Mahiru didn't show much of a reaction in regard to her errorless work, Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        didn't have a very exaggerated response. He wasn't surprised, because her name was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        practically always written in the top spot of the periodic exam results. He knew Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was more than capable of a perfect score, so he was not the least bit surprised by her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        performance here.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's because studying doesn't bother me. I've actually already completed all of this<p></p>
        <p></p>
        year's coursework, so now it's enough to simply review," Mahiru explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Whoa, you really go all out…," Amane replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You study a lot yourself, Fujimiya."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You know what my grades are like?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I sort of remember your name in the ranking list."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, Mahiru had known a little bit about Amane before they ever spoke. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        must have noticed him among the top ranks, because she recounted his exact placement<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on the most recent test without hesitation, almost like she was looking at the list right<p></p>
        <p></p>
        now.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane did work pretty hard at his studies, but it wasn't because of some earnest drive<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for success or anything. It was because of an agreement he'd come to with his parents.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In order to live alone, he had to maintain good grades.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, it's a condition for my current lifestyle: I have to keep my grades up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The only other facet to the agreement was that Amane had to visit home at least once<p></p>
        <p></p>
        every six months, but he could take care of that over long school breaks. Basically, as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        long as he was keeping his grades up, there were no problems.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I study hard enough to keep my head above water, but nothing like you. You really put<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a lot of effort in."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I have to try hard," Mahiru mumbled, casting her eyes downward. Her expression<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was hidden by her bangs, and while Amane couldn't get a proper look at it, anyone<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would have recognized it wasn't a happy one. Before he could get a read on her, though,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she quickly looked back up, once again wearing her usual expression.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even if there had been time to point out the curious change, Amane probably wouldn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have. He could tell that Mahiru was carrying some kind of painful burden by certain<p></p>
        <p></p>
        things she did or faces she made.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        While Amane made sure to never ask Mahiru what was bothering her or what was so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        unpleasant, he still got the impression that she was struggling with something. Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        imagined that, whatever it was, it had its origins in her home life. It was hardly the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        kind of subject he could just casually broach with the girl. He understood that this was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        not an area in which an outsider like himself could intrude, and so Amane never<p></p>
        <p></p>
        touched the subject, and he persistently tried to maintain a sense of distance<p></p>
        <p></p>
        appropriate for a neighbor.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Everyone had things they didn't want to talk about, even Amane. Treading thoughtlessly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on Mahiru would be rude, and he was sure that she appreciated the fact that he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pretended not to notice her distress.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Having disguised her abrupt change in mood, Mahiru declared in a clear voice that she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would be heading back to her own apartment. She put her textbook and her answer<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sheet back into her bag.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane didn't have any intention of stopping her, so he replied simply "Mm-hmm,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sounds good" and watched Mahiru get ready to leave.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When the angel had finished putting everything away, she stood up from her seat, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane noticed that she'd left something behind next to her empty cup. He picked it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        up and discovered it was a case holding Mahiru's student ID, the kind any student<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would have. She'd probably pulled it out along with her textbook and forgotten to put<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Along with her name and picture, the little plastic card displayed common<p></p>
        <p></p>
        information, like her student number, birthday, and blood type. After staring at it for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a second, Amane called out to Mahiru, who was in the entryway and putting her shoes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You forgot this," he said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, sorry for the trouble. Well then, good night."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Night."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru gave a quick, polite bow and turned her back on Amane's apartment. With a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        small sigh, Amane watched her leave.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Thinking back to the birth date listed on Mahiru's school ID, Amane put a hand to his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        forehead as he realized something.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…That's in four days, isn't it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If he hadn't unintentionally seen the girl's ID, he likely never would've found out.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wished that he'd known about Mahiru's birthday a little earlier and let out<p></p>
        <p></p>
        another sigh, a deep one.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, I was wondering, is there anything you want?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The following day, Amane tried to see if there was anything Mahiru might like as a gift.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was no ulterior motive behind the gesture. In fact, Amane had been thinking for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a while that it might be nice to get something for the girl who had been taking care of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him every day. A birthday seemed like the perfect time.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There must have been something odd about the way Amane phrased the question,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        however, because Mahiru gave him a puzzled look. One that made Amane begin to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        regret asking such a direct question.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Why are you asking all of the sudden?" Mahiru inquired.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You don't seem very materialistic, so I was just curious."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Out of nowhere again…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane thought that he should probably have tried to play it a little smoother, but it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was too late for that now. The one possible saving grace was that Mahiru didn't seem<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to have realized that this was about her birthday. As far as she knew, Amane should've<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had no way of knowing her date of birth. Hopefully, that would keep her from catching<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, let's see, there is one thing I need. I guess that's what I want right now."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What do you want?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "A whetstone."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "A… whetstone?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Unconsciously, Amane repeated Mahiru's words, because the girl's answer had been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        far too unexpected.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        No one could've expected that kind of answer from a high school girl. Normally, you'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        think they would want cosmetics, or accessories, or bags, or something like that, Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thought. He would never in his wildest dreams have expected a girl to want a tool for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sharpening metal.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's right, a whetstone. I already have several, but I want one with a finer finishing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        surface, you see," Mahiru explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Are you sure you're really an ordinary high school girl?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Please don't expect me to be ordinary."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was difficult for Amane to object to that. Mahiru could not be called an ordinary high<p></p>
        <p></p>
        schooler, by any standard. Describing her as an angel seemed entirely accurate.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was a prodigy who was good at school and sports. What's more, she was an<p></p>
        <p></p>
        excellent cook and a skilled housekeeper. As if that wasn't enough, Mahiru was a noble<p></p>
        <p></p>
        young lady who spent so much time taking care of a slob like Amane that she could've<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been mistaken for a married woman.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Still, who could have imagined she'd want something like a whetstone?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had to be the only high school girl in the whole world who wanted such a thing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You can't buy it yourself?" Amane wondered aloud. She was well-off, after all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's not exactly that I can't buy it, you know. It's just—I won't have that many<p></p>
        <p></p>
        opportunities to use it, and it's pretty expensive. After considering all that, I couldn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        really justify the purchase. I already have one that can put a decent edge on, so I keep<p></p>
        <p></p>
        telling myself that I don't really need it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had to admit that it was more than a bit frightening to know that Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        owned several whetstones already.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…How many high school girls out there sharpen their own kitchen knives?" he asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Quite a few," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Even if there are, you're the only one I know, and you're also the only one who wants<p></p>
        <p></p>
        another whetstone."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I suppose it's nice to be unique."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If you say so…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        This certainly was an angel with unusual interests. Amane couldn't make heads or tails<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru tilted her head in confusion as Amane stood there looking baffled. He'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        completely lost sight of his original objective.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, Itsuki?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After completely failing to decide on a gift that Mahiru might appreciate, Amane had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        decided instead to consult with his best friend. Itsuki had a way with women's hearts,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as well as a girlfriend to consult, so Amane expected that he would probably have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some grasp on what a girl would normally want. While he wasn't really sure it was a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        good idea to try to apply normal standards to someone like Mahiru, he expected that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she wouldn't outright hate things that made someone else's girlfriend happy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What's up?" Itsuki replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "When you give Chitose presents, what do you usually get her?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane thought it would be best to start by asking what Itsuki bought for his girl, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        all he got back was a blank stare.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh, you planning on giving a present to some sweetheart of yours?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Do you think I have it in me to do something like that?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nope."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, then."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "In that case, why are you asking?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Someone I know has a birthday coming up, so I wanted to ask you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        While Amane was planning on listening to Itsuki's advice with the utmost attention,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he was also keen not to reveal too much about his own circumstances.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm… for starters, you should try finding out what they want. You know, it's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        important to do that sort of research on a regular basis. It's the secret to a harmonious<p></p>
        <p></p>
        relationship, I'm telling you," said Itsuki.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I told you that this isn't for a girlfriend," Amane reminded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Setting aside the potential grave danger the other boys at school would pose to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's physical safety if word ever got around, Mahiru was too awe-inspiring to even<p></p>
        <p></p>
        consider asking out in the first place.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Sure, he was comfortable hanging around with her, and they got along well enough as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        two frank individuals, but there were absolutely no romantic feelings between them.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Sure, she was cute, but that didn't mean Amane wanted a relationship.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What they want, huh…? And what if you don't know?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Depends on how close you are. If you're good friends, an accessory or something is<p></p>
        <p></p>
        good, but if you're not close, something practical that they can use is a safer bet. There<p></p>
        <p></p>
        are lots of girls who're happy to get flowers but don't know what to do when they<p></p>
        <p></p>
        receive them," Itsuki explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You sure know your stuff."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I've done a fair bit of research, I guess."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki and Chitose hadn't always been so wild about each other. Their relationship had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        slowly developed, first starting in middle school. Amane had gone to a different middle<p></p>
        <p></p>
        school, so he didn't really know all the details, but apparently, they'd gone through a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        lot together, and their relationship had grown from those experiences to the point<p></p>
        <p></p>
        where these days, they wouldn't shut up about each other.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        To hear him tell it, Itsuki had also been fairly lost the first time he'd had to give Chitose<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a present, so Amane figured he could benefit from his friend's experience.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, and no girl hates hand cream," Itsuki added.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hand cream?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Amane was pondering this unexpected option, Itsuki grinned and explained<p></p>
        <p></p>
        proudly, "No matter what age they are, every girl has some use for it. If she's a student,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her hands get dry from handling notebooks and textbooks in class; if she's in the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        workforce, her hands dry out from typing and air conditioning; and housewives cook<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and clean, so their hands take a beating, too. You can't go wrong with that stuff."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm. You sure know an awful lot about women's hands…," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're the one who came and asked me!" Itsuki snapped.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki slapped Amane on the back, but there was no power behind it. The two friends<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shared a laugh.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Hand cream, huh? I guess that is a pretty safe bet.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had been taking the initiative on washing the dishes after dinner, but Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        obviously did her own dishes at home, so he could imagine her hands could use some<p></p>
        <p></p>
        moisturizing. More importantly, Amane was sure she took care of her hands already,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        since they were so smooth. A gift she could use right away really was the best plan.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Cool, thanks for your thoughts," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Let's try asking Chi, too. As a fellow girl, she probably has a better idea," proposed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Eh…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You gotta warm up to her."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane certainly didn't hate her, but Chitose was not exactly his favorite type of girl,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and being around her always made him feel awkward. Usually, he tried to avoid<p></p>
        <p></p>
        interacting with her altogether. Itsuki slapped Amane's back again gently, smiling in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        amusement.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Whaaa—? Amane, you're giving a girl a birthday present?" Chitose was smiling—no,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smirking—at this rare development, and it was all Amane could do not to grimace.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He had gone to Chitose's classroom to talk to her after school, and sure enough, she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seemed greatly amused. Incidentally, Itsuki had sent Chitose a message saying that he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wasn't worried about her being alone with another boy as long as it was Amane, so he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had gone on home. Amane had sighed softly, while Chitose had worn a wide grin.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I told him I didn't want to ask her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was obvious that she was definitely going to pry and ridicule him, so he hadn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        intended to turn to her for help at all. Amane certainly didn't hate Chitose, but he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        couldn't deny that there were some things about her that he just couldn't stand.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Okay, so Itsuki wrote here that 'Amane was hoping you'd give him some pointers.' So<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you want my help, huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're the only girl I can ask, Chi."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It doesn't sound very nice when you put it like that, you know." Chitose looked at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane with clear pity, but he let it pass.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The truth was, Amane had no female friends outside of Chitose. Every single girl in his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        class barely counted as acquaintances, and he wasn't close enough to any of them to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        be able to ask for help with things like this.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Actually, Amane was usually rather quiet in school. If one of his female classmates<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tried to talk to him, he probably wouldn't know what to do.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right, well, I can't imagine you really understand how girls think, Amane. But don't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        worry! Miss Chitose is here to advise you!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I guess I'm in your hands," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You guess? What's to guess? I may not look it, but I know women's hearts perfectly!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, you are a girl, after all… I guess."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Watch it with those guesses, buddy! I'm not sure I like what you're implying!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose cleared her throat and thrust out her chest. Compared to Mahiru, who Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        saw every day, the result was underwhelming at best. Amane awkwardly stared at the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ground.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Regardless of what he personally thought, Chitose was popular with guys.
        <p></p>
        Personality wise, she was cheerful and friendly, and she talked to everyone without playing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        favorites, so hers was a different kind of popularity than Mahiru's. She got along with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        boys and girls alike. She really was the epitome of a life-of-the-party kind of person.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She had apparently been a member of the track-and-field club in middle school, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her slender build and toned legs certainly didn't hurt her popularity. It was a verifiable<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fact that her legs were beautiful, so much so that Itsuki had warned other guys in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        school that he'd get angry if they stared at her too much.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, right, right," Chitose chittered. "Something for a cute girl, let's see…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There were definitely times when she got too friendly, but Amane wouldn't deny that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose was cute. He could understand why other guys in school liked her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You know," Chitose added, "that glum attitude of yours is seriously gonna give<p></p>
        <p></p>
        people the wrong idea."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Gee, thanks for your concern," Amane replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Fine, fine. So you're giving something to a girl, right? Well, what kind of girl?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose's question didn't leave him much room to maneuver, but Amane knew that if<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he was careless with what he told her, she wouldn't let him live it down, so he chose<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his words gingerly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "She's an acquaintance of mine, and she's relatively young. Beyond that, I'm exercising<p></p>
        <p></p>
        my right to remain silent."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh… if you won't tell me her about her personality or what she likes, even I can't come<p></p>
        <p></p>
        up with any ideas, you know."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Can't you just tell me some things that you would like to get as a gift? Then I'll choose<p></p>
        <p></p>
        from among them."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I get it; you don't want to tell me anything about her. Fine, we'll do it your way."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose made a good point, but if he told her any more, she would know that Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was close to a girl their age, and it was likely that the conversation would veer off in a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        strange and uncomfortable direction from there. If he really slipped up, Chitose might<p></p>
        <p></p>
        even end up figuring out that he was talking about Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wanted to avoid that if at all possible, so he'd decided not to tell her anything<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that wasn't strictly necessary. Chitose also seemed to understand that he wouldn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        willingly reveal much more, and thankfully, she was kind enough to back off on the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        questions.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm, let's see… I don't know what type of relationship you have with her, but if she's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        an acquaintance you speak with fairly often, I'm assuming she would be happy to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        receive something from a person who's about as close to her as I am to you. In that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        case, generally a consumable or everyday item that's not too expensive should be good."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Itsuki told me pretty much the same thing," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Obviously. He understands how girls think. Now, if you're looking for a casual gift,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some sweets and a handkerchief or some small item might be good. If I got an<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expensive accessory from you, Amane, I'd totally be like 'A bribe?!' or something."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't think I would get anything out of bribing you, though."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After shooting Amane a glance that seemed to be asking for some sort of recompense<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for her help, Chitose smiled and answered, "Well, you've got that right. Anyway, little<p></p>
        <p></p>
        things like that are safe."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Gotcha."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You sound kinda unsatisfied." Chitose cocked her head.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's not that I'm not satisfied, but…" Amane trailed off. In truth, he just wasn't sure<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that Mahiru would appreciate the sort of gift that he would select. She probably had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        impeccable taste, and she seemed like the type to choose things that combined quality<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and functionality. Amane wasn't sure if his choice would measure up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose could sense a slight hesitation in Amane's demeanor, and she hummed a bit to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        herself. "…Let's see… Another option might be… something cute?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Such as?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Depends on the person's tastes. For example, a stuffed animal or a keychain with an<p></p>
        <p></p>
        adorable character on it. I think giving her something like that might work."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane blinked back at Chitose after hearing the unexpected suggestion, and Chitose<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smiled knowingly. "Most girls enjoy cute things, you see. There are even some people<p></p>
        <p></p>
        who keep collecting stuffed animals long after they grow up, and lots of girls like them<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in general, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…A stuffed animal, huh…?" Amane didn't know whether Mahiru had any girly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        interests, but she did wear clothes decorated with cute frills and ornaments, so she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        probably didn't hate cuter things like stuffed animals.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could certainly imagine Mahiru being happy to receive a plush toy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, do I sense some interest?" Chitose smirked. Apparently, she had caught the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        minute change that had come over Amane. He nodded, though he was still unsure, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        let out a small sigh.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…But it'll be too weird for me to buy a stuffed animal, I think," Amane admitted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's a present; you're not buying it for yourself. What's the problem?" Chitose asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, a guy my age, carrying a stuffed animal to the register…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You really are pathetic, you know that?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm-hmm."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was no denying it, but it still hurt Amane to hear it. He ought to be able to get<p></p>
        <p></p>
        over such a petty hang-up, but even walking into a store that carried stuffed animals<p></p>
        <p></p>
        by himself was enough to make him feel embarrassed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Fortunately, Chitose was with him today. Amane thought he might be able to convince<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her to accompany him to a shop on the way home. It certainly wasn't out of the question,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Chitose, come with me," said Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Whatcha mean?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Please accompany me to go shopping."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm, I wonder if I should…" It was just like Chitose to tease him like this.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Of course, she didn't really have any intention of refusing Amane's request, but there<p></p>
        <p></p>
        could be no doubt that she was putting on a deliberate act, both to make fun of Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and to force him to beg for her help.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm asking you, please. I'm really counting on you," Amane pleaded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mmm, I guess I could go… By the way, Amane, I feel like eating something sweet. And<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the crepe stand in front of the station has a super-delicious-looking limited-time<p></p>
        <p></p>
        item…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Please allow me to treat you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yay!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane grimaced at Chitose's clever manipulation, but he realized it was a small price<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to pay for her help. It was way better to pay for one crepe than to go into a cutesy shop<p></p>
        <p></p>
        all on his own. Amane let out a powerful sigh as he looked at Chitose, who was grinning<p></p>
        <p></p>
        impishly, then mentally calculated his approximate budget based on what was in his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wallet.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After consulting Itsuki and Chitose, Amane had at last made a decision on what to give<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru for her birthday. Staring at the back of the girl in question, a nervous<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expression overtook Amane's face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As compensation for a deluxe crepe from the shop in front of the station, the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Wintertime Limited Edition Berry Berry Special to be exact, Amane had asked Chitose<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for one more thing. It and the actual present were now sitting in a bag together. The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        problem was that Amane was completely at a loss for when he should give the gift to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The birthday girl was fixing dinner as usual, with no change in demeanor.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane didn't know what was on the menu, but it had the air of Japanese food and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        certainly didn't seem like anything special. She seemed relaxed as she went about her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        preparations.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had made no indication at all that today was anything but another regular day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She was acting so normal that Amane wondered if perhaps she even knew.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Mahiru started setting the table, Amane couldn't help but notice that her face<p></p>
        <p></p>
        remained completely unchanged. The two ate an extremely typical dinner and held a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        totally normal conversation. Through it all, Amane remained completely unsure of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        when best to present her with the gifts he'd gotten. Frowning, he glanced in the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        direction of the paper bag hidden behind his sofa.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He decided to wait until they had cleaned up after dinner and returned to the living<p></p>
        <p></p>
        room, when he could take a seat beside Mahiru on his two-person sofa. She'd brought<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some books to look over after their meal, so that seemed as good a time as any.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        True to her nickname, the angel was just as beautiful when she was reading.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Without knowing why, Amane hesitated a little to sit next to her, but even if he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hesitated, there was no way around it, so he grabbed the paper gift bag from its hiding<p></p>
        <p></p>
        place and sat down next to Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Immediately, the girl's head snapped up. Whether she'd noticed Amane's presence or<p></p>
        <p></p>
        heard the sound of the crinkling paper bag was unclear. Either way, her caramel-coloured eyes
        <p></p>
        turned toward Amane before shifting to what he was holding.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru looked confused, as if she still hadn't realized that this was about her birthday.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Here. For you." Amane placed the bag on Mahiru's knees, and the girl's expression<p></p>
        <p></p>
        grew even more puzzled.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What is this?" she asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's your birthday, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's true… but wait, how did you know that? I don't remember telling anyone."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was suddenly on guard.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Remember when you dropped your school ID in my apartment?" Amane reminded<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She seemed to understand, and her normal expression returned. "I really wish you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hadn't gone to the trouble. I… don't celebrate my birthday."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was certain that he'd heard a bit of cold detachment in Mahiru's voice when<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she spoke. The look in her eyes told him that even the word birthday was something<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she avoided.<p></p>
        <p></p>
