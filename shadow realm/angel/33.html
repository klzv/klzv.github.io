        <p></p>"…I don't even know how to respond to that. I'm not going
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>to force us to do things just because it's what couples are
        <p></p>supposed to do. Everything's like it always was."
        <p></p>"So that means you guys have always been fooling around,
        <p></p>right?"
        <p></p>"Listen here—"
        <p></p>"I think Yamazaki's got a point," Itsuki insisted. "You
        <p></p>might think you're being careful, but it's plain for everyone
        <p></p>to see. Even when I try to stop you two, you flirt. So I figured
        <p></p>if that's you guys trying to tone it down in public, you must
        <p></p>be even more flirtatious at home."
        <p></p>Amane didn't mean to do so, but he had ended up making
        <p></p>the case that he and Mahiru had always been intimate. He
        <p></p>started to insist it wasn't how it sounded but knew the other
        <p></p>boys probably wouldn't listen anyway, no matter what he
        <p></p>said.
        <p></p>"Wait, what do you mean 'at home'…?"
        <p></p>Amane cursed silently as the boys surrounding him
        <p></p>started to make a fuss. Too late, he realized Itsuki had added
        <p></p>some unnecessary information.
        <p></p>"Shiina is usually over at Amane's place, and I bet when
        <p></p>they're alone they flirt like crazy. They're already way past
        <p></p>dating; they're practically married, man."
        <p></p>"Itsuki…"
        <p></p>"If you try to hide it, people are gonna suspect something,
        <p></p>so I'll just go ahead and say it. Some people have already
        <p></p>spotted you going back to the same apartment building, so
        <p></p>really, I'm just setting the record straight before you end up
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>with a bad reputation."
        <p></p>Itsuki gave Amane a meaningful look, then pressed his
        <p></p>lips together tightly. They both knew Mahiru would be upset
        <p></p>if she became the subject of weird rumors.
        <p></p>It would definitely be bad if people thought Mahiru was
        <p></p>spending the night already, even though they had just
        <p></p>started going out. It wouldn't make Amane happy at all if
        <p></p>people said those kinds of things about her.
        <p></p>She had stayed over before, and he had lent her his bed,
        <p></p>but not once had they ever slept in the same room together.
        <p></p>Mahiru had pleaded with him to join her once when she was
        <p></p>half asleep, but he hadn't gone through with it, so surely that
        <p></p>didn't count.
        <p></p>"Now that I think about it, you did say that you were
        <p></p>neighbors with Shiina… Did you mean she's super close by?"
        <p></p>"…Well, we live in the same building, so she's at my place
        <p></p>a lot."
        <p></p>"So that means if we go over to your place, we could go to
        <p></p>hers, too…"
        <p></p>"I won't invite you up, so you'll get turned away at the
        <p></p>entrance. If you make any suspicious moves, the security
        <p></p>guard will come and throw you out. You can count on that."
        <p></p>Of course, the apartment building where Amane and
        <p></p>Mahiru lived wasn't fancy enough to have a concierge, but it
        <p></p>did have decent security. The building was designed for
        <p></p>fairly wealthy residents, with an inner courtyard, and
        <p></p>security guards who would deal with anyone acting
        <p></p>suspiciously.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Come on, that was a joke… So in other words, Shiina
        <p></p>hangs out at your place a lot, Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"H-hangs out? Well…yeah, we spend quite a lot of time
        <p></p>together, but—"
        <p></p>Mahiru wasn't just hanging out. Aside from bathing and
        <p></p>sleeping, she spent almost all her time at Amane's
        <p></p>apartment. She was practically living there. But Amane
        <p></p>knew if he said that, it would set the boys off again, so he
        <p></p>chose not to mention it.
        <p></p>But even with just that information, the other boys drew
        <p></p>closer to him, their eyes wide. From the sound of their chairs
        <p></p>scraping one after another across the floor, it was fairly
        <p></p>shocking news.
        <p></p>"Hold up, hold up, that's not right!"
        <p></p>"It's like something from a porno game plot. The old
        <p></p>'childhood friend' trope! It's not right!" 2
        <p></p>"And in the meantime, you two look like you have the
        <p></p>most wholesome relationship! If anything, we're losing our
        <p></p>minds because you're such a Goody Two-shoes. The only
        <p></p>thing we could do is to tell you to make a move."
        <p></p>"Wha…? Make a move? We only just started going out;
        <p></p>there's no way."
        <p></p>They had been dating for two weeks, and Amane was not
        <p></p>in a hurry to do anything like that. And even if he did want
        <p></p>to, he was worried that Mahiru would think he was only
        <p></p>interested in sex. 6
        <p></p>Amane had no intention of rushing things. He would leave
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>it to Mahiru, instead of pressing the issue and trying to force
        <p></p>things to move forward. Anyway, they hadn't even kissed
        <p></p>yet, so there was no way they were going to jump straight
        <p></p>into doing more.
        <p></p>"It's better to let time pass and take it slow," Amane said.
        <p></p>"We'll do stuff like that when we're both ready. I'm not going
        <p></p>to force it on her."
        <p></p>Amane felt embarrassed to be talking about the subject
        <p></p>and ended the conversation with an anticlimactic
        <p></p>pronouncement.
        <p></p>Itsuki looked around at the other boys and shrugged
        <p></p>dramatically. "You see? This is one of those things that
        <p></p>Shiina likes about Amane. He's a toootal gentleman. He's so
        <p></p>cautious and considerate, you could almost say he's
        <p></p>impotent." 2
        <p></p>"Fujimiya, are you out of your mind? Are you made of
        <p></p>flesh and blood? How can you even call yourself a man?"
        <p></p>"I see how it is. You're all here to make fun of me."
        <p></p>Amane scowled, wondering how anybody could see
        <p></p>anything other than a man when they looked at him.
        <p></p>From all sides, he heard things like, "If you had a girl as
        <p></p>cute as the angel by your side, why wouldn't you pin her
        <p></p>down?" and "This is what a loser looks like," which made his
        <p></p>mouth twitch.
        <p></p>"It's none of your business, so just shut up," Amane
        <p></p>insisted. "We're taking things at our own pace, so we don't
        <p></p>need anyone butting in."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"You know, I heard that Shiina has been getting advice
        <p></p>from Chi," Itsuki mentioned.
        <p></p>"Well, you can tell Chitose to be careful about what she
        <p></p>says. Mahiru doesn't need to learn everything that Chitose
        <p></p>has to teach."
        <p></p>Even though Mahiru had a good head on her shoulders,
        <p></p>she was a beginner when it came to adult relationships, and
        <p></p>Amane was worried that Chitose might give her false
        <p></p>expectations.
        <p></p>"So you're insisting that you should be the one to instruct
        <p></p>the innocent Shiina?"
        <p></p>"Cut it out, man."
        <p></p>Amane glared critically at Itsuki, wondering why he had
        <p></p>to interpret everything that way, but Itsuki feigned
        <p></p>innocence.
        <p></p>"Now, now. Besides, even if I told Chi to stop, the other
        <p></p>girls are probably telling her all sorts of things, too. Shiina's
        <p></p>in love, she's adorable, and they're gonna give her advice."
        <p></p>"And what good does that do me, if they give her all kinds
        <p></p>of weird ideas?"
        <p></p>"You get to appreciate Shiina's charming, adorable efforts,
        <p></p>of course."
        <p></p>"Well, I guess I can't argue with that, but just try putting
        <p></p>yourself in my shoes; think of the shock my poor heart will
        <p></p>have to take."
        <p></p>"Isn't it nice that she's working so hard for you?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>When Itsuki put it that way, Amane couldn't possibly
        <p></p>refute it, so he just frowned and kept his complaints to
        <p></p>himself. Itsuki must have known how he would react
        <p></p>because he cackled with laughter.
        <p></p>"Well, I can't stop Chi from trying to help, since she's
        <p></p>decided she wants to encourage Mahiru's love for you."
        <p></p>"…It's your fault for not knowing what kind of advice your
        <p></p>girlfriend might be giving."
        <p></p>"I don't think she's telling her anything too extreme. Even
        <p></p>Chi has some tact, after all."
        <p></p>"I wonder…"
        <p></p>"Just the other day, I saw Shirakawa lecturing Shiina on
        <p></p>how to cuddle, telling her, 'Amane will be happy if you do
        <p></p>things like this,'" another boy added.
        <p></p>"Itsuki, you have a duty to control her…"
        <p></p>"Like it's my fault?!"
        <p></p>Amane looked accusingly at Itsuki and said, "So she is
        <p></p>teaching Mahiru all kinds of weird stuff?"
        <p></p>It was easy to imagine Chitose had, for better or worse,
        <p></p>been filling Mahiru's head with all sorts of information
        <p></p>about male-female relationships. The only one who could
        <p></p>keep Chitose in check was Itsuki, so Amane thought that
        <p></p>Itsuki ought to be the one to stop her.
        <p></p>Amane let out an exasperated sigh, and the boys
        <p></p>surrounding him stared at him in silence. The atmosphere
        <p></p>was indescribable.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"So this is just you boasting about your love life?" one of
        <p></p>the boys asked, summarizing what everyone wanted to say.
        <p></p>"…That wasn't my intention," Amane replied. But there
        <p></p>wasn't a single boy there who believed him.
        <p></p>"That reminds me, you guys were all riled up during gym
        <p></p>today; did something interesting happen?"
        <p></p>Classes were over for the day, and they had returned
        <p></p>home. Amane hadn't been prepared for Mahiru's sudden
        <p></p>question, and he dropped his smartphone, letting it fall to
        <p></p>his lap. It was quite heavy because of the wallet-style case, so
        <p></p>he felt a bit of pain in his thighs as he returned Mahiru's
        <p></p>gaze, and their eyes met. She was sitting beside Amane with
        <p></p>a very puzzled look.
        <p></p>She obviously knew the boys had been talking about
        <p></p>something. They had kept chatting after the period ended, so
        <p></p>she must have heard voices when she came back to the
        <p></p>classroom.
        <p></p>"Oh, well no, um, please don't worry about it."
        <p></p>Amane averted his eyes. He couldn't possibly tell her that
        <p></p>they had been asking how far he and Mahiru had gone.
        <p></p>"Huh…?" Mahiru sounded upset. "Usually when you say
        <p></p>something like that, it's exactly the sort of situation I should
        <p></p>be worried about it."
        <p></p>"It was just regular boy talk; we had some catching up to
        <p></p>do, you could say."
        <p></p>"Uh-huh… The type of conversation that you can't repeat
        <p></p>—or don't want to?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"It's not that I can't repeat it, it's just embarrassing."
        <p></p>His reply seemed likely to invite misunderstanding, but
        <p></p>Amane was ashamed to explain their conversation in detail,
        <p></p>so he settled on being vague. Mahiru stayed quiet as she
        <p></p>stared at Amane.
        <p></p>Is she fed up with me or displeased…? He felt a slight
        <p></p>twinge of pain somewhere near his stomach, but Mahiru
        <p></p>gave an uneasy smile.
        <p></p>"Ah, if you don't really want to say, that's fine; you don't
        <p></p>have to. It wouldn't be nice for me to pry; you deserve your
        <p></p>own privacy, too. I'm sure there are some things that boys
        <p></p>only talk about with other boys. Some topics that girls ought
        <p></p>not ask you about."
        <p></p>"I have mixed feelings about how understanding you are,
        <p></p>but… Well, it's nothing that serious. Would it be okay to not
        <p></p>talk about it?"
        <p></p>"I mean, you would never ask me what I talk about with
        <p></p>other girls, right?"
        <p></p>"I guess not. If I went about it poorly, I would probably
        <p></p>offend you, though I wouldn't ask anything you didn't want
        <p></p>to answer. Even if you're my girlfriend, that doesn't mean
        <p></p>it's okay to tell you how to lead your life, you know?"
        <p></p>Amane was smart enough to know that girls had all sorts
        <p></p>of secret conversations among themselves. Even though he
        <p></p>was curious about what Mahiru might have discussed, he
        <p></p>was also afraid of the answer, so he didn't really want to ask.
        <p></p>Still, he figured there were probably people who would have
        <p></p>liked to pry.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru was her own person with her own life, so Amane
        <p></p>intended to respect her privacy, even if she was his
        <p></p>girlfriend.
        <p></p>That's the difference between them and me.
        <p></p>This time, Amane looked directly at Mahiru, and she
        <p></p>smiled softly, looking amused.
        <p></p>"I feel the same way," she said. "I don't think it's right for
        <p></p>me to try to know everything about you just because I like
        <p></p>you. Even if there are things I don't know, that doesn't
        <p></p>change how I feel about you, Amane."
        <p></p>"…That's one of the charming things about you, you
        <p></p>know."
        <p></p>"Right back at you."
        <p></p>Mahiru giggled in her elegant voice and leaned against his
        <p></p>arm. Amane felt self-conscious because he could sense her
        <p></p>trust in him. Tracing the pad of his finger lightly over the
        <p></p>smooth back of her hand, he whispered, "Is it really all right
        <p></p>if I don't tell you?"
        <p></p>His conversation with the other boys wasn't something he
        <p></p>particularly wanted to share, but neither was it something he
        <p></p>felt like he had to hide. He was prepared to tell her if not
        <p></p>knowing made her anxious, but Mahiru smiled, still leaning
        <p></p>against him.
        <p></p>"If you want to tell me, I'll listen, but if it's something
        <p></p>you'd rather not share, then I won't ask."
        <p></p>She left it up to him to do as he pleased, and Amane
        <p></p>pondered over what to do for a full ten seconds before slowly
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>opening his mouth to speak.
        <p></p>"…Well, um, how do I put it? The guys were asking me
        <p></p>how things have changed since we started going out, and
        <p></p>they asked me how far we've gone, and other typical
        <p></p>questions like that."
        <p></p>The other boys probably already had their suspicions, but
        <p></p>they hadn't said them out loud, so Amane hadn't responded
        <p></p>to them. But they had also expressed interest in how things
        <p></p>had changed for him, so he had decided to make that the
        <p></p>main point when telling Mahiru.
        <p></p>Amane spoke hesitantly, but Mahiru seemed to
        <p></p>understand. "I guess they were curious about it, huh?" She
        <p></p>smiled wryly. "But things that have changed since we started
        <p></p>dating… I guess my awareness of you has. Like, I touch you a
        <p></p>lot on purpose now, but that's it."
        <p></p>"That's because we were already close to begin with.
        <p></p>Rather than saying we've changed, I feel like our
        <p></p>surroundings have instead."
        <p></p>The two of them had only realized it upon later reflection,
        <p></p>but they had been touching each other in moderation before
        <p></p>they even started dating. They held hands when Amane was
        <p></p>escorting her to places, embraced when consoling each
        <p></p>other, and once, Mahiru had kissed his cheek for revenge.
        <p></p>They'd been so touchy that it was strange they hadn't
        <p></p>become a couple sooner.
        <p></p>It was extremely embarrassing to think about, and Amane
        <p></p>wondered why he hadn't been able to return her affection at
        <p></p>the time. He had been cautious—no, cowardly—so he
        <p></p>couldn't work up the determination.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Of course, he was ashamed of how pathetic he'd been, so
        <p></p>moving forward, he wanted to be able to take the lead with
        <p></p>Mahiru, and he intended to put in the effort so he would be
        <p></p>able to do so confidently.
        <p></p>"You're right about that. And you've totally fixed your
        <p></p>appearance, which changed how people see you. It's gotten
        <p></p>easier for everyone, even girls, to talk to you."
        <p></p>"No, the only time girls speak to me is to cheer me on,
        <p></p>so…"
        <p></p>"But I've been hearing people say you look cool, too, you
        <p></p>know? And that your smile is cute."
        <p></p>"That smile was probably directed at you, though… You're
        <p></p>the only one I see," Amane whispered quietly to calm her. 2
        <p></p>He couldn't help imagining that she was feeling a little
        <p></p>jealous.
        <p></p>Even as her cheeks flushed slightly, she pressed her head
        <p></p>against him and didn't seem at all dissatisfied.
        <p></p>Amane thought about how cherubic and cute she looked
        <p></p>when she did that, but he knew that if he said it out loud, she
        <p></p>would scold him to not treat her like a child, so he kept it to
        <p></p>himself and smiled quietly.
        <p></p>As Amane gazed lovingly at Mahiru, who seemed to be in
        <p></p>a good mood, he recalled what had happened when he was
        <p></p>surrounded by his classmates and remembered there was
        <p></p>something he needed to ask her.
        <p></p>"Anyway, I did hear one thing that I want to ask about."
        <p></p>"Oh?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Mahiru, it seems you've been getting advice from Chitose
        <p></p>and some of the other girls. They're not telling you anything
        <p></p>weird, right?"
        <p></p>He stared at Mahiru with the unspoken additional
        <p></p>question of And you're not telling them any details about
        <p></p>our relationship, right? Mahiru looked up awkwardly at
        <p></p>Amane and then suddenly averted her gaze.
        <p></p>"…Only a little bit—"
        <p></p>"They are, aren't they? Well… I won't tell you not to talk to
        <p></p>them, but please try not to expose too much of our personal
        <p></p>lives. It'll be super embarrassing if rumors start circulating."
        <p></p>"I-I'll be careful."
        <p></p>Consulting with her friends wasn't an issue, but Amane
        <p></p>didn't want Mahiru to share too much about their
        <p></p>relationship. Of course, he trusted Mahiru to exercise good
        <p></p>judgment, but she could also be a little careless sometimes,
        <p></p>so Amane figured it would be best to warn her, just in case.
        <p></p>Mahiru shrank back into her seat, perhaps thinking that
        <p></p>she had already overshared, even if they were her friends.
        <p></p>Not that Amane hadn't also consulted with Itsuki and
        <p></p>Yuuta, but he had always chosen his topics carefully and had
        <p></p>never asked them anything particularly deep. He was
        <p></p>starting to suspect that maybe Mahiru had some major
        <p></p>complaint or insecurity about their relationship.
        <p></p>"…Are you really that anxious about dating me?" he asked.
        <p></p>"A-anxious? It's not like that… Um, I j-just asked them
        <p></p>how I could make you happy." 3
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"But I'm perfectly happy just being with you…"
        <p></p>"Yes, of course… You're the type who says it's more than
        <p></p>enough just to be with me. You don't desire much, and you
        <p></p>rarely make requests of people, isn't that right?"
        <p></p>"I feel like I could say the same about you."
        <p></p>All of what she'd said also applied to Mahiru herself, but
        <p></p>after blinking several times, hiding her caramel-colored eyes
        <p></p>for a moment each time they closed, she smiled at him
        <p></p>coquettishly.
        <p></p>"…I can be quite greedy, you know? I want to have you all
        <p></p>to myself; I want to pamper you and be pampered."
        <p></p>"Right back at you, as you would say."
        <p></p>"You want to be spoiled?"
        <p></p>"…W-well, I like you, so yes, and I want to do the same for
        <p></p>you, too. As for keeping you all to myself, well, I'll try to only
        <p></p>do that when we're at home."
        <p></p>Mahiru probably didn't think so, but Amane had always
        <p></p>considered himself to be the more possessive one.
        <p></p>He knew, of course, that Mahiru had her own feelings and
        <p></p>her own life—and that she should be able to live however she
        <p></p>wanted. Amane did want to respect that, but…be that as it
        <p></p>may, she was his girlfriend, and he often caught himself
        <p></p>wishing he didn't have to share her with anyone else.
        <p></p>He knew Mahiru was popular, and he could accept that
        <p></p>for what it was, but he still wanted to pull his cute girlfriend
        <p></p>into his arms and keep her for himself. He wished she would
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>show her sweet side only to him and that she wouldn't be
        <p></p>affectionate with anybody else. That was how deeply Amane
        <p></p>loved Mahiru.
        <p></p>Man, that's heavy, even for me…, he chided himself. But
        <p></p>for some reason, Mahiru smiled pleasantly, looking tickled.
        <p></p>"…I found one thing that has changed about you since we
        <p></p>started dating, Amane."
        <p></p>"What?"
        <p></p>"You're more honest about expressing your emotions now
        <p></p>—and showing love."
        <p></p>Far from balking at Amane's heavy feelings, Mahiru
        <p></p>looked up at him bashfully and leaned in close, happy to
        <p></p>accept him.
        <p></p>Amane also thought that he had become more honest,
        <p></p>compared to before they were dating. He had pined after
        <p></p>Mahiru for so long, and he wanted to treasure her and never
        <p></p>upset her with his words. Thus he'd naturally become
        <p></p>gentler, as he tried his best to express his love so that
        <p></p>Mahiru would never feel disheartened.
        <p></p>"Well, I figure that nice words aren't enough. If I don't
        <p></p>show you properly how much I love you, you'll sour on me, I
        <p></p>hear."
        <p></p>"That's just like you, Amane."
        <p></p>"Is it something you're unhappy with?"
        <p></p>"No, it's a good point, of course, but just… Sometimes it's
        <p></p>bad for my heart, you could say."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane felt a surge of love for Mahiru, who had her cheeks
        <p></p>puffed out slightly as if he was being unfair, and he patted
        <p></p>her head.
        <p></p>"I don't want to hear that from you; you're just as bad."
        <p></p>"And what would you say I've done?"
        <p></p>"Everything about you is adorable, and you leave yourself
        <p></p>so defenseless. It's tough to bear."
        <p></p>"…You really are bad for my heart," Mahiru said, slapping
        <p></p>Amane's arm playfully.
        <p></p>Naturally, he couldn't do the same thing back to her, so he
        <p></p>tapped the pad of his finger against her cheek in a tickling
        <p></p>way as revenge.

        <p></p>"Amane, I've got someplace to go today, so is it all right if
        <p></p>we head home separately?" Mahiru asked. It was early July,
        <p></p>and they'd just been about to leave school together, as
        <p></p>always.
        <p></p>It was an unexpected request coming from Mahiru, who
        <p></p>always wanted to walk home with Amane, and he caught
        <p></p>himself staring at her without meaning to.
        <p></p>As a rule, Amane accompanied her whenever she had to
        <p></p>make a side trip, so the fact that she was gently stopping him
        <p></p>from doing so meant it was probably something she didn't
        <p></p>want him to know about.
        <p></p>But he could tell from Mahiru's expression that it wasn't
        <p></p>anything she felt particularly guilty over, so he wasn't
        <p></p>worried about it.
        <p></p>The sun set later in the summer, so it should be fine as
        <p></p>long as her errand didn't take a long time. Though if he was
        <p></p>to state his true feelings, he would have liked to go home
        <p></p>together.
        <p></p>"Mm, got it. I'll see you later, then."
        <p></p>He knew that either way he was going to have plenty of
        <p></p>time to spend with her at home, so he respected Mahiru's
        <p></p>wishes.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>She looked relieved by his answer but then opened her
        <p></p>eyes a little bit wider, as if she had suddenly realized
        <p></p>something, and gave him a look like she was raising her
        <p></p>guard just a little.
        <p></p>"…Don't walk home with any other girls, okay?"
        <p></p>"Do you think I would do that?"
        <p></p>"You wouldn't, but there's a possibility that you'll be
        <p></p>asked, you see. That's… Well, I'm not saying they can't, but I
        <p></p>don't like it. Other girls have been talking to you lately,
        <p></p>and…"
        <p></p>It was a miracle Amane didn't react out loud.
        <p></p>…Don't tell me…she's jealous?
        <p></p>It should have been obvious from the way he acted toward
        <p></p>Mahiru that Amane hadn't been asked by other girls, but
        <p></p>apparently, Mahiru had started worrying about it.
        <p></p>Actually, the only girls who had spoken to him had done
        <p></p>so to show their support for his relationship and wish him
        <p></p>good luck, so there was no need for concern.
        <p></p>Even though he still felt slightly uncomfortable, Mahiru
        <p></p>was looking up at him with an imploring, anxious
        <p></p>expression. He wanted to stroke her hair because of how
        <p></p>cute she was, but there were eyes all around them, so he
        <p></p>restrained himself.
        <p></p>He had messed up once before and everyone had huddled
        <p></p>around to see Mahiru's smiling face, so naturally he wasn't
        <p></p>about to repeat that mistake.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"It's all right. I only have eyes for you, and I haven't told
        <p></p>anyone I'll walk home with them. Unless you count being
        <p></p>dragged around by Chitose."
        <p></p>"…That's good to hear."
        <p></p>If it was Chitose, it seemed like it would be okay. But to
        <p></p>begin with, she had Itsuki, so she was definitely not
        <p></p>interested in Amane. And he had also never looked at
        <p></p>Chitose that way, so Mahiru probably felt at ease.
        <p></p>Mahiru relaxed her shoulders, seemingly relieved by
        <p></p>Amane's words, and this time, she gazed up at him with a
        <p></p>hint of embarrassment.
        <p></p>"Also, um, just because I don't want there to be any
        <p></p>chance of a misunderstanding, I'll tell you where we're
        <p></p>going."
        <p></p>"You don't need to keep it a secret?"
        <p></p>"N-no."
        <p></p>He got the sense that she was fairly hesitant to say it, but
        <p></p>he waited patiently for her to continue.
        <p></p>"W-well…we're…going shopping."
        <p></p>"Gotcha. That doesn't really seem like anything to be
        <p></p>embarrassed about."
        <p></p>"I'm going with Chitose…u-um—to buy a swimsuit, so—" 1
        <p></p>"…A swimsuit?"
        <p></p>Sure enough, it was July, and they were being sold in all
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>the stores now.
        <p></p>In the shopping mall that they frequently visited, a special
        <p></p>shop had opened just for selling swimsuits, and Amane had
        <p></p>fresh memories of girls from their class talking about going
        <p></p>to buy some.
        <p></p>But he had never thought Mahiru would.
        <p></p>After all, Mahiru couldn't swim.
        <p></p>That was what she'd said, and she had even chosen a
        <p></p>school where swimming wasn't a compulsory subject, so it
        <p></p>had to be true.
        <p></p>But Mahiru wanted a bathing suit.
        <p></p>"…Weren't we going to go to the pool together…?" she
        <p></p>whispered as she drew her body near shyly.
        <p></p>In response to her words, Amane stiffened, then he
        <p></p>covered his face with his hand.
        <p></p>…I wish you wouldn't make that kind of face when you
        <p></p>say it…
        <p></p>Sure enough, the other students in the classroom were
        <p></p>looking their way.
        <p></p>From looks of confusion to tepid smiles, a variety of
        <p></p>expressions were directed at them, and Amane felt unsettled
        <p></p>by a mixture of discomfort and embarrassment. Even under
        <p></p>normal circumstances, he had trouble keeping it together
        <p></p>when he saw Mahiru looking bashful, and in this
        <p></p>atmosphere, with people watching, he could hardly stand
        <p></p>being there.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…I see. Um… Enjoy your shopping."
        <p></p>"Th-thanks… What kind should I get?"
        <p></p>"Nothing too suggestive," he answered immediately. 3
        <p></p>Anything that fit Mahiru's style, even a swimsuit, was sure
        <p></p>to be suitable, but Amane would have preferred that it didn't
        <p></p>expose any more than necessary.
        <p></p>After all, it had only been several weeks since they had
        <p></p>started dating, and for the most part, he hadn't seen much of
        <p></p>her bare skin.
        <p></p>At school, she buttoned her shirts all the way up and
        <p></p>always wore tights. She dressed so modestly that he
        <p></p>sometimes worried she might overheat.
        <p></p>At home, she never wore clothes that exposed her chest,
        <p></p>and she wore a lot of long skirts. Whenever she wore shorts,
        <p></p>she also had on tights underneath.
        <p></p>In other words, Amane had never seen much of Mahiru's
        <p></p>body. He'd never even had the chance to.
        <p></p>Under those circumstances, if she chose a sexy swimsuit, 3
        <p></p>Amane would probably wind up curled into a ball on the
        <p></p>floor for a while.
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes went wide, and she blinked in surprise at
        <p></p>Amane's definitive answer, then she snorted quietly.
        <p></p>"That's a very Amane answer."
        <p></p>"I would die. So pick one that's not too flashy."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, what to do…?"
        <p></p>"Mahiru—"
        <p></p>"I'll consult with Chitose about what will make you
        <p></p>happy." 1
        <p></p>Mahiru still looked a little shy, and Amane pressed his lips
        <p></p>together tightly.
        <p></p>I'd better send Chitose a message telling her not to
        <p></p>recommend anything weird.
        <p></p>It was a matter of life or death. He had to stop her, to save 2
        <p></p>himself. 1
        <p></p>Amane made up his mind to send a message to Chitose,
        <p></p>who was currently not in the classroom, and poked Mahiru
        <p></p>in the cheek. She looked like she was thinking of something
        <p></p>mischievous.
        <p></p>At the end of the day, Mahiru refused to tell him what
        <p></p>kind of swimsuit she had purchased. She dodged the
        <p></p>question with an impish answer, saying "You can look
        <p></p>forward to when I put it on."
        <p></p>He had gone ahead and warned Chitose, but it was
        <p></p>doubtful whether she had listened. If anything, from the way
        <p></p>she had gleefully told Mahiru that she thought her choice
        <p></p>would make him happy, he was sure she had recommended
        <p></p>something that showed a lot of skin.
        <p></p>"I'm begging you, not something too flashy," Amane's
        <p></p>grumbling echoed in the otherwise empty bathroom.
        <p></p>He had gotten into the bathtub to wash his sweat off,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>leaving the post-meal cleanup to Mahiru after she
        <p></p>volunteered to do it, but he couldn't help worrying about the
        <p></p>swimsuit.
        <p></p>Amane was a high school boy, so of course he had
        <p></p>fantasized about what kind of swimsuit his girlfriend might
        <p></p>wear.
        <p></p>Something that generously exposed her slender body
        <p></p>would certainly be attractive. Mahiru had always had a curvy
        <p></p>figure, so if she wore a bikini or something, he was certain
        <p></p>he wouldn't be able to gaze directly at her. 1
        <p></p>His heart was pounding just imagining it, and his body
        <p></p>was burning up. Part of that was because he was soaking in
        <p></p>the tub, but he was hot for another reason, too. 2
        <p></p>…I'm sure anything would look good on her, but I would
        <p></p>have a hard time looking at her or even standing next to 2
        <p></p>her.
        <p></p>Amane thought he had a right to see—and a right to stand
        <p></p>by her side. But next to her, he would be practically invisible.
        <p></p>He glanced quickly down at his own body, but it was still a
        <p></p>far cry from perfect. He had never had much meat on his
        <p></p>bones to begin with, so he was already starting to see the 1
        <p></p>bumps of his abdominal muscles, but he had yet to reach his
        <p></p>ideal body type. Most people would have considered him
        <p></p>kind of scrawny.
        <p></p>No matter how he thought about it, he didn't feel like a
        <p></p>particularly strong or stylish kind of guy.
        <p></p>He wished his physique was a little more solidly built, but
        <p></p>he had always assumed that since both of his parents were
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>slim, his body type was probably hereditary, so there was 1
        <p></p>nothing he could do. To make up for it, he was tall, so he felt
        <p></p>very grateful to his parents for that at least.
        <p></p>"…I should consult with Kadowaki and increase my
        <p></p>strength training a little more."
        <p></p>He had already established a good foundation, and
        <p></p>recently, he'd been lifting even heavier weights. If he worked
        <p></p>a little harder, while being sure not to overdo it, then he'd
        <p></p>definitely be able to improve his physique before debuting
        <p></p>his bathing suit body.
        <p></p>He was determined to stand by Mahiru's side, so he
        <p></p>couldn't slack off and would need to try even harder so he
        <p></p>could have confidence in himself.
        <p></p>Amane sighed softly and dipped his face halfway into the
        <p></p>bathwater.
        <p></p>He had worked himself up imagining Mahiru in her
        <p></p>swimsuit and himself next to her. Now he was too hot.
        <p></p>Normally, when he soaked in the bathtub, he would be in
        <p></p>there for about ten minutes, so his anguish was obvious
        <p></p>when it took him over half an hour before he got out.
        <p></p>Since he had spent more than three times the usual
        <p></p>amount in the bath, it was about ten thirty. He confirmed
        <p></p>the time by checking the waterproof clock that he kept in the
        <p></p>bathroom. Mahiru typically went back to her own apartment
        <p></p>at ten o'clock, so she should have already left.
        <p></p>With that presumption, Amane wiped away the water
        <p></p>dripping off his body and immediately got dressed. He was
        <p></p>very warm from having soaked for too long, so he decided to
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>let the air conditioner cool him off and didn't put on a shirt.
        <p></p>Wearing only a pair of sweatpants, with a towel over his
        <p></p>head, Amane imagined his parents scolding him for looking
        <p></p>so sloppy as he left the bathroom and returned to the living
        <p></p>room.
        <p></p>Wondering if there were any good shows on television,
        <p></p>Amane walked in with his eyes on the screen. But as soon as
        <p></p>he got there, he saw a familiar curtain of flaxen hair hanging
        <p></p>down the back of the sofa.
        <p></p>She hasn't gone home yet?
        <p></p>Normally Mahiru wouldn't have been there, but oddly
        <p></p>enough, she had stayed.
        <p></p>She was looking down a little bit, moving her arm while
        <p></p>staring at something in her hands. She was probably tending
        <p></p>to some schoolwork that she would usually have done at
        <p></p>home. Amane approached her with interest, marveling that
        <p></p>she was, as ever, the hard worker.
        <p></p>"It's unusual for you to be here so late."
        <p></p>Mahiru must have been concentrating, because when
        <p></p>Amane spoke to her as he picked up the remote control from
        <p></p>the coffee table and changed the channel, she finally noticed
        <p></p>his presence, lifted her face, and froze.
        <p></p>"Yes, uh, ah…"
        <p></p>"What is it?"
        <p></p>"Uh, why—why aren't you wearing anything on top…?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>It was how he typically looked after getting out of the bath
        <p></p>during the summer, so nothing seemed particularly off to
        <p></p>Amane, but Mahiru was clearly flustered and covered her
        <p></p>face with her hands.
        <p></p>He could see her skin flushed red in between her fingers.
        <p></p>"What do you mean, why? I'm hot."
        <p></p>"P-please don't come out like that while I'm here."
        <p></p>"I mean, I figured you had gone home… It's already ten
        <p></p>thirty."
        <p></p>"I wanted to say goodnight before I left."
        <p></p>So that's why she's still here.
        <p></p>Amane sat down beside Mahiru. As he did, her shoulders
        <p></p>flinched in surprise, which made him laugh.
        <p></p>"…Are you really that embarrassed?"
        <p></p>"Of course I'm embarrassed!"
        <p></p>"But if you bought a swimsuit, you must have been
        <p></p>planning to see me in mine, too, right? But I can't be in the
        <p></p>living room like this?"
        <p></p>"Uh…"
        <p></p>Mahiru had said she was going to buy a bathing suit
        <p></p>because she planned to go swimming with him.
        <p></p>In that case, surely the thought had crossed her mind that
        <p></p>Amane would be in his, too. It was only natural if they were
        <p></p>going together.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>In other words, she must have assumed she would see
        <p></p>him half naked.
        <p></p>Yet she was getting so flustered at the sight of his bare
        <p></p>torso. It made him wonder whether they would actually be
        <p></p>able to go to the pool. If looking at his body shook her up
        <p></p>this much, he wondered how she would react to seeing other
        <p></p>boys in their swimsuits.
        <p></p>It wasn't the first time—she was embarrassed to see his
        <p></p>chest before they were together and seemed opposed to
        <p></p>seeing boys' skin at all. He was unsure whether they would
        <p></p>be able to go to the pool or the ocean.
        <p></p>"…It's nice that you bought a swimsuit, but I think it's
        <p></p>possible that you might not be able to go to the pool."
        <p></p>"Th-that's probably true, but—"
        <p></p>"In that case, how about getting used to it now, ahead of
        <p></p>time?"
        <p></p>At the moment, he was less exposed than he would be in
        <p></p>his swimsuit, so it was a chance for her to grow accustomed
        <p></p>to seeing him like this, but Mahiru shook her head
        <p></p>vigorously.
        <p></p>"I—I can't. I can't look at you as you are now."
        <p></p>"Why not?"
        <p></p>"…B-because you're…like, really sexy." 2
        <p></p>"Sexy?"
        <p></p>"You just got out of the bath; I really can't."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Apparently, the reason why she hadn't made eye contact
        <p></p>with him since he entered the room wasn't just because she
        <p></p>could see his skin. Despite what she'd said, Amane didn't
        <p></p>believe he was particularly attractive, but it was obvious that
        <p></p>Mahiru thought differently.
        <p></p>Amane did think that Mahiru was even more alluring
        <p></p>when she'd just gotten out of the bath, and he figured that
        <p></p>anyone probably found the person they liked even more
        <p></p>appealing in such a state.
        <p></p>As the one who was usually getting flustered by Mahiru,
        <p></p>seeing her react to him like that made Amane feel kind of
        <p></p>good, in a sadistic sort of way, but he knew that if he teased
        <p></p>her too much, Mahiru would probably get upset.
        <p></p>"If you hate it that much, I'll go put on clothes, okay?"
        <p></p>"I—I don't hate it or anything, but…w-wait a second, I'll
        <p></p>do my best."
        <p></p>"No, if it's really an issue, I'll get dressed."
        <p></p>"I-if I don't get used to it, I'll be in more trouble! Since I'm
        <p></p>going with you to the p-p-pool."
        <p></p>Mahiru spoke very bravely and glanced over at him, her
        <p></p>face red and her gaze wandering unsteadily over to other
        <p></p>spots around the room. Amane watched her struggle without
        <p></p>rushing her.
        <p></p>He couldn't exactly complain, since if he were in Mahiru's
        <p></p>position, he would definitely be letting his eyes wander,
        <p></p>probably even more than she was. It likely wouldn't just be
        <p></p>his gaze, either—his whole body would probably try to make
        <p></p>a run for it.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…I know you've been putting in a lot of work, Amane,
        <p></p>and as someone who's been rooting for you, I'm happy to see
        <p></p>that you're getting results."
        <p></p>"Mm-hmm."
        <p></p>"B-but…u-um…recently you look too good; I can't take it.
        <p></p>Ever since you found your confidence, you're too goodlooking, and it's not fair!" 2
        <p></p>"Not fair…?"
        <p></p>"I'm the one whose heart is pounding all the time!"
        <p></p>"…I can't just let that one go."
        <p></p>Amane knew that Mahiru's heart beat fast for him, but
        <p></p>she couldn't possibly think that his heart wasn't pounding,
        <p></p>too. Just like her, his heart was thumping harder than usual.
        <p></p>On top of that, Amane was sitting by Mahiru's side
        <p></p>burdened with other troubles that she probably didn't have.
        <p></p>From his perspective, she was the one who wasn't playing
        <p></p>fair.
        <p></p>He decided to make her realize a little bit of what he was
        <p></p>feeling, so he extended a hand out toward Mahiru's back and
        <p></p>pulled her dainty body toward him.
        <p></p>She must have been unprepared because she wasn't
        <p></p>looking at him, and she easily fell into Amane's arms, her
        <p></p>cheek coming to rest against his bare chest.
        <p></p>Her small frame was trembling noticeably.
        <p></p>"Aaamane—"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…You can yell at me for sexual harassment, or you can 1
        <p></p>run away if you like, but I want you to understand just a 1
        <p></p>little of what I'm feeling."
        <p></p>Embracing a girl while half naked was something that
        <p></p>Amane would normally never do. He hadn't intentionally
        <p></p>undressed in front of Mahiru after all, but in the moment,
        <p></p>there was no helping it.
        <p></p>"My heart is beating out of my chest… As a guy, I've got a
        <p></p>lot more to worry about in this kind of situation." 1
        <p></p>Of course, Amane was the reason why they were in this
        <p></p>situation, so he wasn't trying to put any of the blame on
        <p></p>Mahiru. But being alone together with his girlfriend at night,
        <p></p>he felt like he couldn't settle down no matter what. It was
        <p></p>absurd to think that Mahiru was the only one whose heart
        <p></p>was pounding.
        <p></p>In his arms, Mahiru had her cheek against Amane's chest
        <p></p>and seemed to be listening to his heartbeat, blinking
        <p></p>repeatedly in surprise with a bright-red face.
        <p></p>He seemed to have gotten his point across, so he took his
        <p></p>hands off of Mahiru, but she kept leaning against him and
        <p></p>didn't try to move.
        <p></p>"…I'm sorry; that was rude."
        <p></p>"N-not really… U-um…Amane, when you do stuff like
        <p></p>that, it's really…i-it's so manly."
        <p></p>"As opposed to…?"
        <p></p>Amane furrowed his eyebrow as he wondered whether he
        <p></p>had just been insulted, but when he saw the panic in
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes and felt her trembling, he loosened up his
        <p></p>expression.
        <p></p>"I-it's not that I didn't think you were a man. It's just,
        <p></p>um…when I'm pressed directly up against you like this…it
        <p></p>really makes me aware of it."
        <p></p>She answered him honestly, even though it seemed like it
        <p></p>was a little bit difficult for her to say. Though hesitant, she
        <p></p>touched Amane's chest with her hand. Slowly, she caressed
        <p></p>him like a fragile object, and at first, Amane felt ticklish until
        <p></p>the embarrassment set in.
        <p></p>"…Amane, you're so slim…"
        <p></p>"Sorry for being skinny. I must seem weak."
        <p></p>"That's not true at all. Just—y-you're more solid than I
        <p></p>thought. You're sturdy; I was surprised…" 1
        <p></p>With the tip of her finger, she slowly traced over the
        <p></p>center of his torso.
        <p></p>He wasn't really building much muscle, but the results of
        <p></p>his training were apparent, and his midsection had firmed
        <p></p>up somewhat. Mahiru gently traced her finger over his
        <p></p>abdominal muscles like they might break, though they
        <p></p>wouldn't, checking the feel of them.
        <p></p>Even though he was doing this for her, so she could get
        <p></p>used to his bare skin, he was struck with a jumble of extreme
        <p></p>uneasiness, frustration, and shame—and he found himself
        <p></p>struggling desperately to restrain a groan.
        <p></p>"I've…never touched a guy's body before, so this is new to
        <p></p>me—and surprising…"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…You're allowed to at any time you like, but if you touch
        <p></p>me too much, you'll have to deal with the consequences."
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes were perfectly clear as she blinked up at
        <p></p>Amane, though he could see a hint of shyness. Amane's
        <p></p>heart ached with a subtle suspicion that he might be the only
        <p></p>one feeling guilty about this.
        <p></p>However, the way she was stroking his skin, tracing over
        <p></p>it with her finger as if to get the feel of it, was driving him
        <p></p>nuts, so naturally he wanted to stop her. But he didn't want
        <p></p>to make her uncomfortable.
        <p></p>"I'm going to have to touch all the same spots that you
        <p></p>are."
        <p></p>Teasingly, he gently ran his hand across Mahiru's waist,
        <p></p>and she let out a feeble shriek and jumped in surprise.
        <p></p>Mahiru had always been ticklish and would start trembling
        <p></p>at the slightest touch, so he had touched her very lightly, but
        <p></p>she had reacted super sensitively.
        <p></p>He had only brushed his hand against her once and then
        <p></p>stopped, intending to withdraw and apologize immediately if
        <p></p>she seemed upset. But rather than displeasure, Mahiru
        <p></p>lowered her eyes in seeming embarrassment and pressed her
        <p></p>forehead against Amane's chest.
        <p></p>"I—I like it when you touch me, Amane, so go ahead, but…
        <p></p>j-just d-don't tickle me, okay?"
        <p></p>Mahiru looked up at him, still leaning close against him,
        <p></p>seemingly completely unaware of her own weaponized
        <p></p>charm.
        <p></p>Her words, her expression, her gaze, her posture, her
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>sweet scent carved away powerfully at Amane's sense of
        <p></p>reason. If he received one more push, the stronghold of his
        <p></p>judgment would simply crumble away.
        <p></p>For the moment, he bit his lip, and the pain barely kept
        <p></p>him in check. Then he peered into Mahiru's eyes. He could
        <p></p>see his own reflection in them, which held no doubt or
        <p></p>suspicion.
        <p></p>"…I can touch you?" 8
        <p></p>"Wh-why, is there a reason why you shouldn't? I'm sure I
        <p></p>asked you before to please touch me. And I think you have a
        <p></p>right to touch the same parts on me that I did on you. Wwe're a couple, so it's fine, right…?" 2
        <p></p>"N-no, well, I may just be a bad guy, but I think this
        <p></p>situation we're in is unwise… Do you understand?"
        <p></p>If they took one more step forward, they would never be
        <p></p>able to go back. He asked to be sure, since he had a feeling
        <p></p>Mahiru hadn't yet realized that, and after dramatically
        <p></p>blinking her caramel-colored eyes, Mahiru's face instantly
        <p></p>went up in flames like an on-demand water heater.
        <p></p>After opening and closing her mouth like she was trying to
        <p></p>say something but finding herself unable to string any words
        <p></p>together, Mahiru drew her legs up and hung her head. She
        <p></p>didn't seem like she was going to run away. But she did
        <p></p>appear to be ashamed or embarrassed and was bright red all
        <p></p>the way to her ears that were peeking out from beneath her
        <p></p>hair.
        <p></p>"Uh, ah, um… A-actually, maybe another day would be 1
        <p></p>better…," Mahiru managed to mutter in a hoarse, trembling
        <p></p>voice.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane looked away from her and nodded. "…That's what
        <p></p>I'd like, too… N-not that you can't touch me, but…it seems
        <p></p>like we're moving really fast, and I'm kind of scared of what
        <p></p>might happen."
        <p></p>Amane was determined to treasure their relationship and
        <p></p>to really value the time and experiences that they built up
        <p></p>together. He didn't think it would be good to skip over so
        <p></p>many steps and give in to their teenage instincts. That kind
        <p></p>of self-control was difficult for a high school boy like Amane,
        <p></p>and he worried that if she let down her guard, he would
        <p></p>likely carry her off to the bedroom. He didn't want to risk
        <p></p>losing Mahiru over something like that and resolved to resist
        <p></p>the temptation.
        <p></p>Mahiru's body coiled up again as she listened to Amane
        <p></p>squeeze out an explanation. She looked over at him, and he
        <p></p>gently stroked her hair, enduring shame that he couldn't
        <p></p>hide.
        <p></p>"I'm begging you… I want to treasure you, so please, let's
        <p></p>take it slow," he mumbled quietly.
        <p></p>"I-I'll keep that in mind…," Mahiru answered bashfully in
        <p></p>a defeated voice. 4

        <p></p>Chapter 61: Don’t Feed the Animals 2
        <p></p>It had been one month since they started dating.
        <p></p>Amane, who hadn't even kissed anyone before, still wasn't
        <p></p>sure how he was supposed to touch Mahiru.
        <p></p>They'd held hands and hugged each other but hadn't
        <p></p>taken it any further than that.
        <p></p>Even though they had embraced the other day while he
        <p></p>was shirtless, nothing else had happened. Amane was sure
        <p></p>that if Itsuki somehow heard the story, he would be
        <p></p>subjected to plenty of teasing. Of course, Amane didn't agree
        <p></p>with Itsuki's judgment on the matter, but he also understood
        <p></p>why his friend might point out that it wasn't very manly.
        <p></p>Amane wanted to take their relationship to the next level,
        <p></p>but he was also afraid of moving forward. If she rejected his
        <p></p>advances, or if he hurt her and made her cry, Amane was
        <p></p>certain he would never recover from it. And he was terribly
        <p></p>worried that she would think he was a loser.
        <p></p>He glanced over at Mahiru, who was sitting beside him.
        <p></p>The day after she said it was all right to touch her, she was
        <p></p>fidgety and restless. However, several days had passed since
        <p></p>her remark, and perhaps she understood that Amane wasn't
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>going to try anything, because she had gradually returned to
        <p></p>her usual demeanor.
        <p></p>Even Amane thought it was weird that he was feeling
        <p></p>more awkward than her, but in the end, he couldn't help
        <p></p>being nervous.
        <p></p>"…Is something the matter?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had apparently noticed his gaze, and she looked
        <p></p>confused. She didn't seem to have noticed his internal
        <p></p>conflict.
        <p></p>"N-no, I was just… Well, I don't know how I'm supposed
        <p></p>to touch you, Mahiru."
        <p></p>He added quietly that he wanted to, but not carelessly, a
        <p></p>statement that sounded weak as soon as he said it.
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes widened as she recalled again what had
        <p></p>happened the other day, and her gaze shifted nervously.
        <p></p>Apparently she hadn't been thinking about it at all. Her
        <p></p>reaction made Amane laugh.
        <p></p>"So what do you want me to do?"
        <p></p>"…Is that something you should ask me?"
        <p></p>"W-well, you're the one getting touched, right? I don't
        <p></p>want to do anything you don't want, and I'd like to be as 2
        <p></p>gentle as possible toward you."
        <p></p>He'd prefer to avoid rushing ahead and acting on his own
        <p></p>feelings, because he knew that his conscience would never
        <p></p>let him rest if he made Mahiru uncomfortable. His parents
        <p></p>would certainly reprimand him if they ever found out.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Precisely because this was his first relationship, and there
        <p></p>was no room for error, Amane knew he should be as
        <p></p>considerate as possible, and since it would also really hurt
        <p></p>him if she cried or ended up hating him. He wanted to grant
        <p></p>all of Mahiru's wishes.
        <p></p>With his heart set on that, he stared back at Mahiru, who
        <p></p>squirmed like she wanted to run away but then leaned
        <p></p>against Amane's shoulder.
        <p></p>"I-it's fine; you can do whatever you like," she said. "Just
        <p></p>don't tickle me or pinch my belly."
        <p></p>"…You don't have anything to pinch, do you?"
        <p></p>"Well, I do keep a close eye on my figure, but whether or
        <p></p>not I have anything extra there, girls generally hate getting
        <p></p>their bellies squeezed by their boyfriends."
        <p></p>"Well, I don't plan on doing anything you would hate,
        <p></p>but…um, is it really okay?"
        <p></p>"I told you: It's fine."
        <p></p>Mahiru had stated definitively that he could do as he 1
        <p></p>pleased, but still, maybe she felt there was something a little
        <p></p>scary about allowing a guy to touch her however he wanted,
        <p></p>even if that guy was her boyfriend. Through the shoulder
        <p></p>that she was leaning on, Amane felt a slight shiver run 1
        <p></p>through her body.
        <p></p>He was happy she accepted him, but on the other hand, he
        <p></p>knew he would have to be careful because it would still be
        <p></p>problematic if he was pushy about it.
        <p></p>He really wanted to touch her but didn't know what to do,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>so after puzzling over it for a long ten seconds, Amane
        <p></p>pushed her up from his shoulder and embraced her gently
        <p></p>like he was trying to wrap himself around her whole body.
        <p></p>He could tell that her small frame was shaking and curling
        <p></p>up with surprise inside his arms, so in an effort to relax her,
        <p></p>with gentle, deliberate movements, he patted her back to
        <p></p>calm her down.
        <p></p>He didn't want to frighten her, and with that in mind, he
        <p></p>touched her with careful gestures. Mahiru relaxed and
        <p></p>leaned against him.
        <p></p>"…You don't have to worry; I won't do anything more."
        <p></p>"I-I'm not particularly scared… Just, well, first I'm
        <p></p>embarrassed, and…I was expecting more, I guess."
        <p></p>"Expecting…?"
        <p></p>"You know…a kiss or something."
        <p></p>Mahiru whispered the last bit weakly as she nuzzled her
        <p></p>cheek against Amane's chest, and this time it was his turn to
        <p></p>tremble.
        <p></p>"…A-Amane, I know you really love me, and that you've
        <p></p>been cherishing me like some treasured object, but…I want
        <p></p>to really feel your love." 5
        <p></p>Amane felt a swell of emotion at Mahiru's adorable words.
        <p></p>Although she always radiated of cuteness, she unconsciously
        <p></p>hit her boyfriend with an extra-large helping, and Amane's
        <p></p>head started spinning.
        <p></p>If he wasn't careful, he was going to grasp her tightly and
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>never let go, so he had to bite his lip hard and suppress that
        <p></p>urge.
        <p></p>"I know you don't want to rush me, and you're not going
