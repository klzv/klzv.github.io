        <hr class="half">
        <p></p>
        Casually, and without a hint of hesitation, Itsuki reached over and rested his hand<p></p>
        <p></p>
        between Chitose's knees as he embraced her. It was getting extremely difficult to look<p></p>
        <p></p>
        directly at the couple.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, why don't you get a room, you two?!" Amane shouted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, you jealous, Amane?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Psh, yeah right."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Rather than any sort of envy, Amane just wanted them out of his sight. He wished they<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would stop, but this sort of behavior was business as usual for the couple. Scolding<p></p>
        <p></p>
        them for it was a waste of energy at this point.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Looking very satisfied with herself as she clung to Itsuki, Chitose leaned against his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        chest and looked up at Itsuki's face. "…I bet everyone's flirting at their own parties<p></p>
        <p></p>
        right about now."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, don't forget you've got a guy right here crying bitter tears of loneliness," said<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There's no way everyone is acting like these two.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There had to be some people who were spending the holiday with family—and others<p></p>
        <p></p>
        who were spending it with friends. Surely there were even some spending the holiday<p></p>
        <p></p>
        completely alone. Amane felt like Chitose ought to choose her words more carefully.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Not everyone was lucky enough to spend Christmas with other people.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Do boys really want sweethearts that badly?" Chitose asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't think they do," Amane answered flatly. "I certainly don't."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, but…," Itsuki interjected, "you're an outlier."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shut up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, everyone gets restless right before Christmas, you know," Chitose continued.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Especially single guys. The other day, I asked the angel about her Christmas plans and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        found out she'd ruthlessly rejected just about every boy in school. She left 'em all<p></p>
        <p></p>
        brokenhearted because she supposedly already made plans with someone else."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh," Itsuki said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had a feeling that someone was him. The idea that he was little more than a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        diplomatic excuse to turn down other dates wasn't a pleasant one, but he knew that it<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pained Mahiru to have to refuse anyone. If having plans with Amane helped ease<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's conscience, then he supposed he couldn't object. After all, she wasn't giving<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his name out, so there shouldn't be any trouble.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All those poor boys looked so crushed. It was rude, but I laughed," Chitose recalled.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You shouldn't laugh!" Itsuki scolded playfully.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, using a holiday as an excuse to try to score a date with a girl you barely know<p></p>
        <p></p>
        is total crap, isn't it? They're already off to a late start 'cause they haven't built any kind<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of relationship, so they try to take a convenient little shortcut to get to where they<p></p>
        <p></p>
        really want to be. Plus, I bet those guys are the kind who'd say they were taking her to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a party with a lot of people but then create some excuse to be alone with her. It's a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        scary thing, for a girl."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose went on to add that the angel was certainly not the type to go along with those<p></p>
        <p></p>
        kinds of games anyway, then stuck out her tongue and clung to Itsuki even more, as if<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she'd touched on an unpleasant memory. Trendy and beautiful, Chitose had a different<p></p>
        <p></p>
        look than Mahiru. It wouldn't have been surprising to learn that she'd had some bad<p></p>
        <p></p>
        experiences with guys in the past. Amane felt a little sorry for her. Popular girls<p></p>
        <p></p>
        certainly had it rough.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It must be hard on Shiina, dealing with all those propositions," Amane said suddenly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…You're really not interested in the angel, are you, Amane?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Not really," Amane replied flatly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You already have that angelic next-door neighbor of yours, huh?" Chitose needled.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't think I won't kick you out of my apartment…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, don't! I'm sooo scaaared!" Chitose whined, clinging to Itsuki as she playfully<p></p>
        <p></p>
        glared at Amane. "So you're not denying that your neighbor has been taking care of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's words stuck in his throat, and Chitose grinned with smug satisfaction, though<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her expression quickly changed when she saw his face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't glare at me like that! Sorry, geez…" Chitose apologized in a tone that held very<p></p>
        <p></p>
        little remorse. When Amane narrowed his eyes at her a second time, she gave a cutesy<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shriek and clung to Itsuki again. Then she happened to look through the window<p></p>
        <p></p>
        behind her boyfriend.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Something outside was surprising enough for her to stare, so Amane also followed her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gaze and looked at the window, wondering what was going on. Little white flecks were<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wafting down from the blue sky.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Ah, Itsuki, look! Snow!" Chitose cried.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Whoa, a white Christmas!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Snow wasn't that unusual at the end of December, but it was rare to see any on such a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        clear day, and it seemed to delight the lovebirds.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was still daytime, and the temperature was only going to drop as the sun began to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        set. Christmas Eve was likely to be blanketed in snow this year. Couples all over town<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were likely rejoicing, and the couple in Amane's apartment had already stepped out<p></p>
        <p></p>
        onto his balcony for a better view.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm sure you're going to be making out over there for a while, so I'll fix you some warm<p></p>
        <p></p>
        drinks," Amane shouted as he watched Itsuki and Chitose head outside. As Amane was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        standing up, a hysterical shriek suddenly caught his ear.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh?! Wh-why are you here?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh, what?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The last voice in the bunch was one Amane had only become accustomed to hearing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        relatively recently. It rang clear and sweet.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane felt his stomach sink.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Aware that Itsuki and Chitose were huddling together on his veranda, Amane dashed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out in a panic and saw that Mahiru had also come out onto her own balcony to look at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the snow. In doing so, she had been spotted by Amane's friends the moment she'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        leaned over the railing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane looked at Mahiru, who was now sitting beside him, and sighed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Faced with the terrible disaster of everyone encountering each other on the balconies,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had been left with no other option but to invite Mahiru into his apartment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        No matter what Amane tried now, his two friends would definitely be suspicious. At<p></p>
        <p></p>
        this point, telling them the whole truth was probably the only way to avoid unnecessary<p></p>
        <p></p>
        speculations and misunderstandings. Things were bound to get worse if he couldn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        keep Itsuki and Chitose quiet about this, too.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Um, I really am sorry," Mahiru said gently.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You didn't do anything wrong."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was a white Christmas and also the first snow of the year. Of course Mahiru had gone<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to her veranda to take a look. No one could've blamed her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If Amane had heard the sound of her opening her glass door, he might have been able<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to do something, but there'd been music playing in the apartment, so he hadn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        noticed. Mahiru had likely been trying to stay quiet anyway.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose was staring at Amane and Mahiru as they reflected on their carelessness, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her eyes sparkled as she leaned in close. "So Amane's next-door neighbor was the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        angel all along?!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Um, please don't call me that…" True to form, Mahiru hated being called an angel to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her face and politely objected to the nickname, but Chitose was grinning from ear to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        ear, and it wasn't clear whether she was listening.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki, meanwhile, scratched his cheek and looked back and forth between Amane and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru, eyebrows raised. "Wow. So… just to recap, Shiina lives next door, and she's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been making you meals this whole time. Is that about right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Yeah," Amane admitted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "W-well… um, I had a favor to repay, and I could tell by looking at him that Fujimiya<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was not eating well, and that bothered me, so…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The two tried their best to explain how they first met and why they'd continued seeing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        each other. Itsuki acted like he understood but still wore an expression like he didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        quite comprehend it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane thought that if he were in Itsuki's position, he probably wouldn't be able to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        grasp the whole story, either. Who would believe that an incredible girl like Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would so casually decide to start caring for an unremarkable slob like Amane?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm, so I think I understand the situation, but what's really strange about all this is<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the idea that you don't have any ulterior motives toward Amane, Shiina. Like, you're<p></p>
        <p></p>
        basically acting as if you're his part-time wife," said Itsuki.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Guh!" Amane sputtered in surprise.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Wife?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wouldn't have chosen such a word, but he had to admit that their current<p></p>
        <p></p>
        interactions did somewhat resemble that sort of relationship. Mahiru made him<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dinner every night and had even treated him to lunch on a recent weekend. On top of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that, she sometimes helped him with cleaning. On the surface, it wasn't too far off from<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stereotypical married life. The important distinction was that neither Amane nor<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru harbored any romantic feelings for the other.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's eyes had also widened slightly at Itsuki's assessment, but she very quickly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        recovered from the shock, and Amane could see her slipping into her cordial public<p></p>
        <p></p>
        persona. "I can assure you that I have no such intentions whatsoever."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane realized that she was handling Itsuki and Chitose the same way she handled<p></p>
        <p></p>
        everyone else at school. Suddenly, he felt extremely embarrassed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's perfectly innocent," Amane added. "Shiina is just helping me out, okay?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If you say so, Amane. It's just… What a strange pairing. It's really a bit hard to swallow<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that such an incredible girl is cooking for you… Hey, that stuffed animal you bought,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was that also for her?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Maybe," Amane conceded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Whaaa—?!" Chitose broke into a shout.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, be quiet."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I haven't said anything yet, though?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Your face is loud enough."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Rude!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose's smirk was irritating. She looked incredibly pleased with herself for having<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "solved" this mystery. Up to this point, the conversation had proceeded without much<p></p>
        <p></p>
        teasing, and Amane was grateful for that. He certainly didn't need any unnecessary<p></p>
        <p></p>
        prodding right now, and Mahiru likely wouldn't be thrilled by the idea, either. Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had been hoping that Chitose would keep her mouth shut.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come on now; calm down, both of you." Itsuki put a stop to things before they really<p></p>
        <p></p>
        got out of hand. He'd picked up on the change in Amane's demeanor and was not the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        type to poke fun at his friend like Chitose would. Itsuki was the kind of guy who was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sensitive to how people felt. Of course, Amane wished he'd stopped before prying in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the first place, but that ship had sailed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After scolding Amane and Chitose, Itsuki turned back to Mahiru, who was sitting stiffly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on the sidelines, and bowed his head. "…Um, Shiina, thank you for taking care of our<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Since when did I become your kid?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I should be thanking you, for being such dear friends to Fujimiya," Mahiru answered<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gracefully.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "C'mon, not you, too! You're making me sound like a worthless jerk."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You kinda are, though," Itsuki remarked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, screw you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He'd heard Itsuki say things like that to him before, but Amane was hardly in the mood<p></p>
        <p></p>
        right now. Mahiru could have joined in the banter, but she wisely kept silent and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smiled, content to watch the exchange between the two boys. She wasn't being quite<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as expressive as she was when she was alone with Amane, but that smile lifted the veil<p></p>
        <p></p>
        on her usual act just a little bit. Perhaps noticing, Itsuki looked befuddled.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane made a crack about Itsuki checking her out despite his being taken, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose started pouting and laid into Amane even harder. It was kind of funny, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had her head tilted in bemusement, so Amane downplayed his enjoyment and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        assumed a more relaxed pose.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…All right, look. We don't have a mushy-sweet relationship like you guys do, but I still<p></p>
        <p></p>
        need you both to understand that this could get really hairy if word got out," said<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Got it; say nothing to nobody." Evidently picking up on his friend's attempts to point<p></p>
        <p></p>
        out the potential danger, Itsuki quickly nodded in understanding, much to Amane's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        surprise.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You too, Chitose," Amane added.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not that much of a chatterbox, you know. Besides, no one would believe that such<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a cute girl is making dinner and stuff for you of all people."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, excuse me for being so undeserving…," Amane muttered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Geez, I didn't mean it like that!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was well aware that what Chitose was saying was true. It was difficult to accept<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that the star of the school was taking care of an ordinary schlub like him. If anyone did<p></p>
        <p></p>
        believe the story, they'd probably curse Amane's very name for being so undeserving<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of Mahiru's angelic attention. Amane was particularly imaginative when it came to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        visualizing that last part, which was why he really didn't want the truth about their<p></p>
        <p></p>
        relationship getting out. He could do without all the trouble.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose laughed at Amane's sudden humility. Then her gaze shifted to Mahiru, as if her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        eye had been drawn to something. Chitose let out a heavy sigh as she stared longingly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        at the other girl. Mahiru quickly turned uncomfortable, like she wasn't sure what to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        do.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Um, what is it?" she asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…It just struck me all over again. Shiina, you're ridiculously cute, aren't you?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh? Thank you very much…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Having praised Mahiru right to her face, Chitose continued to stare, scrutinizing every<p></p>
        <p></p>
        last bit of her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "This is my first time seeing you so close-up, but sure enough, you really are as beautiful<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as an angel, aren't you? Your face has a nice shape, and your skin is lovely and creamy.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Plus, your eyelashes are long, your hair is smooth, and you're slim but still curvy!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh, um…?" Mahiru managed, flustered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane sighed deeply. He couldn't deal with Chitose when she got like this. While the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        girl definitely had her merits, there sure were some things he couldn't stand about her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He couldn't put up with her high-energy personality or the fact that she was always<p></p>
        <p></p>
        butting into other people's business.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had a particular appreciation for how difficult she could be because he had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        someone similar in his family. It was all the ways in which Chitose reminded him of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        his mother that really drove him crazy. Undeniably, Chitose resembled Amane's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mother in taste and disposition; she was obsessed with cute things.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Wow, seriously, looking closely, you're an incredible beauty—and so cute! Hey, hey,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        can I touch your hair? I mean, do you have a secret to getting your hair so smooth and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shiny? What shampoo and conditioner do you use?" Chitose pressed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Wait, ah, um… so sudden…," Mahiru stammered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Your skin's so soft, too. What kind of regimen do you follow to keep it like this?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose, who seemed caught between a desire to share beauty secrets and a want to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        poke and prod at the beautiful girl, stretched out a hand toward Mahiru as she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bombarded her with questions.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane felt sorry for Mahiru, who, despite her discomfort, was powerless against the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        onslaught. Cursing under his breath, Amane lightly bonked Chitose on the head. It was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a just a tap, since the goal was simply to get Chitose to cool her heels, but she'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apparently been caught by surprise as she cried "Oww!" and drew her hand back away<p></p>
        <p></p>
        from Mahiru. As for Mahiru, she seemed relieved by Amane's intercession. He'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        forgotten about it because she was conducting herself with her usual angelic poise,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but Mahiru was extremely wary around people she wasn't used to. Chitose was a girl,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        so Mahiru wasn't as wary as she had been with Amane, but her fear of strangers was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        still quite clear.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I can't believe you did that!" Chitose whined.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "She's shy, and you've only just met her, so stop trying to touch her," Amane chided.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I can touch her once we get to know each other?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You'll need to ask Shiina about that. Be respectful."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had obviously been getting ready to make a run for it. It was a good thing he'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stepped in. Even Chitose seemed to understand why she should stop when she saw<p></p>
        <p></p>
        how clearly shaken Mahiru was.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm sorry; I got too excited and almost did something without asking," Chitose<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apologized.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, mm-hmm…" Mahiru still seemed upset by the close call, and she looked at Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as if she didn't know what to do, her eyes pleading for help.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh, Shiina, Chitose can be sorta a handful, but she's not a bad person… I think," Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        explained.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is that supposed to be a compliment?" the excitable girl snapped.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Look at the way you were acting. Can you really argue?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nope!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose, having just openly disavowed her own actions, stared at Mahiru for a moment,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        then once again extended a hand toward her, wearing a very serious expression.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "In that case, it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance!" This time, however, she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        presented Mahiru with an open hand.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh? Y-yeah, nice to meet you…" Mahiru hesitantly accepted the handshake.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Once Chitose took a liking to someone, Amane knew she was determined to be their<p></p>
        <p></p>
        friend, whether they wanted it or not. Something told Amane that Mahiru would be<p></p>
        <p></p>
        swayed by Chitose's persistence. Really, as long as she didn't do anything too weird in<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her pursuit of Mahiru's friendship, Amane didn't mind. An ordinary, low-key<p></p>
        <p></p>
        relationship was best.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "First impressions are so important for becoming good friends, you know! You<p></p>
        <p></p>
        probably already know who I am, and I'm sure you've heard my name from Amane,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but I'm Chitose Shirakawa. I'm Itsuki's girlfriend. I guess you could call him… Amane's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        best friend?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh my, I'm blushing! A best friend, wow," Itsuki ribbed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't act so flattered, Itsuki; it's weird," Amane shot back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "There you go again… Hey, Amane, they've got a name for people like you, y'know…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sweet and sour!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'll seriously kick you out."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Forcing us outside in the snow? Oh, how cruel!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't try to wheedle your way out of this one."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki cackled with laughter, and Amane looked even more annoyed. Mahiru's eyes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        went wide as she watched their exchange.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, we always act like this," Itsuki informed her as he smiled cheerfully. "So anyway,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I'm Itsuki Akazawa. I'm best friends with that knucklehead over there. If Amane ever<p></p>
        <p></p>
        does anything stupid or weird, you can come talk to me any time."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Is that any way to talk about your best friend?" Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Well, Fujimiya doesn't seem to have any interest in me," Mahiru said. "He may not<p></p>
        <p></p>
        have any basic life skills, but he's an otherwise ordinary guy, so I'm not expecting any<p></p>
        <p></p>
        trouble."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thanks, I guess… but you could have left out the part about me being incompetent."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane could have gone without that specific remark, but he was happy to hear that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru did indeed see him as a person she could trust.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki drew close and whispered in Amane's ear, "You've gotten awfully close to Shiina<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for somebody who says he's not interested."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane would be lying if he said he wasn't interested at all, but he really wasn't actively<p></p>
        <p></p>
        trying to steer their relationship in that direction. He was certain that Mahiru just<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wanted a close friend, not a romantic partner. The two of them were happy spending<p></p>
        <p></p>
        their time together as they had been.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Glancing at Mahiru, Amane saw that she'd gotten all flustered again. Chitose had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        begun another round of interrogation, having decided her conversation with Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was over.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        However, Mahiru didn't seem to hate the attention, and Amane hoped that maybe<p></p>
        <p></p>
        when she got more comfortable, she might relax a little.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As bewildered as she was, Mahiru responded to the barrage of questions with a small<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smile. It came as no small relief for Amane that the two girls were getting acquainted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        without any issue.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm really sorry."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After night had fallen, and Itsuki and Chitose had gone home, Amane apologized to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru, who looked more than a little worn-out.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was obvious that Mahiru had been left exhausted and confused after dealing with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        two strangers who'd just discovered their secret. This conversation felt like an exact<p></p>
        <p></p>
        repeat of the one they'd had after Shihoko's surprise visit.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, my own carelessness was what caused it, after all," Mahiru refuted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "They sure did make a fuss."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "They're… lively people."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You can be honest; they're both loudmouths."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "They were a little assertive, but they're interesting."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "'A little' is being very generous… Well, as long as you didn't mind, I guess it's all good."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was convinced that his friends' behavior had crossed the line for Mahiru, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the mild-mannered girl was taking it all in stride. He was glad that she hadn't found<p></p>
        <p></p>
        them too troublesome, but he wasn't sure whether it was a good thing that she and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose were apparently becoming friends.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose is a totally different type of girl from Mahiru. Very… energetic? Which is nice, I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        suppose. He trusted Chitose not to do anything malicious, but he would need to keep<p></p>
        <p></p>
        an eye on her to be certain she gave Mahiru enough space.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't have any people like that in my life, so it was kind of fun."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Right, I imagine you don't really have anyone like Chitose in your circle… If she gets<p></p>
        <p></p>
        too persistent, you can just slap her, okay?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I w-would never resort to violence, so I'll do my best to keep her in check with my<p></p>
        <p></p>
        words."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose had an excess of energy and often let her enthusiasm get the better of her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was sure that eventually his advice would be warranted. As he fixed in his mind<p></p>
        <p></p>
        an oath to caution Chitose directly the next time he saw her, Amane turned toward the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        window and watched the snow fluttering down.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If it weren't for this weather, we never would've been discovered, he thought. Snowflakes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were supposed to carry good tidings for lovers everywhere, however, so Amane didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        think it right to curse them for his troubles.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru also seemed to enjoy watching the snow because, once she realized what<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was looking at, she stared out the window in the exact same way.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was winter, so the sun had set early. The sky was dark, and the snow was pale, and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he could just barely see the flakes falling in the light coming from the surrounding<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apartment buildings.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "A white Christmas, huh?" Mahiru said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, I guess so," Amane answered. "Though, that sappy stuff doesn't have much to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        do with us."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's still very pretty. Isn't that enough?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Spending a romantic white Christmas together didn't mean anything to them, since<p></p>
        <p></p>
        they weren't a couple, but… Mahiru seemed to be enjoying the sight anyway, so the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        snow couldn't be all bad.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The dancing snowflakes lightly dusted the surroundings, leaving the dark world<p></p>
        <p></p>
        coated in a powdery whiteness. At the rate it was falling, the chance of the snow really<p></p>
        <p></p>
        piling up didn't seem very high.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If it's too heavy, though, public transit will shut down, so I hope it's only a light snow,"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru commented.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's very pragmatic of you," Amane remarked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "People can't survive on romance alone," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're exactly right."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Albeit in an unusual way, the snow had brought them closer together, after all.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They both smiled slightly, and Mahiru stood up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right then, I'll bring dinner over."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh, bring it over?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I made beef stew at my place earlier. I thought for sure that if I roasted a whole turkey,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the two of us wouldn't be able to finish it…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It would never have even occurred to me to roast a turkey."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're just bad at cooking, Amane. For lunch tomorrow, I was thinking we could make<p></p>
        <p></p>
        omelet rices with beef stew on top."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That sounds so delicious…" Amane's mind had already leaped straight past tonight's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dinner and had started looking forward to tomorrow's lunch. "I like my eggs cooked<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hard."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What a coincidence; I've always preferred them that way, too. Okay, I'm bringing the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stew pot over."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru sauntered out of Amane's apartment and headed back to her own place for a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        moment. Vacantly, Amane watched her as she left, reflecting on the turbulent day.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He really hadn't expected to be discovered. His friends might have suspected that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something was up, and Amane had anticipated them growing curious, but he never<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would've expected that Mahiru would simply step right onto center stage.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Part of him wished that their relationship could've stayed their secret for just a little<p></p>
        <p></p>
        while longer.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        What am I thinking? Amane wondered. It was better this way. He no longer had to hide<p></p>
        <p></p>
        everything from Itsuki and Chitose, which made his life much easier. So then why did<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he feel a bit wistful? Where was this strange feeling coming from? Though everything<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had turned out okay, some part of Amane was still agitated, and he needed to relax.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Did something happen?" Mahiru had returned, holding the stew pot, and she tilted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her head questioningly as she stared at Amane with a confused look.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…It's nothing." Amane straightened out his expression, but Mahiru still seemed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        puzzled for a good while by the expression she had spotted on his face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Phew, that was good."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Unsurprisingly, Mahiru's cooking had been delicious. With it being Christmas, she had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        made even more elaborate dishes than usual. She had turned the rest of her carefully<p></p>
        <p></p>
        simmered beef stew into a pot pie, which she and Amane had shared.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Splitting the pie open and eating the crispy, textured crust together with the rich sauce<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of the beef stew could only be described as a moment of sublime bliss.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had apparently prepared the pie dough especially for this. Truly impressed by<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her culinary prowess, Amane loosed a contented sigh while polishing off his second<p></p>
        <p></p>
        pastry of the day, another product of Mahiru's skilled hands.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        While making the dough for the pot pie, Mahiru had apparently taken the opportunity<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to prepare another type of sweet dough at the same time. She'd used it to make<p></p>
        <p></p>
        handmade mille-feuille for dessert. This girl was already working at a professional<p></p>
        <p></p>
        level.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm glad you like it… You sure ate plenty," Mahiru observed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm. Because it was delicious," Amane replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Thank you for saying so."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had grown accustomed to seeing the faint, relieved smile that emerged on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's face whenever he complimented her food. He had made it his daily mission<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to see that expression, as it was so much softer than her usual reserved countenance.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Though an embarrassing thought, Amane liked to think of it as a special kind of smile<p></p>
        <p></p>
        reserved just for him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…So tomorrow we're having omelets over rice, huh…? I'm really looking forward to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You really do like eggs, don't you? You tore into those rolled dashi omelets with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        incredible enthusiasm."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "They were delicious; I couldn't help it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even though eggs were one of his favorite foods, Amane couldn't stand them if they<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were badly cooked. The fact that he'd wolfed them down was just more proof of<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's excellent preparation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Though Amane recognized that it was awfully selfish to be keeping her cooking all to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        himself, he was not inclined to share with anybody else. The plan was to keep enjoying<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it for as long as possible.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Amane, you look super happy when you're eating, you know?" Mahiru said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Of course, because your cooking is so good," he replied.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm flattered, but… really, it's nothing that special."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, it definitely is… You need to get a better sense of your own worth…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        This was the homemade food of an angel; there were more than a few boys who'd do<p></p>
        <p></p>
        anything to have some.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But to me, this is just the stuff I make every day."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm a lucky guy."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Why's that?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Because the stuff you make every day is so delicious."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was a boy ruled by his stomach, and being able to enjoy delicious, freshly made<p></p>
        <p></p>
        meals so regularly was, for him, the ultimate happiness.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How did you get so good at cooking anyway?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Someone important to me once said 'Make sure you grab anyone who makes you<p></p>
        <p></p>
        happy by the stomach,' and I took those words to heart," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry you ended up grabbing me instead."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm thinking of it as a rehearsal." Mahiru's candor caught Amane by surprise. A small<p></p>
        <p></p>
        smile spread across her lips.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…But seriously, whoever taught you must have been amazing."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's right; they were an incredible cook. I'm still no match for them. Their cooking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        tasted like pure happiness." Mahiru took on a faraway look with a gentle smile. The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expression felt reassuring to Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        From the way Mahiru described it, the person in question had obviously loved her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        very much, and Amane could tell that Mahiru had idolized them as well. She must have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        been really lucky to have someone like that in her life.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I bet it was really good," Amane said, nodding. "But you know… to me, your cooking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        is what tastes like happiness."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Leaving his mother aside for the moment, Amane's father was a decent cook, but<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's dishes suited Amane's tastes better. Mahiru's cooking was comforting yet<p></p>
        <p></p>
        exciting, with a relaxing flavor that he didn't think he could get tired of, even if he had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it three times a day for the rest of his life. No matter how much he ate, he just wanted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        more and more.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Though, of course, he could never say that. It'd put too much of a burden on Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Suddenly, the girl stiffened. She looked like she'd been attacked in an unguarded<p></p>
        <p></p>
        moment. She stared at Amane with an innocent and somewhat vacant expression.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Mahiru?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah… it's nothing." Snapping back to her senses, Mahiru quickly shook her head, then<p></p>
        <p></p>
        stared down at the floor. Hugging her favorite cushion tight, she let out a soft sigh.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Something about her had completely changed in the last few seconds. It was strangely<p></p>
        <p></p>
        endearing.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What's up?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…It's just—to think that someone like me could make something taste like happiness…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I don't know why you're putting yourself down, but your food is so good that I want<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to eat it every day."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Th-thank you." Mahiru looked up at Amane with a bit of a bashful look and a small<p></p>
        <p></p>
        grin. The sight of it filled Amane with the urge to hide his face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        This kind of expression was rare for Mahiru, but it inevitably set Amane's heart<p></p>
        <p></p>
        rattling in his chest, even though he'd constantly told himself that he wasn't interested<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in her like that. Seeing Mahiru's smiling visage stripped of its usual stony mask made<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him suddenly feel hot, and Amane worried that she would notice and get embarrassed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        herself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Say, um, Mahiru?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yes?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Tomorrow we'll be meeting up around lunchtime, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Unable to stand the atmosphere any longer, Amane forced a change of subject. Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        didn't seem to take much notice, however, and she idly considered what Amane had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yes, that's the plan, isn't it? We'll make lunch, then play games like we promised…<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That was it, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Unless… you don't want to?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, I was just confirming. Really, even though we spent Christmas Eve together, are<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you sure it's okay to spend your next day with me, too?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "If I hated the idea, I wouldn't have suggested it… I'm looking forward to it." Another<p></p>
        <p></p>
        small smile appeared on the gentle curve of Mahiru's lips.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Y-yeah," Amane muttered. It was all he could do to turn away and hide his growing<p></p>
        <p></p>
        embarrassment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        You can chat with me about my writing experience apart from the comments section!<p></p>

        14 Christmas for Two<p></p>
        When Mahiru arrived at Amane's apartment the following day, she seemed a little<p></p>
        <p></p>
        restless. It would've been perfectly understandable to be nervous about visiting the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        home of a member of the opposite sex on a holiday, but that didn't seem to be it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru wants to play games. She's probably just excited.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, this would be her first time ever playing a video game. In some ways, she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was like a sheltered highborn young lady who knew little of the world at large.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Before we play, I'll make lunch, okay?" Mahiru confirmed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm. I'll have mine well-done, please," Amane answered casually.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I know; I remember."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even dealing with such a demanding customer didn't seem to dampen the girl's mood.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With a flutter of her apron, she headed for the kitchen and began preparations for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        lunch. From the way she was behaving, Mahiru seemed to be quite pleased.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane felt a little awkward and embarrassed about how much he had been looking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        forward to this.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It's just because I'm looking forward to enjoying the games, that's all, he told himself. <p></p>
        <p></p>
        It certainly was not that he had been excited about spending time alone with the
        <p></p>
        next-door angel. As he watched Mahiru's ponytail swaying back and forth,d<p></p>
        Amane smiled wryly to himself.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…How are you supposed to hold it?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After lunch, the two of them settled on the sofa in front of the TV. Both were now<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looking straight at the screen.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When Amane had asked her what game she wanted to play, it became apparent that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru didn't even know where to start, so he'd booted up a well-known 2D game and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        handed her a controller. Unfortunately, Mahiru immediately got flustered as it became<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apparent that she had no idea what to do with it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh, okay, so you move around with this joystick, and you jump with this button…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru, usually so calm and collected, was looking back and forth between the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        controller and the TV as she manipulated her character on-screen. It was obvious that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        this was her first time. She charged straight at the enemies without dodging, dying<p></p>
        <p></p>
        over and over again. Amane began to wonder if perhaps there were things even an<p></p>
