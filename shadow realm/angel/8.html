        to be open about her feelings. He liked her curt and annoyingly helpful attitude and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the reserved way she conducted herself. When she was taken by surprise, she would<p></p>
        <p></p>
        get flustered, and the mask would drop momentarily, which was another thing he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        enjoyed. Most of all, Amane especially liked that rare angelic smile that he'd only seen<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cross her face a few times. He supposed that each of those attributes were all precious<p></p>
        <p></p>
        parts of Mahiru's appeal.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        If he had to say whether that was a feeling of romantic love, Amane would have<p></p>
        <p></p>
        insisted that it was something else, but he couldn't deny that Mahiru was a wonderful<p></p>
        <p></p>
        girl for many reasons.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I care about her as a friend. Not every relationship between members of the opposite<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sex has to be romantic, you know. And I'm pretty sure she doesn't feel that way, either."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was not the kind of mama's boy who would obediently play along with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        whatever Shihoko said. Plus, Mahiru would certainly object to the suggestion that she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        had feelings for him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Now, you don't know that, Amane! Aren't you being rather presumptuous, thinking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you know exactly what her heart wants?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What can I say to get you to understand that our relationship is not like that, Mom…?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shiina, please, help me out here…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        No matter how he tried to explain, Amane's mother had already made up her mind.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane pressed a finger to his forehead, stumped on what to do. With all possible<p></p>
        <p></p>
        urgency, he wished Mahiru would just wake up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nn…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Either Amane's unspoken prayer had been heard or all the ruckus had, because<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's eyelids fluttered open, and she made a sweet noise as she raised her face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her flaxen hair slipped over her shoulders. The girl's shining eyes, the color of caramel,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        were blurry with sleep, and she looked so vulnerable that it felt somehow wrong to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        look directly at her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Maybe she wasn't quite fully awake yet as she looked up at Amane vacantly, her eyes<p></p>
        <p></p>
        still relaxed and drowsy. Amane pointedly stared in another direction.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shiina, I don't mind that you fell asleep, but there's been a misunderstanding, so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        please help me clear things up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Misunderstanding…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hey, hey, Miss Girlfriend, what's your name?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was still clearly confused over what had happened, but Shihoko didn't hesitate<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to approach her, beaming with an amiable, carefree smile and an overly familiar<p></p>
        <p></p>
        demeanor.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was visibly flustered, still trying to get her bearings.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh, uh, um…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's important to tell each other our names when we first meet, you know!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, I-I'm Mahiru Shiina…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, Mahiru, what a cute name that is! I am Shihoko; please don't be shy and call me<p></p>
        <p></p>
        by my first name, okay?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had reflexively given her name when pressed for it. She looked up at Amane,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her eyes begging him for rescue. Unfortunately, Amane was helpless. He had been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        hoping Mahiru would save him somehow. Regretfully, he shook his head. He knew that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        once his mother got started, there was really no stopping her. She was set on learning<p></p>
        <p></p>
        more about Mahiru, and nothing would dissuade her now. It was unlikely she'd ever<p></p>
        <p></p>
        realize just how uncomfortable she was making the poor girl.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "A-all right, um… Mrs., that is, uh, Shihoko…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "See? That sounds more like my daughter-in-law."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Fujimiya!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That could be referring to either of us, you know? Right, Amane?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mom, you're bothering Shiina."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Amane, you mustn't be so formal with your sweet new girlfriend; call her by her first<p></p>
        <p></p>
        name!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shihoko didn't seem inclined to listen to anything anyone said. Amane scowled at her,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but she didn't show any sign of letting up. Her smile was wide and utterly shameless.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh, um, Shihoko?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yes, dear?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "He and I—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Why, I don't know who you mean. He who?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…A-Amane and I; we aren't dating."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Even though she was obviously flustered by his mother's verbal assault, Mahiru tried<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her best to set the record straight. Unfortunately, she'd looked right at Amane and had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        even been forced to call him by his first name, which was apparently exactly what<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shihoko had been after. The older woman's smile grew even wider.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I suppose it takes time for things like this to blossom. Something to look forward<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to," Shihoko said, quite presumptuously.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Eh, ah, um, that's not…," Mahiru said, trying to object.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh no, I must have intruded just when things were getting good!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "U-um, I want you to let me explain properly! I don't have that kind of relationship<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with… Amane. We were just having lunch together because Amane can't cook!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What a wonderful bride you'll make, sweetie. My Amane set out to live on his own<p></p>
        <p></p>
        even though he's incapable of doing any kind of housework, you see. So I really do<p></p>
        <p></p>
        appreciate you supporting him."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, uh—"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had put up a heroic effort, but she may as well have been banging her head<p></p>
        <p></p>
        against a wall at this point. The moment she'd mentioned visiting Amane's place,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cooking there, and sitting at the same table as him, the sparkle in Shihoko's eyes had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        changed. The pushy mother somehow looked even more unhinged than usual to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Once Shihoko got like this, he knew there was nothing he could do to stop her. The<p></p>
        <p></p>
        only person who ever stood a chance was his father, Shuuto.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shiina, just give up. My mother won't listen to anyone when she gets like this."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You can't be serious…" Mahiru sounded extremely dismayed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane realized that they weren't getting anywhere. Trying to explain the situation<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wasn't working, and he clearly couldn't stop his mother's wild speculations.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "At any rate, my Amane did quite well to snag such a beauty. I'm surprised."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With Amane exhausted from arguing, and Mahiru having no clear idea what to do,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        both simply went quiet.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was possible Amane's mother took their sudden silence as a sign of agreement,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        though Shihoko had doubtlessly already assumed that their embarrassment was proof<p></p>
        <p></p>
        enough of her suspicions. She was looking at Mahiru with no attempt to hide the wild<p></p>
        <p></p>
        curiosity in her eyes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What do you think, Mahiru? Can my Amane really make it, living on his own?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh… That's… Well…," Mahiru stammered. "…Enough to stay alive…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You should've just said I'll be fine!" Amane interjected.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I remember the place being pretty bad," Mahiru reminded him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't bring that up. I'm keeping it clean now, aren't I?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "And I've been helping you with the cleaning this whole time, haven't I?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's true, and I'm grateful for it," Amane admitted. "All of it, truly—the food, the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cleaning, and everything else." Mahiru was inarguably the reason that he'd been able<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to live so comfortably, and he would bow down in thanks to her without any hesitation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He knew that she wouldn't have done so much if she'd hated it, but he always strove<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to make his appreciate known.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As should've been expected by now, Amane's mother interpreted the exchange in a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        different light.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well now, Amane, so it wasn't just today's lunch! Mahiru's been doing everything for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you this whole time, you useless child. The way you speak to each other—it's like<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you're already living together!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No! How did you even reach that conclusion?! We only live next to each other!" Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        fired back.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Aha, so it was fate! Isn't that wonderful, Amane. You got me such a beautiful daughterin-law."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm not denying that she's beautiful and talented, but I'm totally against calling it fate<p></p>
        <p></p>
        or destiny or whatever!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Doesn't it sound more romantic that way?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's not what I'm bothered by! I'm telling you we don't have a romantic relationship<p></p>
        <p></p>
        at all!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "How persistent." Clearly, Shihoko was choosing to believe that Amane was still too<p></p>
        <p></p>
        embarrassed to admit the truth.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's face contorted into a progressively deeper grimace, and he heaved his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        heaviest sigh of the last few months. He couldn't recall how many times he'd suffered<p></p>
        <p></p>
        at the hands of his mother's wild imagination. Shihoko was really the kind of woman<p></p>
        <p></p>
        who just did whatever she wanted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As for Mahiru, the one who'd been caught unawares by the full weight of Shihoko's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        overwhelming enthusiasm, she could do little else than look helplessly back and forth<p></p>
        <p></p>
        between Amane and his mother, utterly bewildered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru, this is probably a parent's love talking, but my Amane isn't very good with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        words, and he isn't very up-front about his feelings, but he is faithful and gentlemanly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        I'd say he's a pretty good catch. Plus, he doesn't have any experience with girls, so<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you'll be able to get him to do whatever you want."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What on earth are you saying, Mom? Seriously, cut it out."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That last bit especially is none of her business, Amane thought angrily.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, it's true, isn't it? If not, then why haven't you had any other girlfriends? You<p></p>
        <p></p>
        resemble your father, so I don't think it's your looks. Maybe it's because you're a little<p></p>
        <p></p>
        immature?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's n-none of your business."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You really should try harder to act cool in front of Mahiru, you know."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I will not, and she's not interested, either," Amane protested.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, come now! Sweetie, you can train him to suit your own preferences, you know.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane cleans up pretty good if you dress him up."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shihoko, grinning madly, struck poor Mahiru again, who could do nothing but offer a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        vague sort of smile in return. Not even an angel could retaliate in a battle like this.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's mother was truly something else.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mom, you're bothering her. Please go home."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What a big man you've become, telling your mother to go home."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm serious, please. It's really obvious that you're making her uncomfortable."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh? Is that true, Mahiru?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Don't ask her; she'll definitely just say what you want to hear. Just this once, please<p></p>
        <p></p>
        head back. You can come back some other time."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, if you're going that far, I suppose I get the message. I did barge in while you were<p></p>
        <p></p>
        alone with your girlfriend, after all. It's only natural you'd be upset to lose your alone<p></p>
        <p></p>
        time."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Fine, you can explain it however you like. Just hurry up and go!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was beyond tired of arguing with his mother, and this whole situation had to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        be taking a toll on Mahiru as well. He looked over and saw that she also looked<p></p>
        <p></p>
        exhausted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Vowing internally to shower her with appreciation later, Amane shooed his mother<p></p>
        <p></p>
        away and got a look of sour disapproval in return. Even so, Shihoko didn't make an<p></p>
        <p></p>
        effort to stay, so at least she kind of cared, though it was obvious her view of reality<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was still quite different.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, Mahiru, let's exchange contact information, shall we? I want a full report later on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        how Amane's doing, among other things."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Uh, o-okay…?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In a last-ditch effort, Shihoko tried to sink her hooks in again. Caught in the woman's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        powerful momentum, Mahiru wound up exchanging contact information with her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Now Amane's mother would be able to reach her directly. The thought made Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        want to press a hand to his forehead.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Beaming wide, Shihoko gripped Mahiru's hand and reminded the girl to look after her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        son. Amane resolved to send his father a message later, asking him to rein Shihoko in.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm exhausted…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Sorry; she's like a hurricane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Shihoko hadn't stayed all that long, but she'd left the two completely ragged.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After flumping down on the couch, Amane put his head in his hands and sighed deeply.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru gingerly took a seat, too, but her usually perfect posture was bent and haggard.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had thought that the angel could handle anyone, but even she had no energy<p></p>
        <p></p>
        left after the encounter with his mother. He was unsure if he should try to apologize.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I really didn't want to let her go home still believing the wrong thing," Amane admitted.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, there's no real harm done…," Mahiru said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, I think there is… If she was acting like that, it probably means that she's taken a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        liking to you… One way or another, she's gonna be an issue…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was truly unfortunate that this was going to put a burden on Mahiru. Shihoko's love<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for all things adorable, coupled with her mistaking Mahiru for her son's girlfriend,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        almost certainly meant that Amane's mother would be finding new ways to poke her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        nose where it didn't belong in the days to come. Trouble was on the horizon.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shihoko really cares about you a lot, doesn't she?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's a nice way to put it, but sometimes she really just refuses to listen…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        More than just an overly affectionate parent, Shihoko doted and fawned on Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        even though he hated it. He knew he shouldn't complain too much, since it was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        probably at least partly his own fault because he was such hopeless slob. It wasn't as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        though he was ungrateful for all his mother had provided, but she could be a real pain<p></p>
        <p></p>
        in the butt, and he wished she'd give him more space.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…How nice," Mahiru mumbled quietly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane looked up at her. "What is?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Your mother is quite a character but also very kind."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That means she's loud and loves to meddle."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Even so, I think it's nice."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's words weren't an empty compliment; she really did seem envious as she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mumbled and averted her eyes.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A gloomy expression was plain on the girl's face. So much so that Amane thought she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        might break down into tears at the drop of a hat. Anyone could have sensed how fragile<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she was right now. It was clearly more than simple exhaustion.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru must have noticed Amane looking at her, because she suddenly looked up and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        forced her lips into a small smile. Then, just as quickly, she regained her usual<p></p>
        <p></p>
        composure and leaned back against the sofa, something she rarely did.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru, huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…What are you saying all of a sudden?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nothing… I was just thinking that it's been a while since anyone called me by my first<p></p>
        <p></p>
        name. Most people only address me by my family name."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was pretty surprising to know that someone who seemed as popular as Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        didn't actually have any friends close enough to call her by her first name. Everyone at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        school saw her as a flawless angel. Even Mahiru's acquaintances probably maintained<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some degree of formality with her, and nobody had the courage to really get to know<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her. A lot of students only ever addressed her by a nickname that Mahiru herself didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        even like.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, I guess if you don't have any close friends, that would leave only your parents,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        right?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "My parents would never talk to me that way. Absolutely not." Mahiru's reply was cold.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Looking her over, Amane saw that Mahiru's face was an expressionless mask. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        resembled a beautiful doll, completely devoid of feeling. That, too, only lasted a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        second, however, and Mahiru's visage changed again when she noticed that Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was looking at her. Her eyebrows lowered, as if she was troubled by something.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Anyway, it doesn't happen often," she muttered, before letting out a sigh.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had been wondering for a while if Mahiru had a bad relationship with her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        parents. It had been easy enough to imagine that she had problems at home from her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        frosty demeanor whenever he touched on the subject. Plus, she never went out to eat<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with her parents and hated her own birthdays, but Amane never would've thought<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's parents were so distant as to not even call the girl by her first name.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Thinking back to how Mahiru had quietly said she enjoyed Shihoko's personality,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wondered how the angel must have felt in that moment.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mahiru." Rather suddenly, Amane blurted out the word. He'd never called his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        neighbor by her first name before. The girl in question blinked her caramel eyes. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looked stunned, and Amane could tell that he'd caught her off guard. The momentary<p></p>
        <p></p>
        surprise had revealed a youthfulness about Mahiru that she normally kept hidden.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's your name. Someone ought to call you by it," Amane reasoned.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I suppose you're right," Mahiru answered bluntly. A few moments later, a tiny smile<p></p>
        <p></p>
        appeared. Amane's chest felt fluttery when he spotted it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Amane."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        When he heard her small voice pronounce his own first name, the flutter turned to a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        storm. Maybe it was because, until just a moment ago, his mom was the one calling<p></p>
        <p></p>
        him by his first name, but when Mahiru called him by his first name face-to-face, he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        felt the uneasy, impatient stirring in his chest churn and roar.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Please don't call me that outside, okay?" Mahiru reminded.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I already wasn't planning to. That goes for you, too. Don't slip up outside the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apartment."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Understood. It's our secret, right?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane couldn't bring himself to look directly at Mahiru, as she was still grinning a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        little. Looking away, he responded in agreement and shifted in his seat, turning away<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to escape the angel's smile.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Though Shihoko's Saturday invasion had been a nightmare, nothing much had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        changed aside from how Amane and Mahiru referred to each other.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        They hadn't suddenly become any closer. Addressing each other a little more directly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        wasn't a big deal. At most, perhaps Mahiru's demeanor had softened a little, but that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was it.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Um, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had come over earlier than usual for dinner on Sunday, perhaps feeling a little<p></p>
        <p></p>
        uneasy, because she looked troubled.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane was glad to let her in, but he was confused by her peculiar attitude. He'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        thought that maybe using their first names didn't sit right with her after all, but when<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the time had come, she'd said his name without hesitation, so there must have been<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something else bothering her.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        For the time being, they sat on the sofa together, and as he waited to see what Mahiru<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would do, she pulled a handkerchief from her skirt pocket.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As Amane continued to wonder what was up, Mahiru opened the neatly folded<p></p>
        <p></p>
        handkerchief to reveal a tarnished silver key. It must have been the one he'd given her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the day before.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I'm returning your spare key. In the end, I never got the chance to use it, and then I<p></p>
        <p></p>
        forgot to give it back. I'm very sorry about that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I see."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Apparently, Mahiru hadn't been able to rest until she'd returned the key. Satisfied that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he understood the cause for her strange behavior, Amane stared at the bit of metal<p></p>
        <p></p>
        resting on the handkerchief.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Now that he thought about it, Mahiru came over to fix dinner in his apartment almost<p></p>
        <p></p>
        every night. Usually, he met her at the door, but sometimes it took him a while. There'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        even been times where Mahiru had been forced to wait because he wasn't home. It<p></p>
        <p></p>
        must have been inconvenient for her to have to wait outside for him, especially during<p></p>
        <p></p>
        these colder months. Somewhere, Amane had heard that chilly weather was a girl's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        worst enemy, and now that he thought about it, he wouldn't have been too happy<p></p>
        <p></p>
        waiting in the cold, either, had the situation been reversed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Since Mahiru was basically coming over every day, he wondered if it wouldn't be easier<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for her to have a key to get in.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's fine; I think you should keep it," he said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You can give it back to me whenever we stop spending time together."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It seemed perfectly reasonable to Amane. Now that Mahiru had the key, she might as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        well keep it—but she didn't seem convinced.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "B-but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I mean, going to the door every time you come over is a hassle."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Ah, so that's what this is about."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I doubt you're going to misuse it or anything."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, that's true, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane had been sharing meals with Mahiru for more than a month now, and he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        figured that he knew her pretty well. She was sensible, considerate, and kind. He was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        certain that she would never hand the key over to anyone else or do anything while<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane wasn't around. If there was anyone he could trust, it was Mahiru.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Besides, you must think it's a pain to have to ring the buzzer and wait out there all<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the time," Amane said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Even if it is, I feel like you're being a bit careless."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "But I'm giving it to you because I trust you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        At that, Mahiru's eyes went wide, and she floundered for words. Confusion, along with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something else that Amane didn't really understand, passed over the girl's delicate<p></p>
        <p></p>
        features.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The truth of it was that Amane had only wanted her to have the key to save himself<p></p>
        <p></p>
        some trouble, but if she really hated the idea, he was prepared to back down.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        As for Mahiru, she looked intently back and forth between Amane and the key for a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        few moments, then finally let out a gentle sigh.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Understood. I'll hold on to it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Mm."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You know, I'm never sure if something is a big deal to you, or if you even care at all,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane," Mahiru jabbed with a slightly prickly tone. She sounded fed up, and Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        couldn't do anything but smile wryly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Suits me well, don't you think?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You shouldn't say things like that about yourself," Mahiru admonished.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane's smile grew wider. Mahiru seemed to be growing more comfortable with this<p></p>
        <p></p>
        kind of silly back-and-forth. They were now on a first-name basis, of course. It<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would've been strange if they hadn't built up some kind of rapport. While Mahiru's<p></p>
        <p></p>
        eyes were still full of exasperation, as if to say that Amane was really a hopeless case,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        her gaze wasn't cold. In fact, there was a noticeable bit of warmth to it. She understood<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that Amane was just joking around.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "All right then, I won't hesitate to use this. I might even do something to your<p></p>
        <p></p>
        apartment without telling you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Like what?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Like… a surprise cleaning!"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I would be grateful for that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Or how about if your fridge was suddenly packed full of food?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It'd make breakfast easier, and we'd have more options for dinner, too."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's idea of a prank clearly needed some work. Amane would've been glad to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        suffer under any one of her suggestions. That she couldn't come up with a real threat<p></p>
        <p></p>
        even when she truly tried only reminded Amane of Mahiru's gentle nature. It was quite<p></p>
        <p></p>
        charming and brought a smile to his lips.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Are you sure you're not making fun of me?" Mahiru looked like she ready to pout,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        which would've been cute in its own right, but Amane didn't want to upset Mahiru any<p></p>
        <p></p>
        further.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Suppressing the grin that threatened to break out, Amane said, "Course not."<p></p>
        <p></p>

        11 A Reward for the Angel<p></p>
        "Well, guess that's how it goes," Amane grumbled as he looked the list of names up and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        down. The rankings for the previous week's tests were out, so Amane had shown up<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to check them like the rest of his class.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Coming in at twenty-first, Amane was situated around his usual score. It was a good<p></p>
        <p></p>
        enough ranking but hardly a result that stood out. He hadn't found this exam any more<p></p>
        <p></p>
        challenging than previous ones, though it was still a relief to see he'd done as well as<p></p>
        <p></p>
        he'd expected.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Surprising no one, Mahiru reigned over all the rest from her typical first-place<p></p>
        <p></p>
        position. She truly was a genius, but Amane knew perfectly well that she didn't attain<p></p>
        <p></p>
        that position without applying herself. Amane had often seen her studying after<p></p>
        <p></p>
        dinner. He wasn't about to argue that Mahiru wasn't smart, but he felt confident that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        it was the hard work that put her at the top more than anything else.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Shiina is first again, huh?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Of course she is. The angel's on a whole different level."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Such proclamations caused Amane to make a sour face.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…What's with that look? Was your rank that bad?" Itsuki came over, puzzled by his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        friend's odd expression.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Only the top fifty test scores had been posted. As such, Itsuki hadn't come to see his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        own score, but rather, to accompany Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's nothing. I'm twenty-first."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh? Isn't that better than last time?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Only by a little. Gotta consider the margin of error."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Whoa, you clever people even speak differently compared with us common folk."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Itsuki grinned.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Yeah, yeah." Amane ignored his friend's sarcasm and turned back to the class<p></p>
        <p></p>
        rankings. He knew Mahiru really gave it her all when it came to studying. She didn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        like all that effort to show, however, so she worked tirelessly in secret to make her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        success look like it came naturally. Others might've praised her or called her a genius,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but since they didn't know about all the behind-the-scenes struggling, they couldn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        recognize her actual accomplishments.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That must have been an oppressive way for Mahiru to live.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I should at least do something," Amane whispered.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm? What'd you say?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nothing. Come on, let's go back to class."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "'Kay."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh? What's this, Amane?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru had gone to the supermarket and returned with dinner ingredients. When<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she'd started to put them in the refrigerator, a conspicuously unfamiliar white box had<p></p>
        <p></p>
        caught her eye.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Hmm? Ah, it's a cake."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        It was likely that Mahiru already had an inkling as to the box's contents based on its<p></p>
        <p></p>
        shape, but she'd gone ahead and asked anyway. Amane had gone to a patisserie that<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Chitose talked about a lot on social media to buy the cake.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Do you like cake?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Not really. I bought it for you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "What? Why?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I thought it would be nice as a little celebration, because you were top of our year on<p></p>
        <p></p>
        the test. It's to congratulate you."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru quickly blinked a few times, unable to process that the cake was for her. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looked quite taken aback.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "B-but I get top rank every time, so it's not really something to celebrate," she protested.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, you're always working hard, so I thought it might be nice to get a reward for<p></p>
        <p></p>
        once. It's a shortcake. I hope you like that."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Huh? I mean… I don't hate it or anything…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Great. Have some after dinner."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        While Mahiru still looked a bit troubled, Amane cut the conversation off there. He'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        decided that it would be best to act like this was no big deal, since Mahiru always<p></p>
        <p></p>
        seemed troubled when people treated her like she was special.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru was the type of person who would exhaust herself taking care of someone else<p></p>
        <p></p>
        but then neglect herself. Amane had never once seen the girl do anything enjoyable<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for her own sake, and whenever anyone praised her or showed appreciation, she'd<p></p>
        <p></p>
        just redouble her efforts and run herself down.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Simply put, Mahiru was not good at accepting kindness from others. Amane hadn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        known her for all that long, but he was sure that much was true. That's why he wanted<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to return just a little bit of the kindness she was always showing him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane smiled again as Mahiru got everything ready in the kitchen and began cooking<p></p>
        <p></p>
        for that night.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        After dinner, Mahiru put the cake on a plate and brought it over to the coffee table with<p></p>
        <p></p>
        a nervous expression. Amane couldn't help but chuckle at the sight.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Wh-why are you laughing?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Nothing. Don't worry about it."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It doesn't seem like nothing."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's fine—stop worrying."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane found it amusing that Mahiru was acting so stiff, but his laughter clearly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bothered her. He was supposed to be showing her some appreciation, not making fun<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of her, so Amane quickly shut up.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru set the cake and the coffee she had brought along with it on the low table, then<p></p>
        <p></p>
        sat down on the sofa.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Her movements were still slightly stilted, and Amane felt another fit of laughter<p></p>
        <p></p>
        coming on, but Mahiru was sitting next to him now, so he did his best to quash the<p></p>
        <p></p>
        temptation.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A shy look in her eyes, Mahiru glanced up at Amane.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Right, so congratulations," he said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Thank you very much. But…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "It's fine; just enjoy it. You worked hard."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "That's true, but…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Come on, eat up. Even you should treat yourself to something nice once in a while."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The deed was done, and the cake was already here. Mahiru couldn't object to that. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        gave a small nod before picking up the plate of cake and a fork.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Very well, then I will gratefully accept this," she said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Please go ahead."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        With a nimble wave, Mahiru cut the cake into bite-size pieces with her fork and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        cautiously tried some. Amane imagined that girls were naturally very picky about<p></p>
        <p></p>
        their sweets, but since he'd gotten the cake from one of Chitose's favorite shops, he<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was fairly confident it was a good choice.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He knew his hunch was correct when he saw Mahiru's eyes widen slightly when she<p></p>
        <p></p>
        put the cake in her mouth, then the corners of her mouth relax slightly. Usually,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru's expressions really didn't change all that much, but recently, she'd become a<p></p>
        <p></p>
        bit more animated, or perhaps it was that Amane had gotten better at reading her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        emotions.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        The mellow, carefree face that Mahiru let show as she slowly savored her cake was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        one she made only while eating.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Hmm? Is something wrong?" She must have noticed Amane staring, and he quickly<p></p>
        <p></p>
        looked away.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "No, nothing," he answered hastily.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Now it was Mahiru's turn to stare at Amane. Suddenly, she snatched up the fork again,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as if an idea had just struck her. She stabbed one bite of cake and held it out toward<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane in a suggestive way. In other words, she was offering to feed him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Oh, um… no, thanks, I didn't really want any," Amane protested.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Really?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…No, well, um… if it's all right, I guess I'll have some, but, uh…" Amane certainly hadn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        expected this development. At a loss, he reflexively agreed.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A beautiful girl, hand-feeding him cake. For many adolescent boys, it would be a dream<p></p>
        <p></p>
        come true. Unfortunately, Amane's shyness prevented him from enjoying the situation<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as much as he would've liked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "You're the one who bought it in the first place, Amane, so you've got to have some,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        too."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Mahiru seemed entirely unaware of any of the implications behind her gesture. She<p></p>
        <p></p>
        maintained an ordinary, clueless expression as she held the cake out toward his<p></p>
        <p></p>
        mouth.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        There was no way he could turn her down, so Amane steeled himself and bit down.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        An incredibly sugary flavor instantly hit him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…This is crazy sweet," he said.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Well, it is cake."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        That wasn't what Amane had really been getting at, but Mahiru remained oblivious.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Sweetness spread through Amane's mouth as he chewed, but he was too preoccupied<p></p>
        <p></p>
        with something else to appreciate the flavor.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…This really doesn't seem weird to you, does it?" Amane questioned in a low voice.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        He was practically gagging on sweetness and shame, and Mahiru was acting like this<p></p>
        <p></p>
        was all quite normal. Amane snatched the fork from Mahiru's hand and held out a bite<p></p>
        <p></p>
        of cake to her in the same way she'd done for him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Turnabout is fair play, right?<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…Um." Mahiru hesitated.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Eat it," Amane insisted, his tone surprisingly forceful. Mahiru looked even more<p></p>
        <p></p>
        confused. Perhaps knowing that she'd started this, she decided to play along and<p></p>
        <p></p>
        timidly took a quick bite. The action reminded Amane of a small bird nipping at<p></p>
        <p></p>
        something.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Amane stared at Mahiru as she chewed, and gradually, a change came over her. At first,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        she'd just looked entirely bewildered, but as her mouth moved, a slight redness spread<p></p>
        <p></p>
        across Mahiru's face. By the time she swallowed the cake, there was no hiding her<p></p>
        <p></p>
        obvious embarrassment. Mahiru's usually milk-white cheeks now resembled apples,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        and her eyes were shimmering, slightly blurred with tears.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "So what do you think?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I-it's d-delicious…"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Not that. What do you think about being fed?"<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Surely Mahiru understood now how Amane had felt earlier, and her eyes shifted down<p></p>
        <p></p>
        to look at the floor while she trembled faintly.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "…I feel very much like running away."<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "I bet you do. That's exactly the sort of thing that might give people the wrong idea,<p></p>
        <p></p>
        you know. Save it for your female friends, okay?" Amane turned away sharply to<p></p>
        <p></p>
        emphasize his point.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        "Okay," Mahiru replied with a voice that was barely above a whisper.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        She'd probably only fed Amane so easily because she trusted him. Mahiru hadn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        meant any harm by it, of course, but it was still troublesome.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        A stubborn sweetness still clung to the inside of Amane's mouth.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Guess someone feeling too safe around you can be its own kind of problem.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        In the end, Mahiru curled up into a ball next to Amane, looking slightly embarrassed<p></p>
        <p></p>
        as she let a small sigh escape.<p></p>
        <p></p>

        12 Cooking Classes with the Angel<p></p>
        Amane usually bought something to eat for lunch at school, but on days off, that wasn't<p></p>
        <p></p>
        possible. He and Mahiru each had their own errands to take care of, so it was<p></p>
        <p></p>
        impossible to eat both lunch and dinner together. Even if it had been doable, Amane<p></p>
        <p></p>
        would've felt supremely guilty asking Mahiru to make and eat two meals with him.<p></p>
        <p></p>
        Usually, Amane only needed to handle his weekend lunches himself, but if he made too<p></p>
