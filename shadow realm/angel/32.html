        <p></p>words, if you ask me why I started liking Amane. But he
        <p></p>accepts me for everything that I am, and he respects and
        <p></p>cherishes me, so I guess that's it." Her voice was calm, with
        <p></p>an affectionate tone.
        <p></p>"As I've said before, Amane may seem cold at first glance,
        <p></p>but on the inside, he's gentle, kind, and chivalrous. He's
        <p></p>supported me through tough times and doesn't give easy,
        <p></p>superficial encouragement. He sees me for who I am and has
        <p></p>shown me who he is through his actions. He's also accepted
        <p></p>all of my flaws. On top of that, he has encouraged me and
        <p></p>helped me until I could stand on my own. It would be
        <p></p>stranger if I hadn't fallen for someone like that… It was
        <p></p>enough to convince me that he's the only one for me."
        <p></p>Amane felt his face burning up as he realized Mahiru was
        <p></p>saying that she had been attracted to him since that time
        <p></p>over spring break, when he had seen her with her mother.
        <p></p>He had been meaning to ask her when exactly she had
        <p></p>first started liking him, and what she liked about him, but he
        <p></p>had never expected to hear the answer this way, in public,
        <p></p>lovingly detailed and delivered with a joyful yet bashful look
        <p></p>on her face.
        <p></p>Amane was filled with the urge to bolt from the room.
        <p></p>"Amane is the person who accepts me, cares for me,
        <p></p>respects me, and looks out for me," Mahiru continued. "He's
        <p></p>shy and a little blunt but always kind. The more I get to
        <p></p>know him, the more I like him."
        <p></p>"M-Mahiru, please stop there."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Of course, it would be a lie to say he doesn't have any bad
        <p></p>points," she added. "He's pretty hopeless when it comes to
        <p></p>taking care of himself, and he suffers from a dire lack of
        <p></p>confidence… But recently he's been working hard and
        <p></p>getting better, which is just great, in my opinion, and it's
        <p></p>really cute that he thinks so highly of me and gets a little
        <p></p>intimidated— Mmph!"
        <p></p>"…Please, have mercy!"
        <p></p>Amane was sure he would die of shame if she told them
        <p></p>anything more, so in the middle of Mahiru's sentence, he
        <p></p>interrupted her by clamping one hand over her mouth. But it
        <p></p>was already too late, and the embarrassment was agonizing.
        <p></p>But Amane was not the only one with a red face.
        <p></p>The other students surrounding them, who had all
        <p></p>listened to Mahiru's rambling about her sweetheart, were
        <p></p>also slightly flushed. Everyone was looking around as if they
        <p></p>couldn't stand to be there any longer.
        <p></p>"Why would you say stuff like that?"
        <p></p>"I thought I should use the opportunity to explain how
        <p></p>much I like you," Mahiru answered, "and to call attention to
        <p></p>your good points, to keep you and the other boys from
        <p></p>fighting."
        <p></p>"Well, I don't think it was such a good idea… Plus, a lot of
        <p></p>the stuff you said was really embarrassing!"
        <p></p>"What part?"
        <p></p>"…The last bit."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Well, it's the truth. Of course, those things about you are
        <p></p>great, too. I find your flaws just as charming."
        <p></p>"Stop it. Even if that's true, I seriously won't last if you do
        <p></p>that again."
        <p></p>Amane bit his lip. It was a complicated feeling, listening
        <p></p>to his girlfriend list his shortcomings in front of everybody.
        <p></p>From beside him came a reserved little giggle.
        <p></p>"You don't get to laugh; you're just as new at this as I am,"
        <p></p>Amane grumbled in a voice only Mahiru could hear, and
        <p></p>then he turned away. When he did, Mahiru punched his arm
        <p></p>very gently, so she seemed to have some self-awareness.
        <p></p>As Amane was trying to regain his composure after her
        <p></p>adorable attack, a soft clapping echoed through the
        <p></p>classroom. Chitose was standing there staring at them,
        <p></p>hands held together.
        <p></p>"Okay, okay, flirting time is over! The damage is done…
        <p></p>Unless there's a challenger among you gentlemen who
        <p></p>thinks he can force his way between these two deeply
        <p></p>infatuated lovers?"
        <p></p>"Impossible."
        <p></p>"I don't think any of us could win."
        <p></p>"You mean we'd get our asses kicked."
        <p></p>The other boys shook their heads despondently at
        <p></p>Chitose's challenge.
        <p></p>Amane, too, hung his head, defeated.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>He'd never expected Mahiru to say so much—and in front
        <p></p>of everyone, as well. His heart could barely take it. When he
        <p></p>looked over at her, wishing he could just disappear from the
        <p></p>shame, he saw Mahiru was wearing a smile that was full of
        <p></p>confidence and joy.
        <p></p>"Oh, Shiina…" One of the girls in their class, who had
        <p></p>been watching the whole scene unfurl from the background,
        <p></p>stepped forward to address Mahiru. "How do I put this…?
        <p></p>When you're with someone you really care about, you're just
        <p></p>like any other ordinary girl, huh?"
        <p></p>Mahiru's eyes widened at first, then she gave a smile that
        <p></p>was innocent and impish.
        <p></p>"I mean, I am just a normal girl," she asserted without
        <p></p>hesitation, before looking coyly over at Amane again. He
        <p></p>wondered whether this might actually make her more
        <p></p>popular…then ruffled her hair to hide his embarrassment.
        <p></p>The rest of the day felt extremely long, probably because
        <p></p>people kept staring at them.
        <p></p>Although they had deliberately made a display of
        <p></p>themselves, it was nevertheless mentally exhausting to be
        <p></p>the focus of so much attention, some of which was certainly
        <p></p>unfriendly.
        <p></p>By the time the day's lessons finally ended, Amane felt
        <p></p>drained.
        <p></p>"Mahiru, let's go home," he called to her. She was also
        <p></p>getting ready to head out.
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru were, as always, part of the "go-home
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>club." Apparently, Mahiru didn't participate in clubs because
        <p></p>she worried there would be problems if she joined. She
        <p></p>thought her presence might be too much of a distraction.
        <p></p>She'd made that choice precisely because she was aware of
        <p></p>her effect on people, but Amane was a little sad that she felt
        <p></p>compelled to hold back for such a reason.
        <p></p>Mahiru herself didn't seem bothered by it. She had even
        <p></p>pointed out that not being in a club had allowed her to meet
        <p></p>Amane in the first place, which had only embarrassed him
        <p></p>more.
        <p></p>Mahiru finished gathering up her things and gave Amane
        <p></p>a soft smile. "Okay, sorry for making you wait."
        <p></p>Amane felt his expression relax as well. Before, they had
        <p></p>always had to go home separately, but now he was happy
        <p></p>they could walk back side by side.
        <p></p>"We're headed out; is that okay?"
        <p></p>As he picked up Mahiru's bag from where she'd set it on
        <p></p>his desk, Amane spoke to Itsuki, who was beside him. Yuuta
        <p></p>had club activities to attend, so he had already disappeared
        <p></p>from the classroom.
        <p></p>"Mm, well, I would feel bad for butting in on the
        <p></p>newlyweds, so you two go on and flirt as much as you like on
        <p></p>your way back home," Itsuki answered.
        <p></p>"We are not newlyweds, dumbass."
        <p></p>"Yeah, I know, you're more like an old married couple."
        <p></p>"That's not what I mean."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane glared at his friend for talking nonsense, but Itsuki
        <p></p>didn't seem to pay him any mind. Instead, he cheerfully
        <p></p>answered Amane's sharp look with his usual flippant grin.
        <p></p>"No matter how you slice it, that's just how you seem.
        <p></p>Don't you think so, too, Chi?"
        <p></p>"Totally!" Chitose agreed.
        <p></p>"You're so nosy! Or is that the duty of the cringe couple?"
        <p></p>"Oh, big words! We're the original, so I'm crowning you
        <p></p>two 'cringe couple the second.'"
        <p></p>"Unbelievable…"
        <p></p>"Now, now, Amane, calm down."
        <p></p>Amane wanted to flick Itsuki right in the forehead, but
        <p></p>Mahiru stepped in to mediate, so he gave up on the idea.
        <p></p>"And you, Mr. Akazawa, please don't tease Amane so
        <p></p>much."
        <p></p>"Mahiru…"
        <p></p>"Amane can't be honest about his feelings, so when you
        <p></p>tease him, he gets sulky. So please, go easy on him, okay?"
        <p></p>"Mahiru, not you, too?"
        <p></p>"I'm only kidding…"
        <p></p>Amane had conflicting feelings about Mahiru joining in
        <p></p>on everyone's teasing. But seeing her at school with a
        <p></p>genuine, happy smile, he couldn't bring himself to put a stop
        <p></p>to it.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>She had always worn the beautiful, angelic, fake smile that
        <p></p>everyone admired, with her true one hidden behind it. There
        <p></p>was no way Amane was going to condemn the comfortable,
        <p></p>lively demeanor that she had now.
        <p></p>That said, he knew he wouldn't be satisfied until he got
        <p></p>her back for the teasing, so he intended to make her pay
        <p></p>once they arrived home.
        <p></p>"Come on, Amane, let's head back." Mahiru seemed to
        <p></p>have sensed something and hurriedly urged him to leave, so
        <p></p>Amane smiled and took her hand.
        <p></p>"Okay."
        <p></p>"One reason I'm glad we made our relationship public is
        <p></p>that we can go shopping together now," Mahiru said softly as
        <p></p>they were picking out ingredients for that evening's meal in
        <p></p>the supermarket.
        <p></p>The supermarket wasn't really a place where high school
        <p></p>couples went together, and they hadn't planned for it to be a
        <p></p>date, but they needed to prepare for dinner, so the two of
        <p></p>them stopped by.
        <p></p>"Yeah, I guess we couldn't really go together before, huh?"
        <p></p>"Right. But from now on, we can go shopping and do
        <p></p>other things together openly."
        <p></p>"Yeah, we can. And if you like, we can even talk about the
        <p></p>menu."
        <p></p>"Yes."
        <p></p>Generally, they decided on the menu ahead of time, but
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>going forward, if there was something Amane suddenly
        <p></p>wanted to eat, he could point it out in the store.
        <p></p>Originally, they had planned to make a Japanese-style
        <p></p>meal that night, but Amane had seen the lunch of the day at
        <p></p>the school cafeteria and told Mahiru that he wanted to have
        <p></p>fried chicken instead. So she was going to grant his wish.
        <p></p>She placed a carefully selected package of chicken thighs
        <p></p>into the basket that Amane was holding and said, "We've
        <p></p>had meat for the last few meals, so a seafood dish would be
        <p></p>nice for tomorrow, don't you think?" Mahiru was already
        <p></p>planning the next night's dinner as well. "What do you think,
        <p></p>Amane?"
        <p></p>"Well, anything is fine… But that's not super helpful,
        <p></p>yeah? Let's see, I think I'd like to eat some mackerel."
        <p></p>"It's in season now, so that should be perfect. All right, I'll
        <p></p>make roasted spicy mackerel. You don't like too much
        <p></p>vinegar, right?"
        <p></p>"Mm-hmm."
        <p></p>Amane smiled and remarked on how well she knew him,
        <p></p>and Mahiru responded bashfully, "Well, I have been making
        <p></p>you dinner for more than half a year."
        <p></p>Amane had indeed been eating with Mahiru for more than
        <p></p>six months, and she'd had plenty of time to get to know his
        <p></p>preferences. The better part of the year had gone by since
        <p></p>they had started spending time together, and Amane felt
        <p></p>moved reminiscing about it.
        <p></p>"…It's amazing to think that we've been hanging out for
        <p></p>half a year," he said.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"It certainly seemed like a long time from my perspective,
        <p></p>you know? Since you were so obtuse and pretended not to
        <p></p>see the truth, even after you noticed how I felt," Mahiru
        <p></p>answered.
        <p></p>"Uh… I said I was sorry."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh, I didn't mean to pick on you… Now that I know
        <p></p>how you really feel, it's all right."
        <p></p>Amane felt a little uncomfortable as Mahiru gave him an
        <p></p>impish smile. But he knew that it was his own fault for
        <p></p>failing to make a move in the first place. There was nothing
        <p></p>to do but admit his shortcomings.
        <p></p>"Well, from now on, I'll make sure to express my love
        <p></p>more openly."
        <p></p>"Thank you very much. I'll do the same."
        <p></p>"…Although if you do it too much, things will get difficult
        <p></p>for me, so please do it in moderation."
        <p></p>"What do you mean by difficult?"
        <p></p>"…Please don't bring out my inner animal."
        <p></p>If Mahiru continued to spoil Amane, his brain might cease
        <p></p>to function, so he didn't want her to take it too far.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to take his meaning. He could practically
        <p></p>see the blood rushing to her face as she answered him in a
        <p></p>docile voice, "I-I'll be careful…"
        <p></p>Amane nodded, feeling his own face turning red. "Yeah."

        <p></p>"Say, Itsuki?"
        <p></p>"What is it, my friend?"
        <p></p>"…Would you say Mahiru has somehow gotten even more
        <p></p>popular since we started dating?"
        <p></p>Amane muttered these words as he watched his girlfriend
        <p></p>cheerfully talk with a cluster of classmates who had
        <p></p>surrounded her in their classroom.
        <p></p>"Sure would," Itsuki affirmed.
        <p></p>Several days had passed since Amane and Mahiru had
        <p></p>started dating, and Mahiru's popularity showed no signs of
        <p></p>declining. It actually seemed to be increasing.
        <p></p>It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say Mahiru had always
        <p></p>been the most popular person in their class, but now there
        <p></p>were even more people hovering around her.
        <p></p>Amane was grateful that there seemed to be more girls
        <p></p>than boys in the crowd, although he did have mixed feelings
        <p></p>about the passionate looks the boys were giving her.
        <p></p>"Well, it's pretty obvious why she's more popular than
        <p></p>ever," Itsuki added.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"And why is that?"
        <p></p>"How do I put this…? Up to now, it was like she existed on
        <p></p>the other side of a glass showcase, but now she seems more
        <p></p>approachable somehow. I think it's because their idol, the
        <p></p>unattainable Miss Shiina, has shown that she's actually just
        <p></p>an ordinary girl by being with a guy like you, Amane."
        <p></p>Sure enough, the nature of Mahiru's smile had changed
        <p></p>since she started dating Amane. Of course, she still had her
        <p></p>angelic smile, but she had started to show her true face as
        <p></p>well; she was frequently showing the innocent face of a girl
        <p></p>her age.
        <p></p>It was happening gradually, but she was behaving less like
        <p></p>the angel and showing more of her real self. That made
        <p></p>Amane happy to see, but at the same time, he felt a little bit
        <p></p>uneasy about having to share another secret.
        <p></p>He had asked her to do it, to show everyone that she was
        <p></p>an ordinary girl, but now that it was happening, he felt
        <p></p>depressed to see it and hated himself for his own
        <p></p>inconsistency.
        <p></p>"How can I explain it? I really feel conflicted," Amane
        <p></p>said, "seeing her true self in public when it used to be
        <p></p>something private and special. I know I ought to be happy
        <p></p>about it, but somehow, I feel depressed. I think I'm being
        <p></p>petty, even for me."
        <p></p>"That's your possessiveness materializing… But look, it's
        <p></p>not like the face she has on now is everything, right? I'm
        <p></p>sure she has plenty of faces that she only shows to you."
        <p></p>"Yeah, I guess."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>The look of embarrassment mixed with happiness that
        <p></p>she made when he touched her, the discontented expression
        <p></p>with both cheeks puffed out like little balloons when she was
        <p></p>pouting, the soft, sweet smile she put on whenever he
        <p></p>pampered her, like a sponge that had soaked up a load of
        <p></p>honey—all these were faces she showed only to Amane.
        <p></p>"Besides, you're the one who changed her. That smile
        <p></p>exists because of you, so don't lose your nerve now. 'Look at
        <p></p>how cute my Mahiru is!'—that's how you should be acting."
        <p></p>"…I can't exactly call her 'my Mahiru,' but I'll try not to get
        <p></p>jealous."
        <p></p>"What do you mean, you can't say that she's yours? After
        <p></p>flirting like that in front of everyone?"
        <p></p>"Well, that was… We didn't do it on purpose."
        <p></p>"It would have been pretty bold if you had! And even if it
        <p></p>wasn't on purpose, it still shows just how much you like each
        <p></p>other. Enough to make waves. Look around you, man!"
        <p></p>Itsuki poked Amane in the forehead, and Amane pressed his
        <p></p>lips together into a tight line.
        <p></p>Recently, for some reason, some of their classmates had
        <p></p>taken to blushing or looking around restlessly whenever
        <p></p>Amane and Mahiru were nearby. Even when they weren't
        <p></p>touching very much or talking about anything important,
        <p></p>their presence made them blush. Amane did not understand.
        <p></p>He did receive a fair number of looks of jealousy, but
        <p></p>more and more, the stares he was getting were lukewarm.
        <p></p>According to one male classmate, who had previously
        <p></p>turned on him in jealousy, the fact that he and Mahiru were
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>so close was making other people feel hopeless.
        <p></p>It was embarrassing to hear, even from outsiders, that
        <p></p>Mahiru only had eyes for him, but it also made him a little
        <p></p>happy.
        <p></p>"Well, I guess she's also showing off that she's her own
        <p></p>person and not obsessed with you."
        <p></p>"I'm not worth obsessing over. I don't stand out as much
        <p></p>as Mahiru, and I don't want people to pay attention to me. I
        <p></p>don't know what to do when that happens."
        <p></p>"…Well, you might not stand out, but you're still a solid
        <p></p>guy. I don't need to talk about your academics, and you are a
        <p></p>little sarcastic, but fundamentally, you're a gentleman and
        <p></p>the kind of honest guy who doesn't turn his back on people.
        <p></p>From the perspective of a girl who's looking for some
        <p></p>stability, I bet you look like a good catch."
        <p></p>"It's kinda…weird hearing you talk about me like that…"
        <p></p>"Okay, that's a fifty-point penalty for bad-mouthing me.
        <p></p>Now then, you never say what you're thinking, so people
        <p></p>assume you're unsociable, but that's just perception, and
        <p></p>personality-wise, you are surprisingly straightforward."
        <p></p>"A sure sign that I'm screwed up."
        <p></p>Even though Amane had been sulking less and less, he
        <p></p>was still convinced that he had a bad personality.
        <p></p>He felt like the compliments about being sincere and a
        <p></p>good person would be better directed toward a
        <p></p>straightforward, agreeable young man like Yuuta, rather
        <p></p>than a guy like himself, who had a warped view of the world.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"In my opinion, you're super easy to read and have an
        <p></p>honest personality. Chi says the same thing, that you're easy
        <p></p>to understand."
        <p></p>"You guys—"
        <p></p>"You go on and on about being screwed up or whatever,
        <p></p>but you're a straight shooter and a considerate guy, I think.
        <p></p>You're a little sarcastic, though."
        <p></p>"Oh, I'm so sorry."
        <p></p>Amane turned away peevishly, and Itsuki laughed out
        <p></p>loud and slapped his shoulder. Amane jabbed him back
        <p></p>gently with his elbow and mumbled quietly, "Thanks, man."
        <p></p>"You've gotten easier to talk to since you started dating
        <p></p>Shiina, Fujimiya."
        <p></p>It seemed Mahiru wasn't the only one experiencing a
        <p></p>change in her social life. Amane's environment was
        <p></p>changing, too.
        <p></p>Before getting together with Mahiru, Amane had rarely
        <p></p>spoken to anyone other than his closest friends. Besides
        <p></p>simple greetings or when it was required for schoolwork, not
        <p></p>many people had ever gone out of their way to speak to him,
        <p></p>either. But since he and Mahiru had started dating, people
        <p></p>had begun to speak to him more frequently.
        <p></p>"…I have?"
        <p></p>Amane was helping out a female classmate who had
        <p></p>gotten stuck with cleaning the classroom because the boy
        <p></p>who was originally supposed to do it was absent. She was
        <p></p>worried about being late to her part-time job.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>He wasn't sure how to reply to her sudden assertion, so he
        <p></p>shrugged in response.
        <p></p>Mahiru had meant to help as well, but another girl had
        <p></p>approached her to ask for some advice, and they were
        <p></p>chatting in a corner of the classroom.
        <p></p>Mahiru was very caring that way, as she had always been,
        <p></p>and as her boyfriend, he found it very charming, but he also
        <p></p>thought it looked like a difficult thing to do.
        <p></p>As she smoothly wrote down the day's events in the class
        <p></p>log, the girl on duty for the day glanced over at Amane's face
        <p></p>while he finished tidying up the classroom and cleaning the
        <p></p>blackboard, and she smiled.
        <p></p>"You've really changed, you know? Actually, before you
        <p></p>had your makeover, you were difficult to approach. You gave
        <p></p>off an aura that said 'Don't talk to me.' I wondered if you
        <p></p>might have some kind of social anxiety."
        <p></p>"Sorry about that."
        <p></p>"Ah-ha-ha, I don't know what to do with that apology. It's
        <p></p>just part of your personality, so I wasn't trying to criticize
        <p></p>you, all right? I just figured that you're the type to keep your
        <p></p>friend circle small but tight-knit. That's why I thought it was
        <p></p>interesting you got along with Kadowaki. And now you've
        <p></p>gone through an image change, and a few days have passed.
        <p></p>You're the same guy you've always been, but I can tell you're
        <p></p>just starting to become more social."
        <p></p>"…You're very observant, Kido."
        <p></p>"Well, it's just one of my hobbies, so…"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane was surprised that she had been paying quite a bit
        <p></p>of attention to him. He didn't know her that well, though she
        <p></p>seemed a lot like Chitose, a person who was often at the
        <p></p>center of things, lifting the mood with her bright smile. She
        <p></p>was popular in a different way from Mahiru—and that
        <p></p>summed up what he knew about this girl, Ayaka Kido.
        <p></p>Amane had never interacted with her before, so his
        <p></p>impressions of her were based purely on observation, but
        <p></p>apparently she had been watching him carefully, even
        <p></p>though she had never directly talked with him until now.
        <p></p>"…Well, you noticed an awful lot, even though I kept
        <p></p>myself shut away."
        <p></p>"For Shiina's sake?"
        <p></p>"No, not for her sake, but for my own."
        <p></p>Mahiru had never wished for him to change, and he
        <p></p>wasn't going to claim she was responsible for his new
        <p></p>behavior. The desire to change had come from Amane
        <p></p>himself.
        <p></p>"It was thanks to Mahiru that I decided to change, but it
        <p></p>wasn't for her," he explained. "I wanted to be by her side, so
        <p></p>I stopped closing myself off; that's all. I did everything for
        <p></p>my own sake."
        <p></p>Amane was confident that Mahiru would have liked him
        <p></p>just the same even before he plucked up the courage to take
        <p></p>these steps, but even so, he wanted to feel proud that he had
        <p></p>made the decision to change for himself.
        <p></p>He felt that he wanted to put in the effort to better himself
        <p></p>so he would be suitable enough to walk by Mahiru's side. To
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>put it into words, it was nothing more than his own selfsatisfaction. It was Amane's decision; it had not
        been
        <p></p>something Mahiru had asked for. Amane asserted he had
        <p></p>done it for himself.
        <p></p>Ayaka, who looked to have finished writing her log entry,
        <p></p>was smiling happily. "Shiina sure is lucky, huh?"
        <p></p>"…How did we get on this topic?"
        <p></p>"Oh-hoh-hoh, it's just what we were talking about!"
        <p></p>Amane felt like his cheek was about to start twitching.
        <p></p>Ayaka was grinning cheerfully, but there wasn't so much as a
        <p></p>hint of teasing in her eyes, so he couldn't get mad at her.
        <p></p>"Well, just from that, I can tell you're devoted, mister. If
        <p></p>you didn't care for her, you wouldn't try to change. I think
        <p></p>it's amazing you would work so hard for the person you
        <p></p>love… Oh, you don't like it worded that way, do you? That
        <p></p>you would work hard to match her. That's love, real love."
        <p></p>"…It's not a bad thing…right?"
        <p></p>"Oh no, it's good, it's good! I'm sure Shiina can also tell
        <p></p>that you care about her a lot. Actually, she's looking over
        <p></p>here right now."
        <p></p>When Amane glanced at the corner of the classroom at
        <p></p>Ayaka's urging, he saw Mahiru waiting there quietly, alone,
        <p></p>apparently finished with her conversation. She was wearing
        <p></p>a slightly anxious expression, probably because he was
        <p></p>having a heartfelt talk with another girl.
        <p></p>"She's looking right at you, huh?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"She sure is."
        <p></p>"Make sure she doesn't misunderstand this, okay? I've got
        <p></p>my own boyfriend, so I wasn't trying to make her jealous or
        <p></p>anything."
        <p></p>Ayaka laughed, and at the same moment, almost as if it
        <p></p>had been timed, a guy's voice called for her from outside the
        <p></p>classroom.
        <p></p>"Ayaka, you done yet? You'll be late for work."
        <p></p>"Sou? Wait up, I'll just go turn this in!"
        <p></p>That reminded Amane that she had a part-time job to
        <p></p>rush to, yet she hadn't seemed to be in too much of a hurry.
        <p></p>Not enough to prevent her from hanging around having a
        <p></p>leisurely chat with the boy anyway.
        <p></p>He made eye contact with Ayaka, and she responded with
        <p></p>a playful wink.
        <p></p>"Thanks for helping me out, Fujimiya. Um, as thanks…
        <p></p>this is all I have, sorry. See ya!"
        <p></p>In one very swift motion, Ayaka pulled something out of
        <p></p>her bag, placed it in the palm of Amane's hand, turned, and
        <p></p>trotted out of the classroom.
        <p></p>Thinking that the girl was like a passing storm, Amane
        <p></p>looked down at the thing she'd handed him and saw it was a
        <p></p>chocolate bar packed with protein puffs—the kind that Yuuta
        <p></p>had suggested he ought to eat after working out.
        <p></p>"She didn't need to thank me… And why did she choose
        <p></p>this?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Amane stared at the door that Ayaka had left through,
        <p></p>wondering why she'd been carrying the bar around in the
        <p></p>first place, and whether by offering it to him she'd meant to
        <p></p>say that he was too thin and needed to put on more muscle.
        <p></p>Meanwhile, Mahiru approached him.
        <p></p>She didn't look upset, exactly, but she was making an
        <p></p>expression like she had something to say.
        <p></p>"…You look like you really want to say something."
        <p></p>"D-don't take this to mean I don't trust you, okay? But you
        <p></p>looked like you were enjoying your conversation, so I was
        <p></p>wondering what you were talking about…"
        <p></p>As one might expect, Mahiru seemed to be uneasy about
        <p></p>her boyfriend talking to another girl.
        <p></p>Amane never had the intention of making Mahiru feel
        <p></p>that way and had figured she would have recognized that it
        <p></p>was just small talk even from the other side of the room, but
        <p></p>if she had been worried about it, he thought he ought to
        <p></p>apologize.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Sorry for worrying you. She was just telling me how
        <p></p>much I've changed. Even from Kido's perspective, I must
        <p></p>look really different."
        <p></p>Naturally, Amane was embarrassed to tell her that he and
        <p></p>Kido had discussed matters regarding love, so he
        <p></p>intentionally omitted that from his explanation, but he was
        <p></p>able to tell Mahiru the main thrust of their conversation.
        <p></p>He stroked her hair as he spoke slowly, and she seemed to
        <p></p>calm down a little. Her troubled frown slowly softened into a
        <p></p>smile. Recently, Amane had figured out that Mahiru liked it
        <p></p>when they touched.
        <p></p>"Well, she's right. When it comes to appearance, you've
        <p></p>turned into a handsome young man. It's a very clear
        <p></p>difference from before."
        <p></p>"I did come off as gloomy, so I guess it's a big difference."
        <p></p>"Sure, because the previous Amane was a quiet guy with
        <p></p>an almost impenetrable reserve. Your old look made you
        <p></p>seem completely unapproachable… But if she said you've
        <p></p>changed, she probably meant something personality-wise,
        <p></p>huh?"
        <p></p>"Well, she said I was easier to talk to now."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh. That's just because you've never been very
        <p></p>assertive. You never have trouble when someone else starts
        <p></p>the conversation. So when you announced that you were
        <p></p>dating me, it was a signal for everyone to come talk to you.
        <p></p>And now that you've talked with others more, they've
        <p></p>realized you're easy to get along with. That's what I think, at
        <p></p>least. Also, you've mellowed out, compared to before."
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>Mahiru poked at Amane's cheek with her fingertip, getting
        <p></p>back at him for tussling her hair. It tickled, and he felt
        <p></p>humiliated by it, so he grabbed her hand and pushed it away
        <p></p>from his face.
        <p></p>Instead, he squeezed her hand, then entwined his fingers
        <p></p>with hers and tapped the tips of his fingers against the back
        <p></p>of her hand, satisfying her craving for physical contact.
        <p></p>Mahiru, who was wearing a more comfortable smile than
        <p></p>before, leaned in and whispered, "Amane, you've also been
        <p></p>smiling more lately."
        <p></p>In his embarrassment, Amane averted his gaze from
        <p></p>Mahiru.
        <p></p>"…I think that changed because I've been spending time
        <p></p>with you. Also, if you're going to say that, I should mention
        <p></p>that you seem easier to talk to than before, too."
        <p></p>"If that's true, it's because I've been spending time with
        <p></p>you."
        <p></p>"…Oh really, now?"
        <p></p>"That's right."
        <p></p>He could tell she was smiling happily without even
        <p></p>looking at her. Keeping his face turned away, Amane
        <p></p>kneaded her hand energetically, as if in payback—and to
        <p></p>distract from his obvious bashfulness.

        <p></p>Chapter 58: Something that Can’t Be Concealed
        <p></p>By late June, the rainy season was at its peak, and there
        <p></p>was a string of days when the weather alternated between
        <p></p>clear and stormy.
        <p></p>Droplets of rain fell steadily from a gray and gloomy sky,
        <p></p>and the air felt thick and dismal. Everyone was feeling
        <p></p>cooped up, probably because the color of the sky was even
        <p></p>darker than it had been before.
        <p></p>"…Yuck, it's so muggy!"
        <p></p>"Well, it is the rainy season."
        <p></p>It was only to be expected that the school was also filled
        <p></p>with a listless atmosphere. All the members of the sports
        <p></p>clubs were sopping wet from practicing outside, which
        <p></p>added to the dreariness.
        <p></p>Even Chitose, who loved to run around energetically
        <p></p>despite not being a member of any sports club, seemed to
        <p></p>have met her match and had collapsed limply down in her
        <p></p>seat, where she lay flopped across her desk. Amane hadn't
        <p></p>seen her so drained since last year's rainy season. Even her
        <p></p>hairstyle was different.
        <p></p>Chitose usually wore her hair down, but on that day, she
        <p></p>had it tied into two frizzy bunches—wild from the humidity
        <p></p>—with one behind each ear. Despite her efforts to control it,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>from time to time, a stray lock would escape from the
        <p></p>confines of its hair band. There was no doubt that she had
        <p></p>struggled considerably to tie it in the first place.
        <p></p>"You seem to be doing just fine, Amane."
        <p></p>"Hmm, well, I do usually prefer a quieter atmosphere. I
        <p></p>could do without the humidity, though."
        <p></p>"Good for you. I can't stand it when it's like this. It makes
        <p></p>me want to run around screaming."
        <p></p>"The ground is in bad shape, so you'll have to wait until
        <p></p>the weather clears up to go wild. If you fell, you'd hurt
        <p></p>yourself and your clothes would get covered in mud."
        <p></p>"It would never come out in the wash… I'll sit tight, but
        <p></p>man…"
        <p></p>Even her voice seemed dulled by the rainy weather.
        <p></p>Considering Chitose was so terribly weary, Amane
        <p></p>wondered how Mahiru was doing. He could see her chatting
        <p></p>with a group of girls, wearing a gentle smile. Somehow, her
        <p></p>expression looked slightly more energetic than usual.
        <p></p>Mahiru didn't seem to notice that Amane was watching her,
        <p></p>and she was enjoying her conversation.
        <p></p>Amane was staring at Mahiru, thinking about how he was
        <p></p>going to spend a lot of time with her when they got home.
        <p></p>Makoto noticed where he was looking and asked, "What,
        <p></p>Fujimiya, you jealous of the girls?"
        <p></p>Makoto always observed his surroundings closely, so it
        <p></p>was no surprise that he had noticed where Amane was
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>looking, but Amane had to smile because the reason his
        <p></p>friend imagined was completely wrong.
        <p></p>"No, I'm not petty enough to be jealous of the girls. It's
        <p></p>just, her hair is different today, so it gives her a new look,
        <p></p>and I was admiring it."
        <p></p>Amane was too embarrassed to say what had actually
        <p></p>been on his mind, so he pivoted to another reason in
        <p></p>response, and Makoto responded in an understanding tone,
        <p></p>"She's got it tied up today, huh?"
        <p></p>Just like Chitose, Mahiru's hair was tied up. But Mahiru's
        <p></p>hair was longer than Chitose's and had a lot of volume, so
        <p></p>she had gathered it all into two braids that hung loosely
        <p></p>down on either side.
        <p></p>She didn't change her hairstyle often, so it had also been a
        <p></p>new look for their classmates. Amane had heard some of the
        <p></p>boys muttering that seeing the angel was like a breath of
        <p></p>fresh air in the suffocating humidity.
        <p></p>"You seem rather chipper, Makoto. I'm jealous, for more
        <p></p>than one reason," Chitose grumbled.
        <p></p>Trying desperately to control her hair, which didn't want
        <p></p>to listen to her in the humidity, Chitose looked jealously at
        <p></p>Makoto's smooth locks, which seemed entirely unbothered
        <p></p>by the damp air. She had also been bugging Amane about his
        <p></p>hair from the moment she'd first seen him that morning; she
        <p></p>seemed incredibly jealous of anyone whose hair was
        <p></p>unaffected by the humidity.
        <p></p>"I'm not exactly chipper. Just not as depressed as
        <p></p>everyone else. I still have trouble with practical stuff when
        <p></p>the rain won't let up, and I'd like the rainy season to end
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>soon. When it's this cloudy, you can't even see the stars." 5
        <p></p>"Oh right, you're in the astronomy club. I guess when it's
        <p></p>like this, seeing the stars is out of the question."
        <p></p>"I mean, we hardly ever actually go look at the stars as a
        <p></p>club. If we wanted to watch the stars at school, we would
        <p></p>have to get an adviser to accompany us, put in an application
        <p></p>to get access to the roof, and stay at school after hours. It's a
        <p></p>whole thing. As a club, we mostly do research and stuff, then
        <p></p>watch the stars on our own at home. But either way, it seems
        <p></p>like we won't be able to observe anything for a little while. It
        <p></p>sucks."
        <p></p>Makoto frowned in vexation, and Chitose nodded in
        <p></p>agreement. Mahiru seemed to have finished her
        <p></p>conversation and walked over with easy, elegant movements
        <p></p>to stand by Amane's side.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>As Amane quietly pulled out her chair and urged her to
        <p></p>sit, he summarized their conversation to the curious-looking
        <p></p>Mahiru, "We were talking about what a pain the rainy
        <p></p>season is."
        <p></p>Mahiru deftly took her seat in front of Chitose and put on
        <p></p>a sympathetic smile when she heard the words rainy season.
        <p></p>"Well, she has a particularly difficult time with it, don't
        <p></p>you, Chitose?" she said. "It's hard for you to go out and enjoy
        <p></p>yourself, and you can't even go outside to exercise, and your
        <p></p>hair also gets messed up."
        <p></p>"I was certain that Chitose would be bursting with energy
        <p></p>even during the rainy season," Makoto remarked. "But if I
        <p></p>really think back, in middle school, too, you were always
        <p></p>quiet during this time of the year, weren't you? Especially in
        <p></p>second year. It was hard to imagine you'd be as hyper as you
        <p></p>are now."
        <p></p>"Agh, I don't wanna think about middle school!"
        <p></p>Chitose hated talking about things that happened back
        <p></p>then, when she'd been a very different person. She clapped
        <p></p>both hands over her ears and turned away.
        <p></p>Makoto shrugged and said, "I mean, you can be a little
        <p></p>loud, but the way you are now seems to suit you more;
        <p></p>honestly, I think it's better." It wasn't clear whether he was
        <p></p>trying to soothe her or make her angry so she would perk up
        <p></p>again.
        <p></p>"…You trying to pick a fight with me, Makoto?"
        <p></p>"That's not what I meant to do, but…but it's true that
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>you're loud… I mean, lively."
        <p></p>"Don't bother correcting yourself, I know what you
        <p></p>meant!"
        <p></p>Chitose frowned petulantly and beat her fists on her desk.
        <p></p>But her face seemed brighter, maybe because some of her
        <p></p>energy had returned. Makoto had managed to cheer her up 1
        <p></p>in his own way.
        <p></p>In response to Chitose's huffy fit, Amane caught Mahiru's
        <p></p>eye and smiled inconspicuously.
        <p></p>Ultimately, the rain continued through to the end of the
        <p></p>school day, and the sky was the same forbidding shade when
        <p></p>it was time to go home.
        <p></p>Because of that, the well-traveled road to and from school
        <p></p>was unusually quiet, as most students were in a hurry to get
        <p></p>home.
        <p></p>As for Amane, he drew Mahiru close to him underneath
        <p></p>his large umbrella, sharing it like sweethearts do, and
        <p></p>walked along at a pace that was comfortable for her.
        <p></p>He held Mahiru's bag as always, so it wouldn't get wet.
        <p></p>Maybe because the two of them were alone, Mahiru let out a
        <p></p>slightly disheartened and exhausted-sounding sigh. Amane
        <p></p>glanced over at her.
        <p></p>She noticed his stare and took her bag back from him. "…
        <p></p>It's so humid during the rainy season that your mood gets
        <p></p>somber, too, don't you think?" Mahiru mumbled, playing
        <p></p>absently with the ends of her hair, which were sticking out at
        <p></p>random angles a little more than usual. "And it's hard to do
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>your hair. Mine gives me such trouble, and it tangles easily."
        <p></p>"It sounds like it's more difficult than usual to set it right.
        <p></p>Personally, I think the way you have it today is cute, but I'm
        <p></p>sure it's annoying to deal with."
        <p></p>Amane personally considered getting to see Mahiru style
        <p></p>her hair in lots of different ways to be a perk, but he figured
        <p></p>that, from a girl's perspective, properly arranging it was a
        <p></p>big deal. Especially for Mahiru, who cared about her
        <p></p>personal appearance more than most.
        <p></p>The way she had her hair tied at the moment looked more
        <p></p>subdued and sweeter than usual, but Mahiru herself
        <p></p>probably did not like it all that much.
        <p></p>"C-cute?" After pondering the word, Mahiru's eyes darted
        <p></p>around bashfully, and she slapped Amane's arm with her
        <p></p>fingertips in an attempt to hide her embarrassment. "…
        <p></p>Anyway, it's hard to look after my hair in the summertime,
        <p></p>you know? At the height of summer, there's the problem of
        <p></p>sunlight causing damage, so proper care is essential. In the
        <p></p>winter, it's dry, and in the summer, it's humid, and UV rays
        <p></p>can cause harm… The way I care for it changes depending on
        <p></p>the season and the weather, so it's hard to keep up with."
        <p></p>"Being a girl sounds difficult."
        <p></p>"That's why I'm jealous of your hair, Amane."
        <p></p>Amane blinked when the topic changed to him, and
        <p></p>Mahiru looked up at his hair with slight envy. That morning,
        <p></p>it had seemed like too much work to style his hair with wax,
        <p></p>so all he had done was run a comb through it like he did on
        <p></p>the weekends.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"It's nice and smooth despite the humidity. As far as
        <p></p>grooming, it doesn't demand that much, does it?"
        <p></p>"The most I do is use that shampoo from the beauty
        <p></p>salon."
        <p></p>"That's because your hair was healthy to begin with. If you
        <p></p>took really good care of it, it would be even smoother and
        <p></p>shinier."
        <p></p>"I don't really want that, but… Well, if I have the time, I'll
        <p></p>make the effort."
        <p></p>If it made it more enjoyable for Mahiru to touch his hair,
        <p></p>then he figured making time to take care of it would be
        <p></p>worth it. Not that he was unhappy with it as it was, and
        <p></p>Mahiru never seemed to have a problem with it, either, but if
        <p></p>he thought it might make her even happier, he was glad to
        <p></p>do it.
        <p></p>He looked at Mahiru's face and saw that she had a faint
        <p></p>smile—so faint that it was barely visible. The rain was
        <p></p>obviously affecting her, and there was less vigor in her
        <p></p>expression than usual.
        <p></p>Gazing at her pale cheeks, Amane let out a quiet sigh.
        <p></p>"You know, it really sucks that I can't go jogging in this
        <p></p>weather. I had a routine going, and now I feel like I might
        <p></p>revert to my old idle habits."
        <p></p>It wasn't a good idea to go for a long run while it was
        <p></p>pouring rain. The rain would cool his muscles down even if
        <p></p>he warmed up before running, and he wouldn't get a very
        <p></p>good workout.
        <p></p>And so for the time being, he was going to take a break
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>from running. To compensate, he planned to step up the
        <p></p>weight training for his legs.
        <p></p>"You say that, but haven't you been doing more weight
        <p></p>training than usual already?"
        <p></p>"That's because I don't want to backslide, now that my
        <p></p>efforts are actually starting to show."
        <p></p>"Hee-hee, you're so serious; what a good boy. Very
        <p></p>admirable."
        <p></p>Mahiru looked pleased and softly patted Amane on the
        <p></p>back. It tickled, and with the hand that wasn't holding the
        <p></p>umbrella and his bag, Amane got his revenge by doing the
        <p></p>same to Mahiru.
        <p></p>Afterward, he looked at the sky. The horizon was still
        <p></p>dark, but something about it seemed more pleasant. It was
        <p></p>probably because the rain wasn't as intense as it had been.
        <p></p>Now it seemed to be gently enveloping them.
        <p></p>Of course, the real reason he felt at ease was due to the
        <p></p>person at his side.
        <p></p>"Well, there are some downsides to this weather, but
        <p></p>walking with you in the rain like this isn't bad at all. Rainy
        <p></p>days have their own sort of charm. The color of the sky and
        <p></p>the feeling in the air is unique, and I like it. Taking a quiet
        <p></p>stroll on a day like this seems romantic, too."
        <p></p>The rainy season might be despised by girls who
        <p></p>especially cared about their appearance, but Amane liked it.
        <p></p>It was a quiet time wrapped in a gentle feeling.
        <p></p>He liked the overcast sky giving off a dull, calm light, the
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>gentle sound of rain that tickled his ears, and the faint
        <p></p>fragrance of the rain, with the hydrangeas in full, vivid
        <p></p>bloom as if to decorate the otherwise faded scenery.
        <p></p>The landscape around them wasn't simply dark and
        <p></p>hopeless. The rainy season, and the mood and environment,
        <p></p>felt comfortable to Amane.
        <p></p>Besides, he had Mahiru by his side.
        <p></p>Just by softly squeezing her hand, the world looked
        <p></p>brightly colored again. If he changed his attitude and
        <p></p>focused on Mahiru next to him, the scenery seemed more
        <p></p>peaceful and charming. Just by walking together, the world
        <p></p>looked perfectly lovely.
        <p></p>"The rain was what led to us meeting, so I like it. And I 1
        <p></p>think that walking through the rain like this with you is a
        <p></p>priceless moment."
        <p></p>This was their first rainy season together as a couple, and
        <p></p>Amane found meaning in the very act of walking side by
        <p></p>side. It felt more precious because he knew that this exact
        <p></p>moment would never come again.
        <p></p>"Besides—"
        <p></p>"Besides?"
        <p></p>"On rainy days, there are more bargain items left at the
        <p></p>supermarket. And there are fewer people out, despite the
        <p></p>sales, so it's easier to pick up good deals!"
        <p></p>As a joke, Amane added the last reason for liking the rain
        <p></p>with a smile. Mahiru looked taken aback, but gradually her
        <p></p>expression also relaxed into a gentle smile.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"Hee-hee, that's the sort of thing you learn by living alone
        <p></p>for a long time. I get it, though."
        <p></p>"That's fine; who cares? Some types of knowledge are just
        <p></p>practical to have."
        <p></p>"I'm not saying it's bad, hee-hee-hee."
        <p></p>Mahiru giggled cheerfully, before slowly settling down
        <p></p>and looking up at Amane with quiet eyes.
        <p></p>"Amane, you're someone who can live a quiet and colorful
        <p></p>life, aren't you? You see the beauty and fun in everything
        <p></p>around you."
        <p></p>"I'm not sure what you mean?"
        <p></p>"Oh, I just suddenly had the thought. It's wonderful that
        <p></p>you can find enjoyment in all sorts of things from all sorts of
        <p></p>angles," Mahiru mumbled with a hint of jealousy. She
        <p></p>sounded a little lonesome.
        <p></p>"But I think the only reason everything I see seems to be
        <p></p>so vivid is because you're by my side, Mahiru. Really, you
        <p></p>taught me to see things I had never seen before. And I hope
        <p></p>you keep teaching me, too."
        <p></p>When Amane turned to look directly into Mahiru's
        <p></p>caramel-colored eyes, he could see them waver for a
        <p></p>moment and begin to fill with tears. But they weren't tears of
        <p></p>sadness, and slowly an expression of joy appeared on her
        <p></p>face.
        <p></p>"…I've also learned all sorts of things from you, Amane.
        <p></p>And I'm looking forward to more from now on, too." 2
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"That's good to hear."
        <p></p>He had gotten Mahiru to promise to stay by his side,
        <p></p>whether she realized it or not. He hoped he could keep her to 1
        <p></p>himself for a long time.
        <p></p>Amane had no intention of giving up his spot beside her,
        <p></p>no matter the cost.
        <p></p>Still holding Mahiru's hand, he smiled, then peered into
        <p></p>her eyes again. She was wearing the most relaxed expression
        <p></p>he had seen on her all day.
        <p></p>"…Well then, let's hurry up and think of something you
        <p></p>can do to enjoy yourself on a rainy day once we get home." 1
        <p></p>"Like what?"
        <p></p>"How about we buy some small side dishes at the
        <p></p>supermarket, then watch a drama or one of the DVDs I have
        <p></p>at home, or listen to some music and take it easy? On a day
        <p></p>like this, it's best not to work too hard—and to spend time
        <p></p>relaxing. I could tell you weren't feeling too well today,
        <p></p>physically and mentally."
        <p></p>When he stared intently into her caramel-colored eyes, he
        <p></p>could see that he had hit the mark. She flinched, and her
        <p></p>eyes started darting around.
        <p></p>Actually, he had thought something was off when they
        <p></p>had walked to school together that morning and was
        <p></p>convinced once they'd reached the classroom. Mahiru was
        <p></p>not feeling well.
        <p></p>Her usual smile was lacking some of its luster, and
        <p></p>although it was hard to tell because of the dark, dismal,
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>rainy atmosphere, her complexion was worse than usual as
        <p></p>well. Moreover, her motions had been just a bit more
        <p></p>deliberate, as if she was trying to move as little as possible.
        <p></p>Whether it had to do with the weather or a feminine issue, 2
        <p></p>it was a private matter, and he couldn't ask. But it was
        <p></p>obvious that she was feeling lethargic, and she seemed like
        <p></p>she was struggling. Amane wanted to make sure she took it
        <p></p>easy for the rest of the day.
        <p></p>When he looked at Mahiru anxiously, she seemed to have
        <p></p>resigned herself and leaned her head against Amane's arm
        <p></p>as they walked.
        <p></p>"…That perceptiveness of yours is both good and bad. I
        <p></p>can't hide anything."
        <p></p>"It's because you're bad at hiding stuff. When you're not
        <p></p>feeling well, your movements and behavior change a little
        <p></p>bit."
        <p></p>"For example?"
        <p></p>"If I tell you, you'll try to hide it, so I'm not saying."
        <p></p>Amane could tell when Mahiru was smiling, or walking, or
        <p></p>even moving her hands differently, but if he told her that,
        <p></p>she would deliberately try not to do it, so he wasn't going to
        <p></p>say anything.
        <p></p>Mahiru looked dissatisfied, but there was no way Amane
        <p></p>was going to give in, so he turned down her request and
        <p></p>rubbed her hand that he was holding. Her hand felt a little
        <p></p>colder than usual, which he figured was due to the rainy
        <p></p>weather.
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"You ought to rely on me a little bit more, okay? Here,
        <p></p>let's go into that grocery store. We'll get side dishes and…
        <p></p>Well, if there's anything you want me to make, I'll make it."
        <p></p>"…Rice balls."
        <p></p>He realized she was really having a hard time when she
        <p></p>obediently answered without putting up any resistance. He
        <p></p>thought with slight remorse that he should've taken better
        <p></p>care of her.
        <p></p>But Mahiru didn't seem like she was in danger of
        <p></p>collapsing, and at school, the last thing she wanted to do was
        <p></p>seem like she was struggling. Amane was probably reading 1
        <p></p>too much into things, but still, he thought it was probably
        <p></p>best to stay close to her side.
        <p></p>Amane adjusted his grip on Mahiru's hand as she leaned
        <p></p>on him limply, and he smiled down at her. She had stopped
        <p></p>trying to keep up appearances and was wearing a listless
        <p></p>expression.
        <p></p>"I can make something a little more elaborate than that,
        <p></p>you know? You can ask me to make whatever you want."
        <p></p>"I'd like to have the rice balls that you make."
        <p></p>Amane had been sure she was holding back because he
        <p></p>wasn't a very good cook, but apparently Mahiru really was
        <p></p>happy with his rice balls. She looked up at him with
        <p></p>somewhat frail eyes.
        <p></p>"Is that okay?"
        <p></p>"Sure thing. If you want them, I'll make them. I'll make

        <p></p>Mahiru also smiled happily. "I'm expecting them to be
        <p></p>good, okay?" She seemed to be feeling more at ease, so

        <p></p>Chapter 59: What Changed After Starting to Date 2
        <p></p>"Come to think of it, Fujimiya, I know you started dating
        <p></p>Shiina after Sports Day, but has anything else about you
        <p></p>changed?"
        <p></p>The school sports grounds were unusable due to the long
        <p></p>spell of rain, so the girls were having gym indoors while the
        <p></p>boys had health class. Just as their teacher left the
        <p></p>classroom, the student sitting in front of Amane asked him
        <p></p>that question.
        <p></p>It was just a guess, but Amane figured the inquiry was
        <p></p>prompted by their teacher's warning that since Sports Day
        <p></p>was behind them, it was time to focus on their studies. As far
        <p></p>as Amane was concerned, his attitude in class was the same
        <p></p>as ever, or maybe even more serious than before, so he
        <p></p>hadn't thought those words were directed at him. But the
        <p></p>mention of Sports Day must have unconsciously reminded
        <p></p>the other boys of him.
        <p></p>The rest of the boys must have been curious, too, because
        <p></p>they all turned to face him, which gave Amane some mixed
        <p></p>feelings.
        <p></p>"Well, I've started getting ambushed like this at school,"
        <p></p>he muttered.
        <p></p>"Sorry. But other than that? How far have you two gone?"
        <p></p>『fb.com/JNovelCodex』
        <p></p>"…We've hardly done anything," Amane replied. "At most,
        <p></p>we've started walking home together and stuff."
        <p></p>About two weeks had passed since Amane and Mahiru
        <p></p>had started dating, but nothing had really changed. After all,
        <p></p>they had plenty of physical contact before making it official,
        <p></p>and Mahiru was still coming over to his apartment like
        <p></p>always.
        <p></p>If he had to name something, it would be that he had been
        <p></p>trying to make more deliberate physical contact, but as far as
        <p></p>their daily lives were concerned, things were still the same.
        <p></p>"No way!"
        <p></p>"Why would I need to lie about that?"
        <p></p>"Well, I mean, come on…"
        <p></p>"Look—"
        <p></p>"Shiina's fallen so hard for you, so, like, I thought you'd be
        <p></p>fooling around more or something."
        <p></p>"Fooling around…? Not really; stuff like that is—"
        <p></p>"Amane! You're such a prude. We can't count on you for
        <p></p>any juicy stories." Itsuki had apparently overheard the
        <p></p>conversation from nearby. "You know, any normal couple
        <p></p>would be fooling around… You two are unbelievable!" he
        <p></p>said, exasperated.
        <p></p>Amane stared daggers at his friend, but Itsuki just
        <p></p>laughed, not at all bothered.
