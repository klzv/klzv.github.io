        <hr class="half">
        <p></p>On the other side of the finish line, Chitose, the judge, was watching them with a grin.
        <p></p>I'll remember that later.
        <p></p>The words on the scavenger hunt slips were in Chitose's handwriting, so she had
        <p></p>probably planted a certain number of them. Amane didn't know what exactly Mahiru
        <p></p>had drawn, but since she said she specifically needed him, he was sure she had gotten
        <p></p>something nonnegotiable.
        <p></p>"Uhh… what's your item, anyway?" Amane asked.
        <p></p>"It's a secret," she replied. Even though their papers were going to be read aloud after
        <p></p>they got to the goal, Mahiru wasn't going to tell him what she was looking for.
        <p></p>So Amane sighed, and they headed toward the finish line.
        <p></p>"You're my item, too, so let's hurry."
        <p></p>"…Then I should ask you, what is your item, Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"It's a secret."
        <p></p>Mahiru smiled slightly when he answered in the same way.
        <p></p>"I see, then I'm looking forward to finding out after we reach the goal," Mahiru
        <p></p>whispered, and took Amane's hand.
        <p></p>Seemingly unbothered by the noise all around them, Mahiru headed for the goal with
        <p></p>Amane in tow.
        <p></p>Amane felt a stomachache coming on, but when he saw how cheerful Mahiru was,
        <p></p>there was nothing he could do about it—he was but a coward who was madly in love.
        <p></p>A subtle sense that something was amiss washed over Amane as they ran across the
        <p></p>field. When they got to the goal, the two of them were greeted by Chitose, who seemed
        <p></p>to be in a good mood.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help but make a face when he saw her, but she didn't seem to pay it
        <p></p>any mind.
        <p></p>"What's this, a teaming up?" she marveled. "And here I thought both of you were rivals
        <p></p>in this scavenger hunt…"
        <p></p>"Chitose, you jerk, standing over here grinning like a fool. We're both each other's
        <p></p>item!"
        <p></p>"Uh-huuuh! All right then, let me confirm your items. Who's first?"
        <p></p>"Start with Fujimiya, please."
        <p></p>Amane was surprised to hear Mahiru single him out, but Chitose seemed to
        <p></p>understand why. She gestured to the paper Amane was holding, indicating that he
        <p></p>should hand it over.
        <p></p>It wasn't anything that he particularly needed to hide, so Amane readily showed her
        <p></p>the item he was looking for.
        <p></p>Chitose made a slightly disappointed face when she saw what was written.
        <p></p>But she pulled herself back together and brought her mouth to the microphone with
        <p></p>a smile. "I'm just confirming the item now. The first task for the red team was to find…
        <p></p>'someone you find beautiful'!"
        <p></p>An atmosphere of relief spread through the crowd when the item was read out.
        <p></p>Really, Mahiru had been a safe choice. As far as Amane knew, there was no one in
        <p></p>school more beautiful than her—and of course, she was the cutest in his eyes. Setting
        <p></p>aside Amane's personal opinion, though, nobody would think twice about his choice.
        <p></p>Amane had felt some animosity directed at him when he'd crossed the goal with
        <p></p>Mahiru, but it seemed to have subsided somewhat with the revelation of his object.
        <p></p>The problem lay with Mahiru's item.
        <p></p>Amane didn't know what was written on her slip of paper, but if it somehow
        <p></p>specifically indicated him, he couldn't help but feel whatever it was, it wouldn't be
        <p></p>good for his quiet student life.
        <p></p>Chitose took Mahiru's paper, blinked several times, then looked at Mahiru again.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't see the words from where he was standing, but he could see the
        <p></p>apprehension on Chitose's face. "It's okay for me to say this, right?"
        <p></p>What on earth was the prompt?
        <p></p>After seeing Chitose's reaction, it was even less clear to him now.
        <p></p>Mahiru was still wearing a gentle smile. In other words, she had no problem with
        <p></p>Chitose reading it out loud.
        <p></p>After having confirmed again, Chitose donned her usual smug grin.
        <p></p>"Okay, moving right along, they got to the goal at the same time, but anyway, the first
        <p></p>task for the white team was to find… 'someone important to you'!"
        <p></p>The moment that Chitose's voice echoed across the grounds, a commotion erupted
        <p></p>among the students.
        <p></p>Amane reflexively looked at Mahiru—she was staring right back at him, with her lightpink lips arched
        upward in a smile. 10
        <p></p>It was the smile of a child who'd just pulled off some grand prank, with a bit of
        <p></p>bashfulness mixed in.
        <p></p>Amane was certain she was peering over to gauge his reaction when he learned what
        <p></p>she was looking for.
        <p></p>That cheeky little devil…
        <p></p>Surely it would have been easy for prudent, thoughtful Mahiru to anticipate how their
        <p></p>classmates would react to her prompt. Despite that, Mahiru had selected Amane as
        <p></p>her object. She'd done it in order to bring about a change in their relationship.
        <p></p>From now on, they could never be strangers again.
        <p></p>She was looking at him with her true smile, the one she showed him at home, not the
        <p></p>beautiful, angelic smile that she always had on at school.
        <p></p>Amane grumbled, "We're definitely going to get bombarded with questions after this,"
        <p></p>and ran his hand roughly through his hair.
        <p></p>"What the hell was that, Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>Sure enough, once the morning events had ended and all the students had returned to
        <p></p>their classrooms for lunch, every boy in Amane's class crowded around his desk.
        <p></p>Mahiru, the unattainable girl they all adored, had selected Amane as her "important
        <p></p>person" in front of the whole school. Amane understood why they were upset, but
        <p></p>being suddenly pressed for answers was still quite vexing.
        <p></p>"Why were you with Shiina?! As her 'important person'?"
        <p></p>"More importantly, since when?"
        <p></p>"You were never that close, right?! You just recently started eating lunch together?!"
        <p></p>"What is it?! What is it that she likes about you?!"
        <p></p>"I can't understand it at all!"
        <p></p>Amane faced this rapid barrage of questions with a glassy look in his eyes. Honestly,
        <p></p>he had expected some manner of cross-examination, but under the scrutiny of the
        <p></p>other boys, he wasn't even going to have time to eat lunch.
        <p></p>The boys weren't the only ones reacting to the news. The girls in his class weren't
        <p></p>taking part in the interrogating, but they were shooting him looks, evaluating him,
        <p></p>seeming somewhat amused and relieved.
        <p></p>It was probably because Mahiru, the most popular girl in class, now only had eyes for
        <p></p>him. Their looks of appraisal were attempts to figure out what kind of person Mahiru
        <p></p>had given her heart to.
        <p></p>Amane, who was the focus of attention throughout the classroom, was extremely
        <p></p>uncomfortable.
        <p></p>Mahiru herself was absent—she'd gone to buy a sports drink from a vending machine.
        <p></p>Itsuki and Yuuta wore troubled smiles as they watched the energetic crowd from a
        <p></p>short distance away, and Chitose was enjoying the spectacle with some degree of
        <p></p>excitement.
        <p></p>Suppressing the urge to curse his friends for being so insensitive, Amane faced the
        <p></p>crowd, doing his best to remain composed in front of his classmates. If he wasn't going
        <p></p>to be able to run away anymore, he would have to accept his fate.
        <p></p>Besides, it wasn't like he could disregard Mahiru's feelings. He couldn't ignore the step
        <p></p>that Mahiru had taken or the hand that she had extended to him.
        <p></p>He still wasn't especially confident, but even so, he didn't want to dismiss Mahiru's
        <p></p>bravery in announcing her feelings publicly. With all that in mind, Amane slowly
        <p></p>opened his mouth to speak.
        <p></p>"I can't answer your questions if you shout them all at once," he said, "so at least ask
        <p></p>one at a time."
        <p></p>Amane figured that in any case, it would be better to tell the truth from his own mouth
        <p></p>than to have people spread rumors willy-nilly, so he steeled his nerves and looked
        <p></p>straight at them. The other boys winced.
        <p></p>They hadn't expected Amane to take a proactive stance and open up. It would probably
        <p></p>be more accurate to say they hadn't wanted to imagine it.
        <p></p>"…Since when have you been good friends with Shiina?"
        <p></p>"Since last year," Amane answered with as little enthusiasm as possible. He knew that
        <p></p>he would have to confess that he was the mystery man who was with Mahiru, a fact
        <p></p>which he had previously hidden.
        <p></p>"Huh? Ah, then tell me, the guy we heard rumors about, who was with her at the shrine
        <p></p>visit and over Golden Week, was he…?'
        <p></p>"…Me, yeah."
        <p></p>Once he admitted that, it should have been easy for his classmates to make the
        <p></p>connection between the "important person" who Mahiru had mentioned before with
        <p></p>the "important person" she had just revealed.
        <p></p>Just then, the girl who had apparently seen them on their holiday outing turned to
        <p></p>look at Amane, and he looked away uncomfortably.
        <p></p>He felt a little bummed that everyone knew he was the mystery man now, but Mahiru
        <p></p>had said that she thought he looked cool, so he was happy enough with that for now.
        <p></p>Amane keenly felt the scrutinizing looks grow more intense as he looked out over the
        <p></p>crowd of classmates with the calmest expression he could possibly muster.
        <p></p>"H-how did you become friends?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, you hardly ever interacted! But the real question is why did you pretend to be
        <p></p>strangers at first?"
        <p></p>"Well, we live in the same neighborhood, so that's how we know each other," Amane
        <p></p>explained. "And the reason why we acted like strangers was because I knew that
        <p></p>people would make a fuss just like you're doing now and probably ask a bunch of
        <p></p>prying questions."
        <p></p>There was a wave of understanding and sympathetic murmurs from the crowd when
        <p></p>he pointed that out. He hadn't said anything because he knew they would react like
        <p></p>this. Still, someone must have been unhappy with the idea of their friendship and
        <p></p>grumbled, "I don't get it…"
        <p></p>Amane didn't particularly want them to understand, so he let it go.
        <p></p>"…So, Fujimiya, you're dating Shiina?"
        <p></p>One of his classmates asked the question that was probably on everybody's mind.
        <p></p>Amane smiled calmly.
        <p></p>"We are close, and I'm confident that we're each important to the other, but we're not
        <p></p>dating. I just wish we were."
        <p></p>He wasn't going to use the word love.
        <p></p>After everything that had happened, he only wanted to say that word to the person it
        <p></p>was meant for. Truthfully, the scope of his affection for her included many feelings that
        <p></p>couldn't all be conveyed by a simple phrase. However, if he wanted to be
        <p></p>straightforward, the best way to do it was to say those words to her.
        <p></p>He felt like he was attending his own public execution, but he was at ease knowing
        <p></p>there was no need to hide anymore and that he had been able to be outwardly honest.
        <p></p>"But you said that you weren't interested in the angel."
        <p></p>"That wasn't a lie. I have no interest in any angel. Because the one I have eyes for is a
        <p></p>girl, named Mahiru Shiina."
        <p></p>The person Amane loved wasn't an angel who was brilliant in both academics and
        <p></p>sports, with an attractive face and figure, who was reserved and ladylike and
        <p></p>extremely popular. The person he loved more than anyone else was a girl who worked
        <p></p>hard, who was lonely because of her bad habit of pushing other people away, who was
        <p></p>highly wary, yet extremely vulnerable when she let her guard down—just an ordinary
        <p></p>girl, who was wonderful in a completely normal way.
        <p></p>He loved her, not as the angel, but for everything she was inside. To Amane, the
        <p></p>heavenly mask that Mahiru wore held no interest at all.
        <p></p>In response to Amane's decisive statement, one of the more assertive boys made an
        <p></p>astonished face. With his eyebrows raised, he began to open his mouth to speak.
        <p></p>"Please don't torment him too much, okay?"
        <p></p>The boy froze before he could say anything.
        <p></p>Amane's savior was the other individual at the center of the scandal—Mahiru. She had
        <p></p>just returned to the classroom holding a sports drink that was damp with condensation.
        <p></p>When she made eye contact with Amane, Mahiru smiled gently.
        <p></p>"Amane will be troubled if he's not able to eat lunch during the afternoon break."
        <p></p>Mahiru called him by his first name, something only a close friend would do. She
        <p></p>clearly had no intention of hiding their relationship any longer.
        <p></p>She showed no signs of being bothered by anyone's gawking—boys and girls alike.
        <p></p>Seeming to have run out of patience, the same assertive boy stepped toward her.
        <p></p>The crowd made way for him, sensing that he was going to speak for everybody and
        <p></p>ask the questions they all wanted the answers to. Amane's cross-examination was on
        <p></p>hold for the moment.
        <p></p>"Shiina! Is Fujimiya your 'important person'?" asked the boy.
        <p></p>"Amane is very important me, yes."
        <p></p>Mahiru had on the same gentle expression as she answered decisively.
        <p></p>The boy flinched for a second when she plastered on her flawless angel smile, but he
        <p></p>must have felt the pressure of the crowd behind him, because he continued, albeit a
        <p></p>little less forcefully.
        <p></p>"S-so then, um… does that mean that you… like him?"
        <p></p>"Supposing that I do, what would you have to say about it?"
        <p></p>"W-well, it's just… um, if you were going to fall in love… I want to know, why Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"Why Fujimiya?"
        <p></p>"Ah, well, um, the idea that boring old Fujimiya is dating you, Shiina, it just feels wrong.
        <p></p>There are better guys out there!"
        <p></p>"Is that so?"
        <p></p>Amane stared off into space, anticipating trouble. He knew that the boy had
        <p></p>inadvertently just set off a land mine. 7
        <p></p>Mahiru hated it when Amane put himself down. She also said that she hated his
        <p></p>unfairly given poor reputation. Which meant that she hated it when other people
        <p></p>talked badly about him.
        <p></p>Amane knew that most of his classmates thought he was a very dull person. Unlike
        <p></p>when he was with Mahiru, he never really showed his true personality at school. So
        <p></p>he thought it was a fair judgment.
        <p></p>But when it came to whether Mahiru would be able to accept that appraisal, that was
        <p></p>a different matter.
        <p></p>The look on Mahiru's face did not change. It was the same angelic smile she always
        <p></p>wore at school.
        <p></p>But the tension in the air around her was palpable. There was a dangerous glint in her
        <p></p>caramel-colored eyes, faint enough that someone close to her would just barely be
        <p></p>able to make it out.
        <p></p>"Well, um—"
        <p></p>"And exactly what about him is so boring?"
        <p></p>"Ah, well—"
        <p></p>"Would you please tell me, specifically, what about him is unsatisfactory?"
        <p></p>"Like, his attitude, and his l-l-looks, and—"
        <p></p>"Do you choose who you love based on their face?
        <p></p>"N-no, but—"
        <p></p>"Do you fall in love with people based only on their physical appearance? Will you
        <p></p>select your future long-term partner based on how pretty they look?" 1
        <p></p>As she spoke, Mahiru was still wearing her angelic smile. Despite the friendly
        <p></p>expression, Amane could feel tension radiating off of her. He could tell that Mahiru was
        <p></p>getting angry. 1
        <p></p>Amane could feel the irritation even from a distance, so the boy she was staring down
        <p></p>probably felt like he was drowning in it.
        <p></p>Indeed, he seemed to have sensed that she was displeased, even as she continued
        <p></p>smiling.
        <p></p>Amane could only see the boy's back, but he could tell that his classmate was almost
        <p></p>cowering.
        <p></p>"W-well…"
        <p></p>"Actually, in the first place, I don't think you have any right to tell anyone why they can
        <p></p>or cannot fall in love with someone else." 1
        <p></p>The words that came from Mahiru's lips, which were still in a gentle smile, had a
        <p></p>sharpness to them that contrasted with her mild tone.
        <p></p>She was still smiling, but she was angry enough that now everyone, not just Amane,
        <p></p>could tell.
        <p></p>"I've been a little too harsh, haven't I?" she said. "My apologies." 3
        <p></p>Mahiru saw that her classmate had become speechless, and she finally eased up a
        <p></p>little, giving him an annoyed yet gentle smile. The boy confronting her seemed quite
        <p></p>flustered once he realized that he had made Mahiru, who was always mild-mannered
        <p></p>and cheerful, quite annoyed.
        <p></p>"I'll take the liberty to correct your statements. Amane is a kind and attractive person.
        <p></p>I also think that his quiet, warm presence is simply wonderful. Besides that, he is very
        <p></p>gentlemanly, and he always treats me with utmost respect. He's a wonderful person.
        <p></p>He supports me when I'm having a hard time and is deeply considerate of my feelings.
        <p></p>And at least he never badmouths anyone or tries to get in the way of someone else's 7
        <p></p>romance."
        <p></p>Those words she added at the end were the finishing blow—she had more or less
        <p></p>declared that she could never love someone like the boy who had said disparaging
        <p></p>things about Amane to her face.
        <p></p>"Is there anything more that you wish to say?"
        <p></p>With a sweet smile, she cocked her head and prompted him for a reply.
        <p></p>The classmate had obviously had enough. He shook his head, and said in a halting and
        <p></p>vanishingly small voice, "N-no, there's nothing," then backed away from Mahiru on
        <p></p>unsteady feet.
        <p></p>Free from obstructions, Mahiru's gaze landed on Amane.
        <p></p>She had basically announced her love for him in front of all their classmates, and his
        <p></p>face stiffened as he wondered how he ought to profess his feelings to her. Mahiru was
        <p></p>wearing the best smile he had seen on her yet that day.
        <p></p>It was completely different from her angelic smile—it was the sweet smile full of joy
        <p></p>that she showed him at home.
        <p></p>"Let's eat lunch together, Amane."
        <p></p>"…Yeah."
        <p></p>No more boys stepped up to interrogate him.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru really had a lot to say, huh?" Amane mumbled. He had gathered with his
        <p></p>classmates to prepare for the cavalry battle, several events after the start of the
        <p></p>afternoon program.
        <p></p>"I think it's a shame it had to happen like that," Yuuta said.
        <p></p>Amane furrowed his eyebrows at Yuuta's comment.
        <p></p>The two of them were standing some ways away from the tent because it was annoying
        <p></p>to be stared at.
        <p></p>People were still looking his way, but it was at least a little better with some distance.
        <p></p>Yuuta's words implied that Amane should have been the one to make the first move.
        <p></p>Amane had no way to refute him.
        <p></p>"I think I get it, but… were Fujimiya and Shiina really that close?" Makoto asked
        <p></p>curiously. He seemed a little suspicious of Amane and Mahiru's relationship.
        <p></p>"Mm, honestly, I wondered why they weren't already dating!" Yuuta replied. "If
        <p></p>anything, I'm impressed that Shiina was able to hold out this long."
        <p></p>"She really hid it well. Which is understandable, seeing the uproar today at lunch. That
        <p></p>was awful, huh?"
        <p></p>Makoto looked at Amane with pity.
        <p></p>Makoto and Kazuya had been in the classroom, but as one might expect, they hadn't
        <p></p>been able to speak to Amane while he was being surrounded and questioned. Amane
        <p></p>didn't mind, since he wasn't very good friends with them, but he would have
        <p></p>appreciated a little help from Itsuki or Yuuta, at least.
        <p></p>"That was really something else. Those guys looked so pathetic, but man, it felt good 1
        <p></p>to watch Shiina shut them all down," Kazuya remarked.
        <p></p>"They looked miserable, but I think maybe from their perspective, it was just too hard
        <p></p>to believe…"
        <p></p>"Hmm, you think so? But a guy ought to tell the girl he likes how he feels to her face,
        <p></p>right? So it's pretty difficult to pine after somebody when you're not willing to make a
        <p></p>move. Just wishing you could have whatever you want without taking any risks, and
        <p></p>then whining about it when you don't get your way… it's childish. And then to insult
        <p></p>Fujimiya on top of it all? Beyond pathetic." 1
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help but groan. The idea that a man should confess his feelings
        <p></p>affected Amane quite deeply. 1
        <p></p>"Kazuya, something you said is bothering Fujimiya…"
        <p></p>"Well, from what I can see, Fujimiya was already pretty irritated."
        <p></p>"That's because Shiina expressed her feelings first, you see."
        <p></p>That much was obvious.
        <p></p>Now that things had gone so far, neither Amane nor Mahiru could avoid the truth any
        <p></p>longer. There was no question that Mahiru liked Amane.
        <p></p>However, it was clear that the kind of man who sat back without doing anything must
        <p></p>have absolutely no self-respect.
        <p></p>Since Mahiru had expressed her feelings directly, Amane knew he would have to
        <p></p>respond the same way. He'd known what he wanted to say to her for a long time
        <p></p>already; it was just a matter of how to say it.
        <p></p>"I'm planning to tell her properly after we get home. I won't say anything at school."
        <p></p>He felt he should tell her when they were alone, when he could have her all to himself.
        <p></p>Mahiru had already made a public confession, but even so, at least when it came time
        <p></p>for them to convey their feelings to each other, Amane was resolved to do it more
        <p></p>privately.
        <p></p>Kazuya turned to him with a satisfied-looking smile. "Mm, that's the spirit. But first,
        <p></p>we've got some opponents to kick around in the cavalry battle. They're definitely going
        <p></p>to come for us!"
        <p></p>For some reason, Kazuya was grinning gleefully, and Amane gave a strained smile
        <p></p>back.
        <p></p>Makoto, the one who would be riding on all their shoulders, grumbled wearily, "Don't
        <p></p>you think I've got too much responsibility here?" But he sounded more resigned than 1
        <p></p>upset, which was a bit of a relief. "You just follow Kazuya's example, all right, Fujimiya?
        <p></p>Really give 'em a good beating."
        <p></p>"I'll handle it."
        <p></p>Amane knew that he was supposed to be fired up and full of manly vigor, ready to fight
        <p></p>back any competitors for Mahiru's attention.
        <p></p>I'll tell her everything once we get home.
        <p></p>For that reason and more, Amane hoped he would make it through the afternoon in
        <p></p>one piece. The other three boys looked at each other and smiled. 4
        <p></p>"That was awful…"
        <p></p>After rinsing off what felt like a cloud of dust in the bath, Amane flopped down on the
        <p></p>sofa with the feeling of fatigue that always followed vigorous exercise.
        <p></p>Sure enough, the opposing teams had hit them hard during the cavalry battle. But it
        <p></p>wasn't a surprise that they would be particularly aggressive toward Amane's team.
        <p></p>Still, it had caused a lot of trouble for Yuuta and the others.
        <p></p>But Kazuya had gleefully exclaimed, "Now this is youth!" wearing a warlike grin, so it
        <p></p>seemed like he enjoyed that kind of fierce competition.
        <p></p>In the end, Amane's team had not been able to hold out in the face of the white team's
        <p></p>terrible attacks, but thanks to the strenuous efforts of Makoto, who had been on top,
        <p></p>they had nevertheless managed to snatch many more of the other team's headbands
        <p></p>than Amane had expected.
        <p></p>Makoto had been the one doing all the work, but Amane had seen Mahiru, watching
        <p></p>from the sideline, smiling at him.
        <p></p>Just like that, the afternoon program ended. Then came the closing ceremony, followed
        <p></p>by the customary cleanup after the event.
        <p></p>Now Amane was home.
        <p></p>In a lot of ways, the day had been too much to handle, and Amane was already
        <p></p>physically and emotionally exhausted. But it wasn't over just yet.
        <p></p>…I have to tell her.
        <p></p>Mahiru had been brave enough to make her relationship with Amane public; she had
        <p></p>chosen to associate herself with him.
        <p></p>He felt like if he failed to respond to her feelings and put off saying anything, he would
        <p></p>be a disgrace to all men. 2
        <p></p>I wonder how I should say it.
        <p></p>Amane had made up his mind, but he was still plagued by hesitation and indecision. It
        <p></p>was the first time in his life that he was going to earnestly confess his love for someone,
        <p></p>so undoubtedly, he was terrified. 4
        <p></p>He worried whether the atmosphere was romantic enough for a girl like Mahiru and
        <p></p>pondered how he should communicate his feelings so that she would be happy to hear
        <p></p>them. No answers seemed to come as the questions swirled around and around in his
        <p></p>mind.
        <p></p>Amane pressed his fingers to his forehead, thinking over the possibilities, when—
        <p></p>from the front door, he heard a key in the lock.
        <p></p>The sound made him jump because it signaled that the girl occupying his thoughts,
        <p></p>who held the spare key to his apartment, was coming to visit.
        <p></p>It was the first time that sound coming from the entryway had set his nerves on edge.
        <p></p>The door closed, and he heard it lock.
        <p></p>Then he heard the echo of slippers walking across the floor, like little breaths of air,
        <p></p>and… a familiar girl with flaxen hair appeared in the hallway.
        <p></p>"Amane."
        <p></p>Her light-pink lips were curved gently upward in a tender smile, even sweeter than
        <p></p>usual, as though she hadn't been bothered in the slightest by the uproar at school.
        <p></p>Amane felt his heartbeat quicken.
        <p></p>Whether she knew how agitated he was or not, Mahiru sat down beside him, as she
        <p></p>always did.
        <p></p>There was no more than a hand's breadth of distance between them.
        <p></p>When Mahiru straightened herself up, her hair moved in gentle waves, carrying the
        <p></p>sweet smell of her soap. Like Amane, she had taken a bath to wash off all the sweat. If
        <p></p>he looked carefully, he could see that her milky white skin was even smoother and
        <p></p>cleaner than usual.
        <p></p>Amane's whole body grew tense as Mahiru gave him a refreshing smile.
        <p></p>"Amane, I'm sure you probably have lots of things you want to say to me, and things
        <p></p>you want to ask, but… could I ask you to let me say one thing first?"
        <p></p>"S-sure?"
        <p></p>Amane put up his guard, wondering what it could be all of a sudden. Mahiru bowed
        <p></p>her head.
        <p></p>"I feel guilty for putting you on the spot and putting you through what I imagine was
        <p></p>some very unpleasant attention, Amane. I'm so sorry."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"…Well, you see," she continued uneasily, "I sort of… knew that would happen."
        <p></p>Amane understood what she had been anxious about. Mahiru knew how influential
        <p></p>she was; that was precisely why she was always so careful about the way she
        <p></p>presented herself.
        <p></p>So when Mahiru had declared in public that Amane was her "important person," it had
        <p></p>been obvious that her announcement would cause a scene, and yet she had done it
        <p></p>anyway, knowing the consequences.
        <p></p>"W-well, I more or less already figured that you knew what would happen when you
        <p></p>did it, so—"
        <p></p>"You're not angry?"
        <p></p>"I'm not."
        <p></p>"I see, thank goodness."
        <p></p>If anything, as far as Amane was concerned, he'd finally made up his mind precisely
        <p></p>because Mahiru had taken the initiative. And now he knew her level of commitment,
        <p></p>so he wasn't upset with her at all.
        <p></p>Besides, Amane had also prepared himself to confess his feelings for Mahiru.
        <p></p>He took a deep breath and stared into Mahiru's eyes. They were even clearer and
        <p></p>calmer than usual, and gentle enough to make him catch his breath.
        <p></p>"Can I apologize for something, too?" he asked.
        <p></p>"For what?"
        <p></p>"…I'm sorry I've been so cowardly."
        <p></p>Before he could tell her how he felt, there was something else he had to say.
        <p></p>"I'm sorry. I knew how you felt, and I couldn't handle it. I looked away and acted like I
        <p></p>didn't notice and pretended like I couldn't see it."
        <p></p>Amane had always vaguely suspected Mahiru had feelings for him, but he had chosen
        <p></p>to ignore them. He'd piled up the excuses, telling himself that he was so pathetic that
        <p></p>she could never love him as he was, and so on.
        <p></p>But he wasn't going to run anymore.
        <p></p>He needed to confront his feelings and Mahiru's. He wanted to tell her the unvarnished
        <p></p>truth.
        <p></p>Amane stared directly at Mahiru, bracing himself so that he wouldn't turn away this
        <p></p>time, and—Mahiru smiled a little.
        <p></p>"Well, that goes for both of us, doesn't it?" she said. "I did the same thing… I mean, if I
        <p></p>wasn't convinced of how you felt, I never could have taken a step like this."
        <p></p>Mahiru quietly reached out and touched Amane's hand. She was still wearing a faint
        <p></p>smile.
        <p></p>"I told you, didn't I?" she said. "I'm a sly one."
        <p></p>"…I don't know. I think I'm slyer."
        <p></p>Amane smiled wryly, thinking that Mahiru's kind of deviousness was awfully cute.
        <p></p>Suddenly, he pulled his hand away from Mahiru's grasp and instead wrapped both
        <p></p>arms around her and embraced her gently.
        <p></p>He felt her delicate body stiffen with surprise, but then she quickly relaxed in his arms.
        <p></p>Mahiru was leaning against his chest and looking up at him. He could see hints of
        <p></p>bewilderment and anticipation in her caramel-colored eyes.
        <p></p>"…Will you let me start?" Amane whispered.
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded, her cheeks slightly flushed, and pressed herself further into his
        <p></p>embrace.
        <p></p>"Um, so, this is my first time seriously falling for anyone. How can I put this…? I never
        <p></p>thought it would happen… I thought it was impossible."
        <p></p>"…Because of your past?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, that's right." He nodded.
        <p></p>He was still embracing Mahiru, not letting her go.
        <p></p>The reluctance that Amane had felt when it came to telling Mahiru that he loved her,
        <p></p>or recognizing that she loved him in return, could be blamed on the lasting effects of
        <p></p>an incident in middle school.
        <p></p>Amane had no confidence, so he had always been too afraid to express affection
        <p></p>toward anyone. When he'd thought about the possibility of being rejected, he had
        <p></p>decided it was better not to form any attachments.
        <p></p>That ended after he met Mahiru.
        <p></p>"Because of that, I thought that I wasn't capable of falling in love with anyone… But I
        <p></p>never expected someone to change that so easily."
        <p></p>He gazed down again at the girl in his arms. Just looking at her filled his chest with
        <p></p>warmth, and he felt like he might overflow with bashful affection.
        <p></p>Mahiru was the first and possibly the last person who would make him feel this way.
        <p></p>That was how in love he was.
        <p></p>"I've realized that people can change when they meet someone they love."
        <p></p>Amane had certainly changed since meeting Mahiru. Thanks to her, he'd finally been
        <p></p>able to start breaking free of the wall he had built around his heart and had learned to
        <p></p>accept himself bit by bit. The feeling of falling in love with someone had also given rise
        <p></p>to the desire to be loved. He had come to know the feeling of wanting to hold someone
        <p></p>in his arms and cherish them.
        <p></p>"…You know, at first, I didn't think you had much charm," he admitted.
        <p></p>"I know. You told me to my face."
        <p></p>"I'm sorry about that, really."
        <p></p>Back then, neither of them had thought too highly of the other, and he had said some
        <p></p>rude things to her. Mahiru had probably also thought that Amane was an unfriendly,
        <p></p>undisciplined loser.
        <p></p>"…You know, when we met, you wouldn't open up to me. You were so distant, but I
        <p></p>figured it was okay as long as we got along all right… But before I knew it, that wasn't
        <p></p>enough anymore."
        <p></p>When they first met, Amane hadn't wanted to get pointlessly involved with Mahiru. He
        <p></p>wondered when that had changed.
        <p></p>"I came to feel like I wanted to learn more about you. I wanted to get to know you.
        <p></p>From the bottom of my heart, I wanted to cherish you. I… wanted to be with you. That
        <p></p>was the first time I'd ever felt like that."
        <p></p>"…I see."
        <p></p>"I've been holding back this whole time. But… you told me I was enough, so I didn't
        <p></p>give up. I tried to think about what I could do to become a better person for you. But,
        <p></p>well, before I could do anything, you took the first step."
        <p></p>"Heh-heh… I was holding back too, you know. You're pretty cool, Amane, and I was
        <p></p>worried that someone else might come along and snatch you up. I was anxious about
        <p></p>whether you'd even like me or not."
        <p></p>"I think you were the only one who was worried about that."
        <p></p>"Hmm. That again…"
        <p></p>Mahiru looked unhappy when Amane put himself down again. But when she noticed
        <p></p>his expression, she blinked several times.
        <p></p>Amane wasn't wearing the pitiful face that Mahiru was always so quick to criticize.
        <p></p>Instead, his eyes were serious and had the look of someone who had prepared himself
        <p></p>to do something especially difficult.
        <p></p>"…So, from now on… I'm going to work hard, so that it's not weird when people see us
        <p></p>together."
        <p></p>"Huh?"
        <p></p>"I'm going to become a man who does my best so that no one will tell you that we're
        <p></p>mismatched ever again… And even if I can't do it, I still want to improve enough to feel
        <p></p>proud of myself."
        <p></p>Amane wanted to become the kind of man who was worthy of standing proudly by
        <p></p>Mahiru's side, so that no one could object to their relationship. Not only for Mahiru's
        <p></p>sake, but for his own as well. And so that he could have confidence in himself.
        <p></p>The first step down that path had to start with these words.
        <p></p>"I love you, Mahiru, more than anyone else. Will you be my girlfriend?" 19
        <p></p>He stared into her clear, caramel-colored eyes and whispered his confession. Her
        <p></p>serene eyes glistened with tears, but not a single drop spilled down her cheeks. Amane 
        <p></p>was the only thing reflected in her dewy eyes.
        <p></p>Mahiru closed her eyes and smiled.
        <p></p>"…Yes." 9
        <p></p>Mahiru's answer was so quiet that even if anybody else had been in the room, Amane
        <p></p>would still have been the only one to hear it. Yet her trembling voice conveyed her
        <p></p>unmistakable agreement.
        <p></p>Mahiru buried her face in Amane's chest again. Her arms wrapped tightly around his
        <p></p>back, holding him firmly in place and not letting go. It was like she was telling him that
        <p></p>she wasn't going to let him get away.
        <p></p>Feeling a little embarrassed, Amane also wrapped his arms securely around Mahiru's
        <p></p>small back. 6
        <p></p>—I'll never let you go.
        <p></p>I want to treasure you. I want to bring you joy. I want to love you.
        <p></p>Mahiru was the first person to make him feel that way.
        <p></p>"I want to make you happy, Mahiru."
        <p></p>"Is that a promise, Amane?"
        <p></p>Mahiru slowly lifted her face and gave Amane an impish smirk, so he smiled and
        <p></p>lowered his lips to her ear.
        <p></p>"This is my wish. So I promise, right now… I will cherish you, and make you happy,
        <p></p>absolutely," he pledged passionately.
        <p></p>"…Mm."
        <p></p>Mahiru nodded and gave Amane a sweet smile that melted his heart.

        Chapter 54: The Day After the Confession
        <p></p>Mahiru and I are dating.
        <p></p>If he was to put it into words, he could have summarized
        <p></p>it in that one short sentence, but Amane's heart was
        <p></p>overflowing with so much emotion that he could barely
        <p></p>string a thought together.
        <p></p>The night after the confession, after Mahiru had returned
        <p></p>to her own apartment, Amane had found himself feeling
        <p></p>restless and in a dreamy haze.
        <p></p>He shared a new bond with his first love: the girl he'd
        <p></p>fallen head over heels for. It made sense that he would be
        <p></p>ecstatic.
        <p></p>It really hadn't been that long since they'd first met—just
        <p></p>over half a year—and yet, having spent those days pining
        <p></p>away, so close to the object of his unrequited love, it had felt
        <p></p>like a very long time indeed.
        <p></p>Shortly after the beginning of the new year, Amane
        <p></p>realized he had feelings for Mahiru, meaning he had spent
        <p></p>about four months in such a state.
        <p></p>Whether it had been "just four months" or "four long
        <p></p>months" depended on perspective, but for Amane, it felt like
        <p></p>forever. The saying goes that "first love bears no fruit," but
        <p></p>in Amane and Mahiru's case, that didn't seem to apply.
        <p></p>Amane was happy that they were together now, but
        <p></p>without the slightest bit of experience, he had no idea what
        <p></p>he ought to do next. He didn't know how he should act
        <p></p>around her the following day.
        <p></p>Kept awake all night by a combination of joy and
        <p></p>apprehension, Amane was rather sleep-deprived when he
        <p></p>welcomed Mahiru into his apartment the day after they
        <p></p>confessed to each other.
        <p></p>"…Um, g-good morning."
        <p></p>Mahiru, who had come to say good morning at an hour
        <p></p>much closer to the afternoon, was wearing a big smile that
        <p></p>completely failed to hide the fact that she felt just as
        <p></p>awkward as Amane.
        <p></p>The day after Sports Day was a school holiday, so it wasn't
        <p></p>unusual for Mahiru to come over. She had visited frequently
        <p></p>before they started dating, too, so it wasn't particularly
        <p></p>strange. She was a familiar figure at home.
        <p></p>What had changed was the feeling of distance between
        <p></p>them, thanks to their new relationship. It somehow seemed
        <p></p>like they were further apart compared to before.
        <p></p>Normally, because she was so used to it, Mahiru would
        <p></p>walk through the door like it was her own house, making
        <p></p>herself at home, but…today, she seemed somehow tense.
        <p></p>However, Amane's nervousness was much worse. He
        <p></p>couldn't even muster his usual lighthearted greeting and
        <p></p>instead let his eyes wander nervously around the room as he
        <p></p>finally managed to reply in a quiet voice, "…Morning."
        <p></p>Then they both took their seats on the living room sofa,
        <p></p>leaving a wider-than-usual space between them. 6
        <p></p>"Um… A-Amane, you look a little sleepy."
        <p></p>"Yeah, well…how do I put this? I was so happy that I
        <p></p>couldn't really sleep," Amane mumbled, sounding flustered.
        <p></p>Mahiru's cheeks became redder, as if she knew exactly
        <p></p>what he meant. "I—I must be pretty carefree, since I slept
        <p></p>quite well, feeling happy and fortunate…"
        <p></p>"N-no, I think that's great! I just—I was thinking about all
        <p></p>sorts of things and was too worked up, like a little kid the
        <p></p>night before a field trip!"
        <p></p>"…So you're happy, too?"
        <p></p>"Well, yeah… Of course I am, now that I know the girl I
        <p></p>like feels the same way… I'm so happy that my head can't
        <p></p>stop spinning."
        <p></p>Amane had never done this sort of thing before, so he was
        <p></p>practically trembling with joy at the idea that the person he
        <p></p>liked reciprocated his feelings. However, he still had no idea
        <p></p>how he should act toward Mahiru. He was at a total loss.
        <p></p>His parents' relationship wasn't a good reference, either.
        <p></p>Amane did think the two of them got along better than
        <p></p>average, maybe even a little too well. Even though they only
        <p></p>did so inside the house, they were openly affectionate.
        <p></p>Amane felt like trying to use his parents as an example
        <p></p>would only lead to embarrassment.
        <p></p>So Amane was wrestling with the problem of how to act
        <p></p>toward his new girlfriend as he answered. Mahiru put on a
        <p></p>soft, effortless smile and started to lean on Amane, so—
        <p></p>without thinking—he grabbed her shoulder and stopped her.
        <p></p>Mahiru's expression stiffened immediately, and Amane
        <p></p>knew that he had messed up. He pulled back the hand that
        <p></p>he'd put up to stop her and waved it in front of his face. 4
        <p></p>"Th-that's not— It's not that I don't want to… Just, it's
        <p></p>like, I feel awkward again, about getting close to you. When
        <p></p>you go for it so suddenly, somehow it's kind of embarrassing,
        <p></p>don't you think?"
        <p></p>He tacked on the lame question at the end because he was uncomfortable. 
        <p></p>They had been close enough to touch plenty of times
        <p></p>before, to the point where it had become normal, but now
        <p></p>that their relationship had changed, sitting at the usual
        <p></p>distance somehow made Amane nervous.
        <p></p>It wasn't that he hadn't felt embarrassed before, but now
        <p></p>that his perception of Mahiru had changed, he was overly
        <p></p>conscious of her.
        <p></p>"…When I think about you being my girlfriend, I can't
        <p></p>settle down. It's my first time dating anyone, and…"
        <p></p>"I mean, it's not like I'm perfectly composed, either, but…I
        <p></p>guess my feeling of wanting to stay close is stronger. N-now
        <p></p>that we've finally started dating…I think it's best if we are
        <p></p>honest about our feelings."
        <p></p>Mahiru's voice trembled with slight bashfulness as she
        <p></p>mumbled those words, looking up at Amane timidly. The
        <p></p>effect was so charming that Amane stifled his groan.
        <p></p>"So could I get a little…closer?" she asked.
        <p></p>"…Feel free."
        <p></p>If he was being honest, Amane wanted nothing more than
        <p></p>to grab Mahiru and squeeze her tightly like a stuffed animal, 6
        <p></p>to revel in the joy that was welling up inside of him. But he
        <p></p>had a feeling that if he allowed himself to do that, he might
        <p></p>end up doing something really embarrassing and regret it
        <p></p>afterward, so he decided to limit himself to light cuddling.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed to be happy with it, as she leaned against
        <p></p>Amane's arm with a cherubic look of joy on her smiling face.
        <p></p>As a matter of fact, even before they had started dating,
        <p></p>Mahiru had recently become quite clingy. The fact that he
        <p></p>felt more nervous about it than he had before was probably
        <p></p>because he lacked both courage and experience in these
        <p></p>situations.
        <p></p>…I wonder what I should do now?
        <p></p>He worried over whether just cuddling was enough.
        <p></p>Amane had zero dating experience, and Mahiru was his
        <p></p>first girlfriend.
        <p></p>Mahiru was in the same situation, but still, Amane
        <p></p>couldn't help but want to take the lead, as a guy.
        <p></p>But as much as he wanted to take the initiative, he had no
        <p></p>idea how.
        <p></p>Partly because of what had happened to him in the past,
        <p></p>Amane had never shown a lot of interest in others, and since
        <p></p>he'd never been much of a romantic, he'd never even
        <p></p>dreamed about dating a girl. Sadly, Amane's energy had
        <p></p>always been directed toward his studies and hobbies, and he
        <p></p>completely lacked any knowledge when it came to the
        <p></p>essential subject of romance.
        <p></p>Amane's meager understanding was limited to the fact
        <p></p>that boys and girls who were dating held hands, went on
        <p></p>dates, and kissed—and might get more physical once their
        <p></p>relationship became more serious.
        <p></p>Aside from holding hands and going on dates,
        <p></p>he couldn't even imagine suddenly kissing her — 
        <p></p>or doing anything else, for that matter.
        <p></p>So Amane settled on the idea that they
        <p></p>should go out, but he knew that that alone wasn't really
        <p></p>"dating."
        <p></p>Amane wanted to make Mahiru happy, and for the two of
        <p></p>them to be happy together, but he felt slightly hopeless at
        <p></p>the realization that he had absolutely no idea how to go
        <p></p>about it.
        <p></p>"…What's the matter?" Mahiru asked. "D-do you not like
        <p></p>me leaning on you after all…?"
        <p></p>"Ah, no, that's not it. Sorry for making you worry."
        <p></p>Mahiru was staring at Amane, who had been silently
        <p></p>fretting with a serious look on his face. He felt pathetic for
        <p></p>giving her the wrong idea that he didn't like feeling her
        <p></p>touch.
        <p></p>"I was just wondering about something… Well, I think I
        <p></p>can probably ask you, since it involves you, too…"
        <p></p>"S-sure."
        <p></p>Amane felt bad about asking her, since this was her first
        <p></p>time dating anyone as well, but he decided it might be good
        <p></p>to consult with her, as fellow first timers. Surely it was better
        <p></p>to talk things through together, rather than worrying alone.
        <p></p>"So listen, we, um… We've started dating, but…"
        <p></p>"Yes?"
        <p></p>"…Now that we are, what, specifically, should we do?""Huh?" 2
        <p></p>Mahiru had obviously been bracing herself, unsure of
        <p></p>what kind of question was headed her way. She looked
        <p></p>surprised.
        <p></p>Even though Amane was self-conscious about asking such
        <p></p>a stupid question, even for him, he was asking earnestly.
        <p></p>"…W-well, it's my first time dating anyone, and…I don't
        <p></p>know exactly what we're supposed to do."
        <p></p>"…N-now that you mention it…," she replied.
        <p></p>But as he had expected, Mahiru, who had also never had
        <p></p>much experience with the opposite sex, was similarly
        <p></p>stumped by Amane's conundrum.
        <p></p>"Does anything come to mind?"
        <p></p>"…Holding hands?"
        <p></p>"We do that all the time."
        <p></p>"Spending days off together?"
        <p></p>"That's every day."
        <p></p>"Going out?"
        <p></p>"Well, we've been doing that."
        <p></p>"Hugging?"
        <p></p>"We do that."
        <p></p>Unfortunately, it seemed that Mahiru didn't know any more
        <p></p>than Amane, and everything she brought up was
        <p></p>something they'd already done. She couldn't come up with
        <p></p>anything more that couples were supposed to do together. It
        <p></p>seemed like there was nothing else.
        <p></p>What do couples do…?
        <p></p>Amane sighed, and Mahiru tugged nervously at the hem
        <p></p>of his shirt. When he looked at her again, wondering what
        <p></p>was wrong, he saw that her face was flushed slightly red.
        <p></p>"…So it's hard to say this, or rather, it's embarrassing,
        <p></p>but… Haven't we been doing all the things that couples do 7
        <p></p>together, just without calling it dating…?"
        <p></p>After Mahiru said that, a silence fell over the room.
        <p></p>…Now that she's said it out loud… No, even if she hadn't
        <p></p>said anything, she's right…!
        <p></p>They had been spending time in the same space, holding
        <p></p>hands, and going out together as if it was totally natural, but
        <p></p>those were things that boys and girls normally did when they
        <p></p>were in a relationship.
        <p></p>Of course, even though it might have been clear at first,
        <p></p>maybe he hadn't realized that these activities had become
        <p></p>entirely commonplace for them.
        <p></p>"I—I also wanted you to notice me, and I did my very best
        <p></p>to make it happen, but…when I really think about it, Amane,
        <p></p>I was doing things that a girlfriend does, wasn't I?"
        <p></p>"…N-now that you mention it…"
        <p></p>"So maybe, rather than trying to act like a couple, we should just act like normal…touching each other,
        and
        <p></p>spending time together, and stuff. Besides, isn't it better if,
        <p></p>instead of forcing ourselves to conform and overthink
        <p></p>everything, we just do it our own way…I mean, date the way
        <p></p>we want to…?"
        <p></p>Amane felt a weight had lifted at the words our own way.
        <p></p>…Maybe we don't have to worry about how other people
        <p></p>do things?
        <p></p>Amane had been anxious to act the part of a boyfriend,
        <p></p>but there was really no need to worry about that. Mahiru
        <p></p>liked Amane, and Amane liked Mahiru, so they were
        <p></p>together. As long as those things were true, everything was
        <p></p>fine. They could take their time and didn't have to rush or
        <p></p>push themselves.
        <p></p>"You're right. I'm sorry, I just… You know I always
        <p></p>overthink things. This is my first time, so I really don't know
        <p></p>what I'm doing."
        <p></p>"…Right."
        <p></p>"So what, then? …We'll act like we always have, but…from
        <p></p>now on, like, with love?"
        <p></p>With his mind made up, Amane took Mahiru's hand in
        <p></p>his. Her cheeks, which were already quite red, flushed even
        <p></p>more. She cast her eyes down as if she was embarrassed but
        <p></p>squeezed his hand back and leaned against his arm.
        <p></p>"Amane?"
        <p></p>"Yeah?" "…I'm happy, just like this."
        <p></p>"Me too." 2
        <p></p>Amane agreed with her quietly whispered words, and he
        <p></p>silently enjoyed the feeling of warmth against his side.
        <p></p>Chapter 55: Going to School Together and Making a Debut
        <p></p>"Amane, wake up please."
        <p></p>There was a gentle voice calling his name.
        <p></p>In the midst of a comfortable slumber, he answered the
        <p></p>soft whispering voice with a short "Mm," raised his heavy
        <p></p>eyelids, and slowly opened his eyes.
        <p></p>The blurry figure of a lovely girl appeared before him,
        <p></p>faintly illuminated by the sunlight streaming in through the
        <p></p>window.
        <p></p>She seemed to have put one knee up on the bed to shake 2
        <p></p>him awake and was leaning forward, her hemp-colored hair
        <p></p>cascading around her like wisteria vines that swayed with
        <p></p>her every movement.
        <p></p>"…Mahiru?"
        <p></p>"Yes. Good morning."
        <p></p>When he called out her name to confirm it was her, she
        <p></p>nodded and answered in a familiar voice.
        <p></p>Amane didn't think he'd overslept, so he was having a
        <p></p>little trouble figuring out why Mahiru was in his bedroom. 1
        <p></p>She was there as if it was the most natural thing in the
        <p></p>world, further deepening his confusion. "…Morning. Why are you here?"
        <p></p>"Don't you remember what we talked about yesterday?"
        <p></p>Mahiru frowned slightly.
        <p></p>"Yesterday?" he replied, then recalled their exchange from
        <p></p>the previous evening.
        <p></p>"Beginning this Monday, could we start walking to school
        <p></p>together?"
        <p></p>Mahiru had brought up the question as they were parting
        <p></p>on Sunday night.
        <p></p>She'd looked up at him uneasily, fidgeting as if she
        <p></p>couldn't settle down, which made him a little nervous, too.
        <p></p>Mahiru had probably spoken cautiously in order to see
        <p></p>whether Amane was planning to conceal their relationship.
        <p></p>They had already talked it over and decided to go public, but
        <p></p>she still seemed worried about it.
        <p></p>As far as Amane was concerned, they had basically
        <p></p>confessed their love to the world already, so he hadn't even
        <p></p>considered keeping it a secret. Rather, he fully intended to
        <p></p>tell people they were dating now.
        <p></p>"Yeah, sure."
        <p></p>"R-really?"
        <p></p>"What would I get out of lying?"
        <p></p>When she had heard Amane's answer, the tinge of anxiety
        <p></p>in Mahiru's eyes disappeared, replaced by shades of delight.
        <p></p>Amane's heart fluttered when he'd heard her whisper
        <p></p>bashfully, "I've always wanted to walk to school together,"
        <p></p>but she hadn't seemed to notice his agitation.
        <p></p>"All right, then, I'll come over to your place in the
        <p></p>morning," she'd said brightly. "While we're at it, we may as
        <p></p>well eat breakfast together."
        <p></p>"Oh, sweet. I get to eat Mahiru's cooking first thing in the
        <p></p>morning."
        <p></p>"It's just going to be leftovers… Is it all right if I make you
        <p></p>a lunch box, too?"
        <p></p>"I would like nothing better."
        <p></p>Amane would have been perfectly content with the
        <p></p>breakfasts that Mahiru made, so he couldn't help but feel
        <p></p>delighted for a chance to eat her cooking at lunch, too.
        <p></p>The thought that she wouldn't have to restrain herself in
        <p></p>front of other people anymore had Mahiru beaming with
        <p></p>happiness, and Amane was glad to see that whenever she'd
        <p></p>looked at him. At the same time, it made him feel a bit
        <p></p>embarrassed.
        <p></p>We'll start going together tomorrow, huh?
        <p></p>Up to that point, he had been staggering his commutes in
        <p></p>order to avoid giving anyone clues about his relationship
        <p></p>with Mahiru.
        <p></p>But going forward, that would no longer be necessary.
        <p></p>Being open about their relationship at school was sure to
        <p></p>make others jealous of him, which was worrying,
        <p></p>but the most important thing was that it would make Mahiru happy.
        <p></p>Being by her side was enough for him.
        <p></p>Amane gazed at Mahiru, who was smiling happily, and
        <p></p>mumbled quietly, "I guess I've got my work cut out for me."
        <p></p>"…Ah—"
        <p></p>As his brain fog started to clear, Amane groaned a little
        <p></p>when he remembered their conversation from the previous
        <p></p>night.
        <p></p>He wasn't opposed to the idea, but seeing Mahiru first
        <p></p>thing in the morning surprised him and made him forget.
        <p></p>Mahiru watched Amane's reaction with an exasperated
        <p></p>look.
        <p></p>But she didn't seem that irritated, rather she looked
        <p></p>amused to be chiding Amane for his hopelessness, so Amane
        <p></p>pouted his lips in apology.
        <p></p>"Good grief, you're so forgetful… Well, go on—get dressed
        <p></p>and wash your face."
        <p></p>"Okay."
        <p></p>Mahiru was probably going to prepare their meals while
        <p></p>he did that.
        <p></p>Suppressing a yawn, Amane got up out of bed and took off
        <p></p>the shirt he was wearing. He heard a sudden shriek from
        <p></p>right beside him. "Hyah!"
        <p></p>He tossed his shirt on the bed, then looked at Mahiru,
        <p></p>who had her eyes firmly closed and was trembling. Her cheeks were red.
        <p></p>"L-listen, I told you this before, but please don't change in
        <p></p>front of me," she said, clearly agitated from seeing him take
        <p></p>off his shirt.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't help but smile wryly.
        <p></p>"I'm a guy, so I don't really mind if you see me."
        <p></p>"Well, I do…"
        <p></p>"Look, I'm not trying to show off or anything, and I'm not
        <p></p>going to tell you that you have to get used to it or whatever,
        <p></p>but we won't be able to go to a lot of summer staples like the
        <p></p>pool if you let this bother you."
        <p></p>Amane wondered how Mahiru had gotten by up until
        <p></p>now, since she was apparently not accustomed to seeing
        <p></p>boys' bodies… But since she didn't know how to swim, she 1
        <p></p>had probably always come up with some reason or another
        <p></p>to sit out of swim classes at school.
        <p></p>Amane couldn't imagine Mahiru, who was so serious by
        <p></p>nature, skipping a class, but since she really didn't know
        <p></p>how to swim, and had purposely chosen a high school where
        <p></p>swimming wasn't a required subject, she must have
        <p></p>managed somehow.
        <p></p>They had talked about possibly visiting the pool over the
        <p></p>summer, which would be difficult if she was overly
        <p></p>conscious. Actually, at the pool, all the boys would be half
        <p></p>naked. Amane was starting to worry if she would be able to
        <p></p>take it.
        <p></p>"Uh… I—I can handle it…," Mahiru responded,
        <p></p>almost groaning in a feeble voice. She must have also been
        <p></p>self-conscious about her reaction. Then she timidly opened her
        <p></p>eyes and looked at Amane's body.
        <p></p>Almost on the verge of tears and shaking, with a bright-red face
        <p></p> Mahiru groaned after peering at his upper half.
        <p></p>Frankly, Amane didn't think he made for a particularly
        <p></p>salacious tableau. He'd been exercising more and adding to
        <p></p>his training regimen in an effort to become a better match
        <p></p>for Mahiru. Compared to when they'd first met, his figure
        <p></p>was much more robust. Faint bulges of muscle were just
        <p></p>starting to show on his body. But it wasn't something so
        <p></p>impressive as to force Mahiru to avert her eyes.
        <p></p>…If she can't get used to this, it's going to mean trouble
        <p></p>when we go all the way. 14
        <p></p>Amane figured that was probably a long way off, but it
        <p></p>would still pose some difficulty if their relationship was
        <p></p>going to develop past a certain point.
        <p></p>But Amane was positive that he would also freeze in his
        <p></p>tracks if he ever saw Mahiru similarly exposed, so it was 3
        <p></p>probably going to be an issue for both of them.
        <p></p>Amane's own face was now red, as he imagined
        <p></p>impossible scenarios, so he spoke to Mahiru, whose face was
        <p></p>just as flushed. "…Uh, so, um… Would you please go make
        <p></p>food?"
        <p></p>"Yeah, I think I'll do that," she replied, scampering out of
        <p></p>the room as fast as she could.
        <p></p>After Mahiru was gone, Amane banged his head on the
        <p></p>nearest wall and let out a small groan. "What was she thinking, so early in the morning?"
        <p></p>Amane stared into the mirror. The person staring back
        <p></p>seemed unfamiliar somehow.
        <p></p>Even though he was dressed in his school uniform as
        <p></p>usual, Amane looked like a different person from the neck
        <p></p>up. Or rather, he looked like a version of himself that he only
        <p></p>ever showed Mahiru—a version that seemed out of place in
        <p></p>his uniform.
        <p></p>Sweeping back his black bangs, Amane teased and
        <p></p>adjusted his hair with his fingertips. He knew he had it easy
        <p></p>compared to girls his age, since he didn't have to apply
        <p></p>makeup or anything, but even so, he wasn't used to carefully
        <p></p>arranging his hair like this.
        <p></p>"…Amane?"
        <p></p>A voice called out to him from behind.
        <p></p>Reflected in the mirror was Mahiru, who had finished
        <p></p>getting ready to leave for school and had come to summon
        <p></p>Amane from the sink.
        <p></p>When he turned around and looked straight at her, he saw
        <p></p>that she had a slightly clouded expression.
        <p></p>"What's the matter?" he asked.
        <p></p>"…Don't you hate that?"
        <p></p>"Hate what?"
        <p></p>"…That hairstyle?" "Oh, that."
        <p></p>She broached the topic with some hesitation, and her
        <p></p>words made Amane worry.
        <p></p>Mahiru seemed anxious about Amane admitting to being
        <p></p>her "mystery man." He'd always rejected the idea of styling
        <p></p>his hair this way before going to school.
        <p></p>As far as Amane was concerned, however, he'd taken the
        <p></p>time to dress himself up because he'd wanted to. It would
        <p></p>have been a lie to say he didn't feel at least a little nervous,
        <p></p>but since he had resolved to stand confidently by Mahiru's
        <p></p>side, he wanted to go with a look that wouldn't make her
        <p></p>embarrassed to be seen with him.
        <p></p>He wasn't necessarily going to stand out as some hunk,
        <p></p>but this look had gotten the seal of approval from Itsuki and
        <p></p>Yuuta. For now, Amane was just hoping nobody would
        <p></p>question Mahiru's tastes in men.
        <p></p>"Not really; I don't hate it. Do you?" he asked.
        <p></p>"…I don't hate it, but…I'm just feeling a bit conflicted."
        <p></p>"Conflicted?"
        <p></p>"…I might have a hard time keeping you all to myself." 9
        <p></p>Mahiru looked undeniably sweet as she bashfully
        <p></p>mumbled those charming words. Amane gave a little smile
        <p></p>and gently stroked her head, being careful not to muss her
        <p></p>hair.
        <p></p>"Well, why not enjoy having me to yourself while you still 4
        <p></p>can?" "…I think I will."
        <p></p>Honestly, he had meant it as a joke, but Mahiru nodded
        <p></p>obediently and pressed herself against Amane's chest.
        <p></p>He had never expected her to agree, and he cringed a little
        <p></p>when he realized he had said something that sounded
        <p></p>presumptuous, but his lips curled naturally into a smile as
        <p></p>he felt her forehead against his body.
        <p></p>There was nothing strange about his hand moving on its
        <p></p>own to stroke her hair, in response to her overwhelming
        <p></p>cuteness.
        <p></p>Mahiru was about one head shorter than him and had her
        <p></p>face buried in his chest, clutching the fabric of his shirt so he
        <p></p>couldn't pull away.
        <p></p>But when she glanced up at him, she looked somehow
        <p></p>lonely.
        <p></p>"…You're really cool, so I feel like lots of other girls are
        <p></p>going to talk to you. I'm happy they'll see you for what you
        <p></p>really are, but…"
        <p></p>"Leaving aside whether I'm actually cool or not, do you
        <p></p>think I have eyes for anyone other than you?"
        <p></p>"No, I don't, but it's an emotional issue." 3
        <p></p>"Jealousy?"
        <p></p>When Amane asked this without thinking, Mahiru's
        <p></p>cheeks instantly flushed, but she affirmed his guess with a
        <p></p>meek yes before rubbing her forehead into his chest again. She must have been really embarrassed. Even
        her ears,
        <p></p>peeking out from her flaxen hair, were a deep red.
        <p></p>"It's all right. Even if another girl does talk to me, I'm not
        <p></p>interested in anyone but you, Mahiru." 8
        <p></p>He knew that probably wasn't enough to quell her anxiety,
        <p></p>but Amane really didn't think about other girls in a romantic
        <p></p>way. His attention would not be diverted so long as he had
        <p></p>this beloved girlfriend who was burning with adorable
        <p></p>jealousy.
        <p></p>Amane was naturally apathetic toward unfamiliar people
        <p></p>anyway, so he was confident he wouldn't even take notice of
        <p></p>any other girls. And the type of girl who would suddenly
        <p></p>show interest in him because of his new appearance was the
        <p></p>kind he didn't want to get to know in the first place.
        <p></p>"…I know that. That's why I'm reminding you of my
