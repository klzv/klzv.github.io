        "Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not interested in boys, either. Look, I've got eyes. It's<p></p>
        not that I don't think she's cute—I mean, she's obviously very beautiful, and she has a<p></p>
        good personality. But that doesn't mean I have to fall in love with her or anything."<p></p>
        "Then what do you like, Fujimiya?!"<p></p>
        The boys made a dissatisfied racket, causing their classmates to glance over, which<p></p>
        was slightly awkward.<p></p>
        Leaving aside the fact that he was actually enamored with Mahiru, Amane didn't<p></p>
        understand the reasoning that just because there was a cute, kind, perfect girl around<p></p>
        that he must, as a member of the opposite sex, be in love with her. If that was true,<p></p>
        wouldn't every boy in school be lovestruck?<p></p>
        Just looking around their classroom, it was clear that not every single boy was head<p></p>
        over heels for Mahiru. There were people who appreciated her as one would a piece<p></p>
        of art, and there were plenty of boys who were in love with other girls. Of course, that<p></p>
        didn't change the fact that she was extremely easy to idolize.<p></p>
        "Lemme ask you: What do you guys like about the angel?" Amane muttered with some<p></p>
        exasperation, and the two boys' expressions became lively, as if they were finally<p></p>
        interested.<p></p>
        "She's super cute, and nice to everyone, and so neat and ladylike, and she can do<p></p>
        anything! Wouldn't it just be the greatest to have her as your girlfriend?"<p></p>
        "Huh… right…," Amane mumbled. He knew what they were trying to say, but he gave<p></p>
        them a skeptical glance questioning whether those were reasons enough to love her.<p></p>
        "She really is beautiful, and her figure is ideal, too. Like an angel out of a daydream or<p></p>
        something. I mean, she is an angel, but—"<p></p>
        "It's not just that she's cute and has a good personality; she seriously can do anything<p></p>
        she tries her hand at. Even her figure is extraordinary. Though usually her assets are<p></p>
        hidden under her uniform… But trust me, she looks amazing in her gym clothes.<p></p>
        Insanely impressive."<p></p>
        "That's… crazy all right," Amane muttered.<p></p>
        "I like flat girls like Shirakawa, too, but man, you know, girls with big ones are just the<p></p>
        best. It's every guy's dream."<p></p>
        "You guys are being rude. I think it'd be better if you all shut up now, for everyone's<p></p>
        sake."<p></p>
        Amane was suddenly in a rather unpleasant mood.<p></p>
        He could feel the sharp stares trained in their direction from around the room, and<p></p>
        even though he knew they weren't pointed at him, exactly, it was still enough to make<p></p>
        his blood run cold. Amane didn't have to look to know just who was giving him the<p></p>
        angriest glares. He was not looking forward to dealing with that later.<p></p>
        The last thing Amane wanted was for people to lump him together with these two<p></p>
        louts, so he made a point of turning his attention to his textbook. Letting his eyes glide<p></p>
        over the course material that he had been discussing with Mahiru earlier, he sighed<p></p>
        softly at the two oafs beside him who had begun a particularly vulgar conversation,<p></p>
        even for high school boys.<p></p>
        "…You know, I really don't think that Shiina is even going to take a second look at you<p></p>
        if you keep going on and on about your urges in public."<p></p>
        Amane figured that most girls probably did not appreciate a guy who participated in<p></p>
        that kind of dirty talk. All the more so if they themselves had full figures.<p></p>
        On top of that, he knew that Mahiru did not appreciate it when someone approached<p></p>
        her just because of her physical appearance. In fact, it was likely to put her off if she<p></p>
        suspected they were only interested in her body.<p></p>
        When Amane glanced over at where Mahiru was sitting, he knew the girls must have<p></p>
        heard them, because Mahiru was patting Chitose's arm, trying to calm her friend's<p></p>
        raging bloodlust.<p></p>
        Itsuki sometimes teased Chitose in private, but that was between the two of them. If<p></p>
        some stranger started casually talking about her body, she had every reason to be<p></p>
        furious.<p></p>
        Mahiru's angelic expression never faltered as she comforted her friend, but Amane got<p></p>
        the feeling that she, too, looked angry somehow.<p></p>
        I didn't say anything, though…<p></p>
        In his mind, Amane offered this explanation to Mahiru, then shut out the conversation<p></p>
        of his two annoying male classmates by focusing on his book.<p></p>
        The pair didn't seem to mind all the dirty looks they were getting, and Amane felt no<p></p>
        obligation to step in. Or more accurately, he had already tried to stop them, and they<p></p>
        were continuing nonetheless.<p></p>
        Amane quietly let out another heavy sigh when the boys started talking about how<p></p>
        great the angel was.<p></p>
        The angel is probably only the angel because guys like you act like that.<p></p>
        He didn't voice the thought. The words just rolled around in his mouth and vanished<p></p>
        without ever coming out.<p></p>
        "…Um, Miss Shiina?"<p></p>
        That evening, Mahiru had gone to Amane's apartment as usual, but she was wearing a<p></p>
        stormy expression. She was acting so differently that he unintentionally called her by<p></p>
        her last name.<p></p>
        "What is it?"<p></p>
        Her reply was curt. She was definitely mad about something.<p></p>
        Seeing the fundamentally gentle and tolerant Mahiru so bothered gave Amane a bit of<p></p>
        a stomachache.<p></p>
        "What's got you in a bad mood?"<p></p>
        "I am not in a bad mood."<p></p>
        "…No, you definitely are."<p></p>
        "Am not."<p></p>
        Mahiru was sitting next to him on the sofa, her expression unchanging. It wasn't exactly<p></p>
        obvious that she was angry—more like she was oozing displeasure. It might have been<p></p>
        more accurate to say that the air around her felt prickly.<p></p>
        Amane struggled to think of what might be aggravating her—then he remembered she<p></p>
        had seen him talking to their classmates earlier that day.<p></p>
        "…Ah, maybe you think I joined in with those guys discussing your figure?"<p></p>
        If Mahiru thought that, he could understand why she would be upset. It probably<p></p>
        wasn't very pleasant to picture the person you were sitting with drooling over your<p></p>
        body.<p></p>
        Mahiru had stiffened at Amane's words, so his conjecture had probably been accurate.<p></p>
        "You overheard us, didn't you?"<p></p>
        "Yeah, well, uh… I heard that part of the conversation, but…"<p></p>
        "Sorry. That must have been awful for you to have to hear."<p></p>
        "No, I, um… I'm used to hearing comments about my appearance, and it's not the first<p></p>
        time someone's remarked directly on my figure, so it was more like 'Oh, I see.'"<p></p>
        Mahiru had been conducting herself as the angel for many years, and her statement<p></p>
        was typical of a girl who never failed to put in the effort to maintain her good looks.<p></p>
        However, from the way Mahiru said it, Amane could tell she'd been the victim of<p></p>
        harassment before, and he felt ashamed to belong to the same gender as anyone who<p></p>
        would be so crude.<p></p>
        "Well, I was appalled they had the nerve to say those things in a place with girls around.<p></p>
        I mean, their preferences are their own business, but if they had to get all worked up<p></p>
        like that, you'd think they'd have the decency to at least do it somewhere in private. I<p></p>
        can't even imagine saying those kinds of things in front of all those people."<p></p>
        "One hundred percent."<p></p>
        The boys should have thought about the time and the place, but they clearly hadn't. It<p></p>
        had been inappropriate for them to have a conversation like that where other people<p></p>
        could hear. Actually, as far as Amane was concerned, it was indecent to talk about that<p></p>
        kind of thing at all.<p></p>
        "I noticed you were bothered by what they said, Amane, and I could hear that you<p></p>
        didn't join in. The other girls were impressed, too."<p></p>
        "Th-thank goodness… You know I wouldn't want to get mixed up with that."<p></p>
        "…If anything, it made me a bit worried. Maybe you focus a little too much on always<p></p>
        being a gentleman… and not enough on remembering that you're a man."<p></p>
        "Isn't that a little harsh?"<p></p>
        He felt irritated that his classmates, and even Mahiru, doubted his manliness.<p></p>
        "It's the truth," she said, turning away. She was still giving off hints that she was a little<p></p>
        upset about something, and when she noticed Amane frowning, she hugged a cushion<p></p>
        to her knees. "…Apparently you don't consider me very attractive, which hurts my<p></p>
        confidence."<p></p>
        "And just what, exactly, brought you to that conclusion?"<p></p>
        "You apparently aren't interested, for one."<p></p>
        She must had heard him say he had no interest in the angel.<p></p>
        "Wait, what I said was that I don't have any interest in the angel. The angel is the<p></p>
        character you play at school, right? What I meant was that even though I'm interested<p></p>
        in Mahiru, I don't have much interest in Mahiru masquerading as the angel. I think it<p></p>
        looks like a tough gig; that's all."<p></p>
        "…So you do find me attractive, then?"<p></p>
        "I'd have to be blind to think otherwise. You're incredibly beautiful. As the person most<p></p>
        often by your side, I can assure you of that."<p></p>
        Amane couldn't imagine how anyone could see it any other way. After spending so<p></p>
        much time with Mahiru, he had gotten to know many different facets of her personality<p></p>
        and had come to regard her with great affection. His love for her only increased and<p></p>
        never diminished. That alone was proof that she was appealing.<p></p>
        As Amane spoke, Mahiru began nervously pinching and tugging at the fabric of the<p></p>
        cushion she was clutching. She couldn't seem to look him in the eye.<p></p>
        "I-if that's true, then it's fine, but…"<p></p>
        Mahiru squirmed and nodded like she was hesitating to say something, then buried<p></p>
        her face in the cushion. Her ears were bright red, poking out from beneath her blond<p></p>
        hair, and it was very obvious she was embarrassed.<p></p>
        When she got like this, he knew the only thing to do was give her some space, so<p></p>
        Amane turned away, leaning against the sofa's armrest.<p></p>
        He knew if he didn't cool off, Mahiru would be sure to see it in his face when she<p></p>
        recovered.<p></p>
        …If it embarrasses her so much, she could just not say anything.<p></p>
        As the two of them both considered their words, Amane let out a sigh too quiet for<p></p>
        Mahiru to hear.<p></p>
        Chapter 32: The Angel in Cooking Class<p></p>
        "I'm looking forward to working with you."<p></p>
        Amane was normally never on the receiving end of Mahiru's angelic smile, so when<p></p>
        she turned it on him, it made him want to groan.<p></p>
        "…Same here," he responded in a quiet voice.<p></p>
        As a rule, Amane never approached Mahiru at school, but he didn't have much choice<p></p>
        if she was the one who approached him. But this time, it wasn't Mahiru's fault; instead,<p></p>
        it was simply because they had decided to team up, as friends.<p></p>
        Their home economics class was going to feature a cooking segment in several days,<p></p>
        and the students had been given the freedom to form their own teams, as well as the<p></p>
        right to choose what dishes they were going to prepare. However, they were required<p></p>
        to put together a menu that applied their lessons about nutrition, and they would be<p></p>
        graded on that menu, so they needed to take it seriously.<p></p>
        There were, of course, many potential suitors hoping to be on the same team as<p></p>
        Mahiru, but she formed a pair with her good friend Chitose, and her partner Chitose<p></p>
        pulled in her boyfriend, Itsuki. Amane, who thought he was paired up with Itsuki,<p></p>
        naturally came along with him, so from the outside it looked like he was with Mahiru.<p></p>
        They were getting even more stares now, and Amane could already feel a stomachache<p></p>
        coming on.<p></p>
        Chitose, the main culprit in a sense, was grinning cheekily as she arranged some nearby<p></p>
        desks for them. "Ah-ha-ha! You look like you swallowed a bug, Amane!" she cackled.<p></p>
        "And whose fault do you think that is?" Amane replied.<p></p>
        Once they had pushed four desks together and taken their seats, Mahiru smiled at him<p></p>
        apologetically, letting her angelic expression slip just a bit. "I'm sorry for intruding,"<p></p>
        she said gracefully.<p></p>
        "No, this isn't your fault," Amane insisted. "I'm just worried about whether I'm going<p></p>
        to be stabbed by those daggers in everyone's eyes."<p></p>
        "It's just like Amane not to appreciate his good fortune," Chitose admonished.<p></p>
        "I just don't wanna hog all the good luck, is all."<p></p>
        It was probably just his imagination, but he thought he heard displeased voices quietly<p></p>
        agreeing. All the other boys must have been clamoring for the chance to eat the angel's<p></p>
        handmade food, and he knew they were angry to see it go to a guy who didn't even<p></p>
        seem to want it that badly. He was being pierced by thorny gazes full of jealousy and<p></p>
        envy.<p></p>
        "But you know I'll have a hard time if you're not with me, man," Itsuki added. "Besides,<p></p>
        all the other teams are groups of friends."<p></p>
        "Hmm…" Amane couldn't argue that point.<p></p>
        He wasn't exactly an outcast or anything, but he certainly wasn't popular or charming<p></p>
        enough to insert himself into another group of friends and expect to get along well. It<p></p>
        would have been difficult for Amane alone to leave his group now that they were<p></p>
        assembled.<p></p>
        "Just give up and accept your fate!" Itsuki insisted. "If you're gonna whine so much,<p></p>
        maybe we never should have been friends in the first place!"<p></p>
        "…I don't regret being your friend."<p></p>
        "Oh, I'm getting all choked up!"<p></p>
        "Ugh, you know, maybe I'm starting to regret it after all," Amane shot back.<p></p>
        Itsuki pressed his hands to his face. "A cruel double cross!" he moaned dramatically,<p></p>
        and then he cackled with cheerful laughter.<p></p>
        Amane was not particularly impressed with his friend's performance. He was just<p></p>
        starting to think about pinching Itsuki's cheeks when he heard a quiet laugh mixed<p></p>
        with a sigh.<p></p>
        Mahiru was smiling in amusement.<p></p>
        "I've thought this before, but you two really are good friends, aren't you? It's enough<p></p>
        to make me jealous."<p></p>
        "…I guess."<p></p>
        Even though she already knew they were good friends, Mahiru was acting as if it was<p></p>
        the first time she had ever mentioned it. Amane felt uncomfortable not being able to<p></p>
        respond.<p></p>
        He was grateful she was keeping up the act, but when Mahiru pretended they were<p></p>
        strangers like this, it also made him feel both embarrassed and frustrated.<p></p>
        Chitose had been listening to their exchange, and with a grin, she patted Mahiru on<p></p>
        the shoulder. "Join in if you like, Mahirun!" she said.<p></p>
        "Hey, stop that," Amane scolded. "Don't try to get Shiina involved in your wild antics.<p></p>
        You're bugging her."<p></p>
        "No, that's not the case at all," Mahiru insisted.<p></p>
        "See?"<p></p>
        "Don't get carried away, Chitose."<p></p>
        Chitose liked the idea of getting Amane and Mahiru together. Actually, she more than<p></p>
        endorsed it—whenever she got the chance to steer the conversation, usually she made<p></p>
        every attempt to push them together. That was fine when they were at Amane's<p></p>
        apartment, but they were currently in school, and he wanted to avoid doing anything<p></p>
        that might draw attention.<p></p>
        "All right, enough with that stuff," Amane declared. "We've got to choose our menu."<p></p>
        They only had a limited time to decide on a menu before they would have to present<p></p>
        their choice, so he insisted on making a quick decision in a bid to show the rest of the<p></p>
        class he didn't hold any particular feelings toward Mahiru.<p></p>
        Chitose looked somewhat dumbfounded. "You can't cook, but you're taking charge?"<p></p>
        "Rude," Amane said, bristling. "I can make… omelets."<p></p>
        "…You might call them omelets, but what you make is basically scrambled eggs," Mahiru<p></p>
        whispered quietly so only the three other people in her group could hear, causing<p></p>
        Itsuki and Chitose to burst into a fit of giggles. Amane, still wary about being in public,<p></p>
        shot Mahiru a slightly reproachful glance, but she wasn't bothered by it at all.<p></p>
        Her expression was too much like her usual angelic smile, and Amane turned away<p></p>
        sharply. Chitose and Itsuki grinned once more at his reaction, which was even more<p></p>
        unbearable.<p></p>
        "How about you, Akazawa?" Mahiru asked. "How is your cooking?"<p></p>
        "Me?… Well, it's good enough to keep me alive," he replied.<p></p>
        "Itsuki can do pretty much anything around the house, you know," Chitose added.<p></p>
        Itsuki, who could somehow manage to do most tasks if he put his mind to it, could also<p></p>
        whip up a flawless meal. Naturally, it wasn't as good as Mahiru's cooking, but it was<p></p>
        plenty good enough to survive.<p></p>
        "It's 'cause my mom's never at home, thanks to work. I even used to go over to Amane's<p></p>
        sometimes to make food for him. Don't do that anymore, though, huh?"<p></p>
        Itsuki glanced over at Amane meaningfully, and Amane frowned, but Itsuki just smiled.<p></p>
        "I suppose that's true."<p></p>
        "…If you guys don't shut up, everybody's gonna find out what a loser I am."<p></p>
        "Too late, bro."<p></p>
        "Bit late, isn't it?"<p></p>
        "You guys are way too in sync."<p></p>
        "Heh-heh. Well, now you don't have to worry about meals; isn't that great?"<p></p>
        "…W-wait, I do make some effort!" Amane protested. "Sometimes I make something<p></p>
        when I'm alone…"<p></p>
        He didn't think it was good to leave everything up to Mahiru, so on the weekends or<p></p>
        when Mahiru wasn't around, he did take a stab at cooking. Of course, he stuck to<p></p>
        simple recipes that could be made in the broiler or using the range.<p></p>
        Amane had gotten quite flustered, when for some reason Mahiru smiled at him<p></p>
        affectionately and commended him. "How admirable."<p></p>
        There was a painful amount of meaning hidden in those words. Amane's cheek<p></p>
        twitched.<p></p>
        She was probably teasing him because she was perfectly aware of how much Amane<p></p>
        struggled when it came to cooking. Compared to Mahiru's cooking, his feeble efforts<p></p>
        were comparable to a child's. She was probably amused by how terrible they were.<p></p>
        But he was steadily making improvements—when he started, he couldn't do anything<p></p>
        for himself—and he needed it to be said.<p></p>
        "Well, how about we decide on a menu for now?" Mahiru suggested. "Our grades<p></p>
        depend on it."<p></p>
        Without making any overt reference to Amane's distressed state, Mahiru, still with a<p></p>
        gentle smile, tapped the menu worksheet they needed to turn in to complete the<p></p>
        assignment.<p></p>
        Mahiru was the best cook among them, so the group had quietly agreed to put Mahiru<p></p>
        in charge. Even though Amane had learned to make a few things, he was still an amateur,<p></p>
        especially when it came to creating a nutritionally balanced menu. So it made sense to<p></p>
        follow Mahiru's lead. After all, she chose the menu for dinner practically every night.<p></p>
        After some discussion, the group decided on a sanshoku soborodon, a dish of minced<p></p>
        meat, eggs, and vegetables served over rice, with miso soup and cellophane noodle<p></p>
        salad on the side, plus almond jelly for dessert. Chitose was grinning from ear to ear<p></p>
        at the menu.<p></p>
        Mahiru had casually included an egg dish, probably because she knew Amane liked<p></p>
        them. That fact did not escape Chitose's and Itsuki's notice, and Amane hid behind his<p></p>
        worksheet to avoid their taunting stares.<p></p>
        And then, on the actual day of the cooking class, Amane let out an exhausted sigh.<p></p>
        He was supposedly working as Mahiru's assistant, but really she was just babysitting<p></p>
        him. He stood near Mahiru and watched her put on her apron, a sight he had grown<p></p>
        accustomed to.<p></p>
        "I'm counting on you for support, okay, Fujimiya?" she said with a smile.<p></p>
        This wasn't any scheme of Chitose's. The group had simply decided that Amane was<p></p>
        the least useful when it came to kitchen work. He even had a prior record—he'd cut<p></p>
        his finger right in front of Mahiru—so they had thought it best not to let him handle<p></p>
        anything too involved.<p></p>
        He could understand their reasoning, as all of them were equally intent on avoiding<p></p>
        any bloodshed, and because they wanted to do their work quickly, since the students<p></p>
        would be dismissed to lunch starting with the finished teams, so he didn't argue.<p></p>
        However, he did still take the time to insist, rather loudly, that he "…wasn't exactly<p></p>
        totally incapable."<p></p>
        "…Are you sulking?" Mahiru asked him stealthily once she'd finished preparing the<p></p>
        vegetables.<p></p>
        As he was measuring out the seasonings, without looking at her, Amane replied, "No,<p></p>
        of course not. I just feel like I'm being unfairly judged."<p></p>
        "No one's judging you. It's just, well… um, you can't deny that the rest of us are more<p></p>
        efficient."<p></p>
        "I certainly can't."<p></p>
        It went without saying that Mahiru could cook, and Amane had eaten Itsuki's cooking<p></p>
        before, so he knew Itsuki could handle himself in the kitchen just fine, and as long as<p></p>
        Chitose didn't do anything crazy with the seasonings, she could be expected to perform<p></p>
        reasonably well. Amane wasn't entirely helpless, but he was objectively less capable<p></p>
        than the three of them, so he couldn't really shoot back if they teased him on that point.<p></p>
        "And so I think it's best to get you to work in your area of strength. Also, Chitose's liable<p></p>
        to get carried away with the seasonings, so I think we'd better leave that up to you,<p></p>
        Fujimiya… It's an important job, you know."<p></p>
        "That's a serious responsibility… is what I thought at first, but I just have to follow the<p></p>
        recipe, right?"<p></p>
        "Preventing a Chitose surprise before it happens is also a crucial job."<p></p>
        Mahiru let a giggle slip out, and Amane glanced over at Chitose.<p></p>
        She was simmering rice in a pot while cleaning up after she and Itsuki had prepared<p></p>
        the almond jelly and placed it in the refrigerator. There probably weren't any pranks<p></p>
        in the jelly.<p></p>
        Chitose didn't have an unsophisticated palate, but she did strangely enjoy extreme<p></p>
        flavors and surprises, so Itsuki had been tasked with supervising her to guard against<p></p>
        any of that. Plus, this way she could work alongside her boyfriend.<p></p>
        Laughing quietly, Mahiru pulled out the bean sprouts and carrots that had finished<p></p>
        simmering in their basket, so Amane pulled off two or three sheets of paper towel<p></p>
        from the roll sitting on the counter.<p></p>
        "Fujimiya?"<p></p>
        "Yeah, got it."<p></p>
        Mahiru handed him the boiled vegetables in their basket, so Amane chilled them<p></p>
        slightly and used the paper towels to sponge off some of the moisture, then threw<p></p>
        them into the bowl of seasonings he had prepared in advance, along with the rinsed<p></p>
        cellophane noodles and julienned cucumber and ham.<p></p>
        Recalling Mahiru's welcome words that cooking wasn't such a difficult thing as long<p></p>
        as you measured correctly and paid attention to the instructions, Amane performed<p></p>
        his tasks according to the recipe. The chef had left him with the simplest jobs, so there<p></p>
        wasn't exactly a ton to be proud of, though.<p></p>
        "After I stir in the sesame seeds, I can put this in the refrigerator, right?" he asked.<p></p>
        "That's right, and then…"<p></p>
        "Put the noodles in and take the minced meat out."<p></p>
        The simmering rice was almost ready, so he figured she was planning to get the bowls<p></p>
        out before too long.<p></p>
        Mahiru watched as he covered the bowl containing the noodle salad with plastic wrap<p></p>
        and wrote their team number on it. Apparently, he'd done it right, as she started to<p></p>
        ready the frying pan without making any corrections.<p></p>
        The vegetables for the miso soup were already done cooking, and they just needed to<p></p>
        dissolve the miso paste. Chitose and Itsuki had put the almond jelly in the refrigerator<p></p>
        to chill and congeal, so all that was left was to get the rice bowls ready.<p></p>
        Taking care not to bump anyone on the way, Amane exchanged minced meat for<p></p>
        noodle salad in the fridge and returned to their station.<p></p>
        As he was walking back to his own group's station, he took a sidelong glance at the<p></p>
        other teams. Some were doing all right, while others were bickering. One of the teams<p></p>
        made up of all boys was playing around and wasting ingredients, and the teacher who<p></p>
        was overseeing this exercise in student autonomy was glaring sharply at them.<p></p>
        …Seeing that makes me glad I have Mahiru with me.<p></p>
        The fact that Amane's team had been able to do their work more smoothly than other<p></p>
        teams was thanks to Mahiru's great familiarity with the cooking process and also<p></p>
        because they'd chosen a menu that wasn't too demanding.<p></p>
        "Rather than showing off with some complicated menu, it'll be easier to make a meal<p></p>
        that's nutritious and doesn't take too much time. Food is something you have to make<p></p>
        every day, so you shouldn't fixate on things that tire you out, right?"<p></p>
        Amane had asked her at home about her reasoning for the menu, and that's how she<p></p>
        had answered. He thought it was a rational way of thinking, typical of Mahiru, who<p></p>
        made dinner for the two of them every night.<p></p>
        From Amane's perspective, even this simple menu took plenty of work to get right, so<p></p>
        this cooking class was bringing him a renewed appreciation of Mahiru's worth.<p></p>
        Musing seriously to himself that the people in charge of the kitchens of the world must<p></p>
        have a hard time making every meal, he returned to their counter, where Mahiru was<p></p>
        giving Chitose instructions. Itsuki was nowhere to be seen, but Mahiru must have<p></p>
        understood his unspoken question from the look in his eyes, because she promptly<p></p>
        informed him, "I asked Akazawa to go fetch the dishes from the other room." She<p></p>
        continued, "All right then, I'm entrusting the meat to you."<p></p>
        "Got it," Amane replied. "Cook it until the juice dries up, right?"<p></p>
        "That's right. Thanks."<p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to be working on the yellow and green portions of the tricolor rice<p></p>
        bowl. She boiled water to parboil the spinach as she cracked and scrambled the eggs.<p></p>
        Mahiru had finished preparing the frying pan for use, leaving Amane with only the<p></p>
        simple task of heating the mixture of meat and seasonings.<p></p>
        As she used a cloth to dry the pot she had used and washed, Chitose watched him<p></p>
        frying the meat with a strange look in her eye. "…I thought you couldn't cook?"<p></p>
        "I keep telling you, I'm not completely helpless. I just look bad next to her; that's all."<p></p>
        The job he'd been assigned was to simmer the meat and seasonings, stirring the<p></p>
        mixture with a wooden spatula until the moisture was evaporated. He was offended<p></p>
        that she assumed he couldn't even manage this much. It wasn't like they were comic<p></p>
        book characters cooking up dark matter here.<p></p>
        Amane figured that most recipes got messed up when the cook used too much heat,<p></p>
        timed things poorly, or added too many ingredients. But they had Mahiru to guide<p></p>
        them, so they practically could not fail.<p></p>
        "If you must know, I memorized the recipe so I wouldn't get in the way."<p></p>
        "How thoughtful of you, Amane."<p></p>
        "Well, if I didn't pull my weight, the other guys would kill me."<p></p>
        He could feel them trying to stare daggers through him and could almost hear their<p></p>
        thoughts (…Is he gonna enjoy the angel's hand-cooked meal without working for it…?)<p></p>
        So he was trying to do something, at least.<p></p>
        Amane was fully aware that he was not naturally gifted at cooking, so he had studied<p></p>
        the recipe even more seriously than he would a textbook, but Mahiru had laughed at<p></p>
        him. "You don't have to take it that seriously," she had said at home, but he knew he<p></p>
        ought to be ready just in case.<p></p>
        Amane checked that the meat was browning and had started giving off a salty-sweet<p></p>
        aroma, and he stirred it appropriately with the wooden spatula so it wouldn't burn.<p></p>
        Beside him, Mahiru was using the other burner to cook scrambled eggs. Amane felt a<p></p>
        little embarrassed that she was making more than the usual amount because she<p></p>
        knew how much he loved eggs, but he was also happy she was thinking of him.<p></p>
        "Shiina, do I let this go a little longer?" he asked.<p></p>
        "That's right," Mahiru answered. "You should let it boil down a little bit more. But it'll<p></p>
        get dry if you simmer it too long, so please take it off the heat in about one minute."<p></p>
        "Mm, got it." He nodded.<p></p>
        Most of the moisture had already been cooked off, so he stirred the mixture with his<p></p>
        spatula to keep it from burning while Mahiru went back to her own work without<p></p>
        saying anything further.<p></p>
        Chitose was watching Amane and Mahiru from the side, and she shrugged, looking<p></p>
        slightly amazed. "…You know, the two of you seem, well, what can I say…? It's like<p></p>
        you're newlyw—"<p></p>
        "Chitose, please mind the miso soup."<p></p>
        "Eeep, yes, ma'am!"<p></p>
        Chitose let out an idiotic shriek for some reason and went to take the miso soup out<p></p>
        of the refrigerator.<p></p>
        Amane quickly looked over to Mahiru. "…Did something happen?"<p></p>
        "Nothing at all."<p></p>
        It didn't seem like nothing at all, but Mahiru didn't seem likely to tell him more, so he<p></p>
        gave up on getting any more information out of her and turned off the burner he had<p></p>
        been using to fry the meat.<p></p>
        By the time Mahiru had finished cooking the eggs and sliced and dressed the parboiled<p></p>
        spinach with seasonings, Itsuki had returned with the dishes.<p></p>
        "Aren't you a bit late?"<p></p>
        "Yeah, sorry. Some folks from the other teams came to talk to me."<p></p>
        Itsuki smiled flippantly, but his face didn't really look like he was joking around. He<p></p>
        wasn't the type to skip out on something like this, so he probably had actually gotten<p></p>
        held up talking to someone and couldn't extract himself right away.<p></p>
        It wasn't clear who he had spoken with or what they had talked about, but Amane got<p></p>
        the sense that it had something to do with Mahiru. Without her nearby, their jealous<p></p>
        classmates could speak freely, so they had probably directed their complaints at Itsuki<p></p>
        in Amane's stead. Of course, this was all conjecture; he didn't really know.<p></p>
        "Well, at any rate, I did my job, so…" Itsuki pointed to a tray bearing the right number<p></p>
        of plates and bowls.<p></p>
        Mahiru smiled gently at him. "Everything's ready. Let's arrange it and take a photo for<p></p>
        our report, then help ourselves, shall we?"<p></p>
        "Hell yeah!" Itsuki cheered. "I'm starving."<p></p>
        "That's 'cause you skipped breakfast, isn't it?" Chitose remarked.<p></p>
        "Not my fault; I overslept. Can I have an extra-big portion?"<p></p>
        "I don't mind," Mahiru replied. "I'm going to get the noodle salad now, so please<p></p>
        arrange things in the meanwhile."<p></p>
        Amane quickly spoke up. "I'll go with you, then. We've got to put the almond jelly with<p></p>
        everything else for the photo."<p></p>
        Amane said he would help, figuring Mahiru wouldn't have enough hands to carry the<p></p>
        dessert as well, and she nodded at him with her calm smile.<p></p>
        A little too late, he realized he should have sent Chitose, mostly to get it done without<p></p>
        inviting unnecessary speculation, but there was no going back now. Amane deliberately<p></p>
        kept a little distance between them as they headed for the refrigerator in the rear of<p></p>
        the kitchen classroom.<p></p>
        None of the other teams had Mahiru in their corner, so most of them weren't finished<p></p>
        yet. As usual, a few groups were only half-heartedly working through the exercise.<p></p>
        Amane thought it looked like they were going to get awful grades as he walked past<p></p>
        them indifferently.<p></p>
        There was even a team of boys who were chatting and fooling around instead of<p></p>
        cooking. One of them held his frying pan in one hand and laughed as he leaned away<p></p>
        from the table with an exaggerated movement—right into the path of a girl carrying a<p></p>
        pot full of soup.<p></p>
        In that instant, Amane sensed impending disaster and pulled Mahiru out of the way.<p></p>
        A few seconds later, he heard a loud splash followed by the faint, permeating smell of<p></p>
        milk as hot steam whirled around him.<p></p>
        The girl must have been making a cream soup, given the half a cup or so of thick white<p></p>
        liquid that was currently spreading across the floor. He peeled his eyes away to<p></p>
        confirm that none had splashed on Mahiru.<p></p>
        "Shiina, are you burned?"<p></p>
        "…Ah, no, it didn't hit me, but…"<p></p>
        Mahiru looked frozen with surprise.<p></p>
        The girl who had spilled her soup looked apologetic, and the face of the boy with the<p></p>
        frying pan who had bumped into her was ghastly pale.<p></p>
        "Did any of it hit you?" Amane asked the girl with the soup.<p></p>
        "Ah, n-no, I'm all right. S-sorry…!"<p></p>
        "It's okay. None of it hit me or Shiina, either."<p></p>
        Luckily, he had been quick to notice the danger, and neither Mahiru nor Amane was<p></p>
        injured.<p></p>
        He was quick to wave his hand and reassure his female classmate, who had set the pot<p></p>
        on a burner for the time being to apologize, while shooting a glance over at the boy<p></p>
        who had collided with her.<p></p>
        As one would expect, the other boys who had been joking around with him kept their<p></p>
        mouths shut, maybe because they felt guilty. They were looking practically everywhere<p></p>
        except in Mahiru's direction.<p></p>
        "…Look, guys, it's fine to live it up a little, but you can't mess around in a place with fire<p></p>
        and knives and stuff," Amane said. "If someone got hurt and it left a permanent mark,<p></p>
        you'd never forgive yourselves. Thank goodness nothing happened this time, but what<p></p>
        would you have done if you'd hurt one of the girls? Could you take responsibility for<p></p>
        that?"<p></p>
        It would be no laughing matter if someone got burned—or cut with a knife—and came<p></p>
        away from the incident with a scar. Amane wouldn't mind if he got hurt a little bit, but<p></p>
        it would be a serious problem if he injured another person, especially a girl.<p></p>
        Many girls, and even a lot of guys, would be pretty upset if they were left with a nasty<p></p>
        injury. And if someone got seriously hurt in a stupid accident like this, it wouldn't be<p></p>
        strange if they held a grudge.<p></p>
        Whether the wounded party was Mahiru or the other girl didn't matter. Someone<p></p>
        acting irresponsibly in a way that could cause injury to another person made Amane<p></p>
        angry, and he felt compelled to speak up.<p></p>
        Amane was usually very quiet and mostly kept to himself, so when the guilty boy, who<p></p>
        looked like he didn't expect to be told off, saw his narrowed eyes and heard his sharp<p></p>
        tone, he quickly tendered a disheartened apology.<p></p>
        "S-sorry…"<p></p>
        Realizing that if he spoke too forcefully, he was likely to cause a fight, Amane switched<p></p>
        to a more mellow tone of voice. "You don't need to apologize to me, but you'd better<p></p>
        apologize to Yamazaki, who you ran into, and to Shiina, who nearly got splashed.<p></p>
        Anyway, be more careful next time. The kitchen can be a dangerous place."<p></p>
        Then he looked at Mahiru.<p></p>
        He'd had one arm wrapped around her the entire time, and Mahiru's face had gone<p></p>
        slightly red. Though he felt some regret over touching her like that, it was too late to<p></p>
        worry about that now, so he gently released her and, taking care not to make any<p></p>
        strange faces, pointed toward the refrigerator.<p></p>
        "Shiina, I'm sorry for touching you without your permission. Please, go ahead and take<p></p>
        the salad over to our team. I'm going to help wipe up here."<p></p>
        "I-it's all right; I might have gotten jostled, but I'm the one who spilled everything,"<p></p>
        Yamazaki, the girl with the soup, stammered.<p></p>
        "Well anyway, I was involved, too, and all my team has left to do now is eat. It won't<p></p>
        take long, so don't worry about it."<p></p>
        She had only spilled a little bit, so cleaning it up wouldn't take that much time.<p></p>
        After reassuring his distressed classmate, Amane got the teacher's permission and<p></p>
        pulled off several sheets of paper towel from the roll on the counter and mopped up<p></p>
        the soup.<p></p>
        The small amount of liquid was quickly absorbed by the handful of towels. Right as<p></p>
        Amane was thinking that all he needed to do now was wipe it down with a wet towel,<p></p>
        Mahiru appeared from somewhere with a damp cloth in hand and did just that.<p></p>
        "It'll go faster if we work together," she murmured. Then she gave Amane an angelic<p></p>
        smile from up close, which was deeply unsettling for some reason.<p></p>
        "Welcome back!"<p></p>
        After they finished cleaning up, Amane and Mahiru returned to their table carrying<p></p>
        the noodle salad and almond jelly about five minutes later than expected, and Chitose<p></p>
        greeted them with an impish grin.<p></p>
        Amane's and Mahiru's portions, minus the salad and jelly, were already laid out on the<p></p>
        table, so Amane divided everyone's share of cellophane noodle salad into the salad<p></p>
        dishes and let out a sigh.<p></p>
        "I'm so tired…," Amane groaned.<p></p>
        "You looked pretty cool back there, man," Itsuki remarked. "And bold, for once."<p></p>
        "It's not like I was trying to cop a feel or anything," Amane insisted. "I had to get her<p></p>
        out of the way of the soup, that's all."<p></p>
        He hadn't set out to embrace the angel or anything. And even though no one had<p></p>
        criticized his split-second decision, several other boys did give him jealous looks that<p></p>
        made him uncomfortable.<p></p>
        As for Mahiru, she frowned at him just the slightest bit when she heard what he said.<p></p>
        Only someone who knew her well would have noticed this.<p></p>
        "Well, I feel like you really saved me. Thank you for holding me."<p></p>
        "I only did it because your apron or uniform might have gotten dirty, or even worse,<p></p>
        you might have been burned. That guy seemed sorry, too, so that's good."<p></p>
        As one would expect, the boy who had caused the collision received all the blame. After<p></p>
        all, they were in a place where a single misstep might result in a serious accident. At<p></p>
        the moment, the boy in question was getting a serious tongue lashing from their<p></p>
        teacher.<p></p>
        Amane was satisfied since ultimately no one had been hurt. And he hadn't been put at<p></p>
        risk, either. Yes, he had touched Mahiru where everyone could see, which could have<p></p>
        turned out worse than getting burned by hot soup. But judging by the atmosphere<p></p>
        around the classroom, he seemed to have been forgiven for that slipup.<p></p>
        "So if you can be that brave in the face of danger," Itsuki remarked, "then why are you<p></p>
        usually such a weenie?"<p></p>
        "I'm sorry, did you say something?" It was clear from the look in Amane's eyes and the<p></p>
        tone of his voice that he was not interested in hearing whatever rude thing his friend<p></p>
        was planning to say.<p></p>
        "Nothing at all," Itsuki grinned. "At any rate, we finished making our lunch without<p></p>
        incident, so let's take that photo, yeah?" He quickly occupied himself by fiddling with<p></p>
        the camera on his phone.<p></p>
        The students needed to check recipes and send in their photographs, so they were<p></p>
        being allowed to use their phones in class, but not for playing around. Itsuki was<p></p>
        obviously pointing his camera lens at people and not food, so Amane gave him an<p></p>
        exasperated look, but Chitose excitedly pushed her way into the camera's view.<p></p>
        "You too, Mahirun!" she urged. "Get in, get in."<p></p>
        "You guys…," Amane groaned.<p></p>
        Mahiru blinked dramatically, then drew her seat over slightly closer to Amane's with<p></p>
        a little smile.<p></p>
        Et tu, Mahiru…? Amane thought. He was surprised to see her flash him a quick, impish 3<p></p>
        little grin, just for a second, before she donned her angelic smile again.<p></p>
        "Come on, you too, Itsuki," Chitose insisted.<p></p>
        "Wait, but who will take the…? Oh, perfect timing, Yuuta! Come take this picture."<p></p>
        "Huh, what's this all of a sudden?"<p></p>
        Yuuta just happened to be passing by, probably on his way back from the refrigerator,<p></p>
        carrying a tray of thinly sliced pork. Itsuki pressed his smartphone into Yuuta's hand,<p></p>
        then circled around behind Amane and flashed a peace sign.<p></p>
        Yuuta looked surprised by the sudden request, but when he saw the completed dishes<p></p>
        lined up in front of Amane, he seemed to understand.<p></p>
        With a laugh, he said "Guess I've got no choice" and readied the smartphone. "You guys<p></p>
        sure finished fast, huh? Okay, I'm taking it."<p></p>
        "That's 'cause we got hustle, man!"<p></p>
        "But you hardly did anything, Itsuki," Chitose ribbed.<p></p>
        "C'mon, don't say that; you promised!"<p></p>
        Amane laughed at his friend's ridiculous protests. Then he heard the sound of the<p></p>
        camera shutter. He froze—Yuuta had taken the picture before he'd had time to compose<p></p>
        himself.<p></p>
        "That's a good picture!" Yuuta said, before handing Itsuki his smartphone and leaving.<p></p>
        "Wow, it's not every day I get a picture with Amane smiling," Itsuki remarked.<p></p>
        "That's 'cause he usually has a sour face on, right?" Chitose said. "Send the picture to<p></p>
        me, too, please!"<p></p>
        "Hoh-kay. Shiina, you get it from Chitose, okay?"<p></p>
        Mahiru had already exchanged contact information with Itsuki, but in this situation,<p></p>
        with people all around them, it was probably best not to say that out loud.<p></p>
        More importantly, it bothered Amane that Itsuki was sending the photo to Mahiru<p></p>
        before letting him check it.<p></p>
        He shot a look over at Mahiru and got an adorable, albeit restrained, smile in response,<p></p>
        so Amane could do nothing but groan and watch them quickly share the photo.<p></p>
        "…No one cares what my face looks like, so we might as well eat," Amane muttered,<p></p>
        hoping to end the conversation there.<p></p>
        Itsuki gave him a big grin, so before his friend could return to his own seat, Amane<p></p>
        poked him and turned away in a huff.<p></p>
        After that, Amane stuffed his face with the contents of the rice bowl Itsuki and Chitose<p></p>
        had thoughtfully served up with heaps of egg, and he quickly forgot the shame of being<p></p>
        photographed with a big grin. Mahiru just wore a happy smile, not paying Itsuki or<p></p>
        Chitose any attention.<p></p>
        "Aaamaaaneee, starting today we're eating lunch with you, too!"<p></p>
        One day, several days after the cooking class, Chitose bounded over wearing a beaming<p></p>
        smile, dragging Mahiru along behind her. Amane's cheek twitched.<p></p>
        He and Mahiru were acting less like acquaintances and more like regular friends around<p></p>
        each other. They'd even begun chatting together in public. But Amane wondered if<p></p>
        eating together might be moving too quickly.<p></p>
        Sure, if Chitose gave the pretense of coming over to eat with Itsuki, and Mahiru came<p></p>
        with her, they could probably live under the assumption that Chitose had simply<p></p>
        brought a friend. Their classmates shouldn't find that too enviable or suspicious,<p></p>
        Amane thought.<p></p>
        Allowing herself to be pulled along by Chitose, Mahiru wore a gentle smile, conducting<p></p>
        herself as she always did—like an angel.<p></p>
        But Amane was very troubled because he could also see something a little mischievous<p></p>
        in her expression. "Ah, maybe I should move over?" he asked.<p></p>
        Chitose was obviously not going to let him get away that easily. "Don't worry about it!<p></p>
        We're the ones who decided to join your table, after all."<p></p>
        Amane couldn't help feeling like this was Chitose's idea. But even when he glared at<p></p>
        the smiling—no, grinning—Chitose, she didn't seem at all bothered.<p></p>
        She must have planned this with Itsuki, or maybe he was just happy to be eating with<p></p>
        his girlfriend, because Itsuki gave his usual smile and said, "Great idea; let's all eat<p></p>
        together."<p></p>
        Amane withered under the expected stares of jealousy from all around them.<p></p>
        "Oh, are Shirakawa and Shiina eating with us, too?" Yuuta asked as he stepped up to<p></p>
        the table, looking like he intended to join them.<p></p>
        Amane's stomach started to ache.<p></p>
        "Yes, we were planning to sit with them today," Mahiru said.<p></p>
        "Really, now?!" Yuuta smiled. "Well, we should have a rather lively lunch, then!"<p></p>
        Amane was feeling anything but lively.<p></p>
        He wasn't upset with Yuuta.<p></p>
        He was just in complete shock that Mahiru had come over.<p></p>
        I'm so screwed.<p></p>
        "…Just give in, Amane; we've got you surrounded," Itsuki mumbled quietly enough that<p></p>
        Yuuta couldn't hear, and Amane let out a huge, exhausted sigh.<p></p>
        "Do you usually bring your lunch to school, Shiina?" Yuuta asked, indicating the open<p></p>
        lunch box in front of Mahiru.<p></p>
        Amane and Itsuki always ate lunch in the cafeteria, so Mahiru and the others, who<p></p>
        usually ate in the classroom, had joined them.<p></p>
        Once each of the boys had returned to their seats carrying the lunches they had<p></p>
        ordered, Yuuta became curious about Mahiru's lunch box.<p></p>
        Incidentally, Mahiru was sitting straight across from Amane. Chitose had encouraged<p></p>
        her to take that seat, and there hadn't been an opening for Amane to escape.<p></p>
        "Yes, but usually it's just full of leftovers from dinner."<p></p>
        On weeknights, Mahiru often cooked things that would pack well into a lunch box,<p></p>
        separating the leftovers into one portion for Amane's breakfast and one portion for<p></p>
        her own lunch, so that was what she had packed today as well. He could see that the<p></p>
        box contained the teriyaki chicken meatballs they had eaten yesterday.<p></p>
        "Wow, a homemade meal?"<p></p>
        "Yes. But really, it's nothing special."<p></p>
        "Mahirun, it's not nice to lie!" Chitose interrupted. "You're super talented at cooking."<p></p>
        "How about apprenticing with Shiina?" Itsuki added.<p></p>
        Chitose pouted. "Itsuki, you're so mean!"<p></p>
        "You just need to get her to teach you how to season things. You can cook the dishes<p></p>
        themselves, but… your seasonings are strange."<p></p>
        As she clearly demonstrated during the cooking class the other day, Chitose was<p></p>
        actually a fairly accomplished cook. It was just that her desire to cause mischief often<p></p>
        led her to experiment with unorthodox flavors. Itsuki often complained that everything<p></p>
        would be fine, if she just didn't have that bad habit.<p></p>
        "Okay, I'll get Mahirun to start a one-on-one cooking class. We'll get Amane to be the<p></p>
        taste tester."<p></p>
        "I don't think so," Amane replied. "Besides, that'll make a lot of trouble for Shiina. Don't<p></p>
        be so quick to say stuff like that."<p></p>
        "Actually, I don't think it'll be any trouble at all," Mahiru said. "I think I'd enjoy cooking<p></p>
        with Chitose again."<p></p>
        "Yay! Mahirun, I love you! It'll be so much fun! Leave your calendar open, Amane!"<p></p>
        Chitose was sitting beside Mahiru, clinging tightly to her with a wide smile.<p></p>
        Mahiru was smiling, too, as she nodded in agreement. Amane felt deeply moved to<p></p>
        realize they had become very close friends.<p></p>
        Chitose just set up a date with Mahiru, right here in front of everyone, just like that.<p></p>
        Whether it was part of a larger plot, he couldn't say. But when he looked at Chitose, he<p></p>
        could see that she and Mahiru were smiling pleasantly at each other.<p></p>
        Amane's face twitched as he noticed all their nearby classmates had their ears pricked<p></p>
        up, emanating waves of unvoiced jealousy.<p></p>
        "…Hey, Itsuki?" Amane asked.<p></p>
        "Hmm?"<p></p>
        "You think I have any chance of surviving this?"<p></p>
        "Eh, you'll be fine… probably."<p></p>
        He was getting dirty looks from Mahiru's fans, aka the boys who were madly in love<p></p>
        with her. It wasn't just his imagination. This had clearly been Chitose's suggestion, so<p></p>
        they weren't directing the full brunt of their bloodlust at him just yet, but he feared<p></p>
        what might happen the next time Mahiru suggested something, especially once it<p></p>
        became more obvious that they were good friends.<p></p>
        Yuuta leaned over. "That sounds like fun, huh, Fujimiya?"<p></p>
        "…If I were you, I could probably get through this without people being so jealous."<p></p>
        If Amane was attractive and talented like Yuuta, then people would see him and<p></p>
        Mahiru as equals, and even if they were jealous, they'd think there was little to be done<p></p>
        about it and simply give up.<p></p>
        "But I'm also jealous of you, Fujimiya."<p></p>
        "Jealous of what?"<p></p>
        "All sorts of stuff," Yuuta said cryptically. Then he laughed.<p></p>
        Amane couldn't do anything but tilt his head in puzzlement.<p></p>
        Itsuki chimed in, "Now, hold on a minute. There may be something to what Yuuta's<p></p>
        saying."<p></p>
        "Seriously?"<p></p>
        "It's hard for people to recognize what they have. And those who have it can't<p></p>
        understand the feelings of those who don't. On top of that, we all want what we don't<p></p>
        have. Chi's definitely always whining about what she hasn't got."<p></p>
        "Meaning what?"<p></p>
        "Well, what's one thing that Mahiru has plenty of but Chi doesn't have…?"<p></p>
        "You're definitely thinking something perverted right now, aren't you?" Chitose<p></p>
        interrupted. Apparently, she had been listening to their conversation, and even though<p></p>
        she was wearing a broad grin, her eyes were not smiling.<p></p>
        Realizing that this topic was a proverbial land mine, Amane shut his mouth and<p></p>
        watched as Chitose and Itsuki started bantering back and forth. Then he glanced over<p></p>
        at Mahiru. She looked perplexed at Chitose and Itsuki's exchange, but when she met<p></p>
        Amane's eyes, her expression changed into a smile.<p></p>
        It wasn't her angelic smile, but something closer to the happy yet bashful expression<p></p>
        she let him see at home, so Amane got flustered and quickly averted his eyes.<p></p>
        "Were you surprised?"<p></p>
        At home, Mahiru was grinning impishly.<p></p>
        Amane couldn't help but give her a wry smile back. "Surprised? I mean, I did think you<p></p>
        came on pretty strong."<p></p>
        "I know I said I was going to take it slow, but I thought it was about time to go to the<p></p>
        next step. I've also recently realized we won't make any progress if I don't push you a<p></p>
        little bit."<p></p>
        "That's true."<p></p>
        She had probably been extra proactive because she knew Amane was constantly ready<p></p>
        to flee, but in that setting, he had been surrounded and couldn't get away easily.<p></p>
        Amane had been startled because he hadn't expected Mahiru to be that pushy, but they<p></p>
        had simply talked. She hadn't tried to touch him or anything, so his mind was at ease.<p></p>
        If she had touched him innocently and casually like she did at home, he had no doubt<p></p>
        that deadly blades of jealousy would have closed in on him for the kill. He depended<p></p>
        on her, and she trusted him more than anyone else, but their classmates had no idea<p></p>
        about any of that.<p></p>
        "I'm trying my best to take things bit by bit, so that it doesn't shake up your routine<p></p>
        too much. But Amane, if something bothers you, please tell me, okay?"<p></p>
        Mahiru was perfectly aware of her popularity. Amane knew she was taking great pains<p></p>
        not to become too friendly with him too quickly, all so their classmates wouldn't get<p></p>
        jealous. Typical Mahiru—her first concern was protecting him.<p></p>
        Still, he couldn't deny that, this time, he felt like Chitose had gone a little too far. It was<p></p>
        too late to do anything about it now, though, so he would just have to be more cautious<p></p>
        moving forward.<p></p>
        "Well, it's okay for the time being…," Amane said. "Though, I do get jealous looks."<p></p>
        "Oh really? That's… Don't you hate that…?"<p></p>
        Apparently, she was still concerned about the fact that Amane had been sullen at first.<p></p>
        "But now I understand you were lonely. We were wrong to leave a friend out, and it<p></p>
        was obviously hard on you."<p></p>
        "…A friend, huh?" 1<p></p>
        "Hmm?"<p></p>
        "No, nothing."<p></p>
        It definitely seemed like something was bothering her, but Mahiru didn't appear<p></p>
        inclined to talk about it. When she turned away, Amane realized he must have done<p></p>
        something to dampen her high spirits.<p></p>
        He went right ahead and stroked her hair.<p></p>
        "…You aren't thinking you can solve everything just by patting my head a couple times,<p></p>
        right?"<p></p>
        "I don't, but I thought it might make you happy."<p></p>
        "Well, it does, but… please don't do it to just any girl when you're trying to smooth<p></p>
        things over."<p></p>
        "I don't do it to anyone but you, Mahiru…" 2<p></p>
        To begin with, the only other girl I'm friends with is Chitose. And there's no way I'm doing<p></p>
        this with her. Besides, I don't think it would make her very happy. No, Mahiru's the only<p></p>
        person I'd ever do this with—and the only person I'd ever want to. She's the only one I<p></p>
        want to pamper.<p></p>
        Amane thought he had made it clear that he was being serious. But Mahiru still looked<p></p>
        upset, and she pounded her fist into one of the cushions.<p></p>
        Amane started drawing his hand back and was surprised when she head-butted him<p></p>
        in the upper arm. It didn't hurt, but he was still shocked by how Mahiru had become<p></p>
        noticeably more aggressive lately.<p></p>
        "…Amane, you dummy."<p></p>
        "Why do you say that?"<p></p>
        "Just how hard do I have to try…?" 2<p></p>
        "I—I don't really understand what you're saying, but you'll wear yourself out if you try<p></p>
        anything too hard, so you should probably take it easy…"<p></p>
        "If I don't prod you along, we'll never get anywhere."<p></p>
        Mahiru looked a bit resentful as he peeked over the top of his shoulder, and yet he<p></p>
        thought he could see embarrassment and a touch of anticipation in her shimmering<p></p>
        eyes.<p></p>
        Amane couldn't bring himself to meet her gaze. "It r-really seems like you want<p></p>
        something from me."<p></p>
        "…I just want what happens next…"<p></p>
        Next—?<p></p>
        Mahiru must have wanted something further from Amane, but at the moment, she<p></p>
        didn't seem to be making any additional requests, so for the time being, Amane<p></p>
        decided to continue stroking her head gently and made every effort to please her.<p></p>
        Chapter 33: The Angel’s Proposal<p></p>
        "Golden Week's pretty soon, huh?" Amane muttered quietly, gazing at the calendar on<p></p>
        the shelf.<p></p>
        April had been a busy month, and he had been preoccupied with moving up a grade<p></p>
        and Mahiru's big push to be friendly with him even at school. So before he knew it, the<p></p>
        end of the month was fast approaching, and Golden Week, highly anticipated by<p></p>
        students and adults alike, would soon be upon them.<p></p>
        Amane didn't particularly dislike his studies. Actually, if asked, he would say he enjoyed<p></p>
        them. Going to school was a little bit of a hassle but not any great hardship, so he<p></p>
        wasn't necessarily all that thrilled about the break. He simply thought it would be nice<p></p>
        to have some more time to relax.<p></p>
        Unlike last year, this year Mahiru would be with him for Golden Week, so he wouldn't<p></p>
        be bored.<p></p>
        Chitose had already claimed one of the days of his break for "taste testing at Mahiru's<p></p>
        cooking class," so far from boring, his vacation promised to be eventful and probably<p></p>
        difficult.<p></p>
        "Another long break is coming up…," Mahiru muttered.<p></p>
        "Yep, but is it me or do you not sound too thrilled?"<p></p>
        "It's not that I don't like breaks. I was just wondering how I'll kill the time."<p></p>
        Apparently Mahiru felt similarity. Both of them were homebodies, and they hadn't<p></p>
        made any plans to speak of.<p></p>
        "Yeah, I mean, I'm happy enough to get a break, but I don't really have anything to do."<p></p>
        Amane hadn't fallen behind in his schoolwork or anything, so he didn't feel like he<p></p>
        needed to go out of his way to pack his vacation with studying.<p></p>
        He didn't have an especially strong desire to partake in his hobbies of walking or<p></p>
        reading, and it wasn't like he needed to make plans for those anyway. Same with video<p></p>
        games. He really didn't have any plans.<p></p>
        "…Amane, are you free over the break?"<p></p>
        "I guess I am."<p></p>
        As things stood, all he had planned were his day as a taste tester for the impromptu<p></p>
        cooking class and going to karaoke at some point with Itsuki and Yuuta. The break was<p></p>
        a whole week long, so his schedule was still wide open.<p></p>
        He was about to say he'd most likely be relaxing at home, when he noticed Mahiru<p></p>
        staring up at him.<p></p>
        "What's the matter?"<p></p>
        He met Mahiru's gaze and saw that she looked like she had something to say. She<p></p>
        reached for her smartphone, which was on top of the table.<p></p>
        More accurately, she reached for the phone case.<p></p>
        Mahiru's phone case was the wallet type with spots to keep cards and such, and from<p></p>
        one of the card slots, she pulled a small plastic bag with a zipper.<p></p>
        Inside it were a number of folded slips of paper, and Mahiru took one of them out and<p></p>
        opened it up to show Amane.<p></p>
        Before he even had time to recognize it, he was looking at one of the DO ANYTHING<p></p>
        YOU SAY coupons he had given her a little over a month earlier.<p></p>
        Mahiru held out the coupon, decorated with an illustration of a bear that Amane<p></p>
        personally thought he had drawn quite well, and looked up at him pointedly again.<p></p>
        "Can I use it?"<p></p>
        "You can ask me to do anything you like."<p></p>
        "…Over Golden Week, I want one day with you," she said timidly. "I want to go shopping,<p></p>
        and hang out, and whatever else I request. All right?"<p></p>
        Amane let out a quiet laugh. "Come on, I would go shopping and stuff with you if you<p></p>
        asked. You don't really need to use a coupon for something so simple."<p></p>
        She probably wanted him to get all dressed up to take her out, but he would have done<p></p>
        that for her anytime, so he didn't think she had to go to so much trouble.<p></p>
        He laughed at her using her request for such a trivial thing, but Mahiru shook her head<p></p>
        with an earnest look in her eyes.<p></p>
        "Since I'm using the coupon… I get to ask for anything I feel like on that day."<p></p>
        "I-if you insist, that's fine, but… what are you planning to make me do?"<p></p>
        "…C-carry my bags."<p></p>
        "Yes, yes, as you wish."<p></p>
        He was tempted to crack a joke about her making him carry super-heavy bags, but<p></p>
        Mahiru just nodded. Even Mahiru, who was at heart an indoor person, sometimes<p></p>
        enjoyed going on an outing, and if she wanted him to accompany her, he intended to<p></p>
        do just that, as much as she desired. Besides, it was sure to have its benefits.<p></p>
        Although Amane would have preferred not to start a fresh wave of rumors about<p></p>
        Mahiru's mystery man, life would be dull if the fear of rumors kept them from going<p></p>
        anywhere.<p></p>
        "So where do you plan on taking us?"<p></p>
        "Ah, I—I haven't decided yet, but—"<p></p>
        "You haven't decided…?"<p></p>
        "…I mean, I'm not sure what kinds of places you like, so…"<p></p>
        "Huh, me?"<p></p>
        "Well, if we're out together, I thought it would be nice to pick a place we could both<p></p>
        enjoy. Is that all right?"<p></p>
        No one in the world could have refused Mahiru as she grabbed hold of his sleeve and<p></p>
        looked up at him imploringly.<p></p>
        Amane's breath caught in his throat, and his eyes darted about in confusion. Then he<p></p>
        roughly brushed back his hair and let out a small sigh.<p></p>
        "…I was just planning to go along with wherever you wanted to go, Mahiru, but well…<p></p>
        in that case, there is one place I'd like to go."<p></p>
        It was difficult for him to go in alone, but it was someplace he always wanted to try<p></p>
        going at least once.<p></p>
        "Where is that?"<p></p>
        "Promise not to laugh."<p></p>
        "I won't laugh."<p></p>
        "…A cat cafe ."<p></p>
        That's right, a cat cafe , filled to the brim with adorable cats.<p></p>
        Amane liked animals a fair amount, but of course he wasn't able to keep a pet in an<p></p>
        apartment and could only admire animals in magazines or other people's pets. But he<p></p>
        was too afraid of what people might think if they saw a single guy going to an animal<p></p>
        cafe . He was just too embarrassed to go.<p></p>
        However, if Mahiru was with him, he could go without worrying about other people's<p></p>
        stares following him. They might stare for other reasons, but he felt like he could at<p></p>
        least enter a cafe without reservations if Mahiru was by his side.<p></p>
        Besides all that, Amane also thought Mahiru would look very cute playing with cats,<p></p>
        but of course he couldn't say that out loud.<p></p>
        "…Well, I th-thought that if we were together, I wouldn't be embarrassed. Do you<p></p>
        mind?"<p></p>
        "N-no, not at all! All right then… Let's go together, shall we?"<p></p>
        "…Yeah."<p></p>
        Amane couldn't hide his nervousness. He felt both grateful and awkward that Mahiru<p></p>
        had accepted his request. She giggled softly, and heat began to creep up Amane's face.<p></p>
        Quickly, he changed the subject.<p></p>
        "What should we do after the cafe ?"<p></p>
        "After that, we'll go shopping together, and… ah, I want to try going to an arcade. I've<p></p>
        never been to a place like that."<p></p>
        Amane was not surprised to hear that the aristocratic Mahiru had never been to a<p></p>
        game center. But she was apparently interested, so in that case, he was more than<p></p>
        willing to take her to one and teach her the ropes.<p></p>
        The last game center he visited would probably have gotten a new shipment of stuffed<p></p>
        animals she would like by now, and it would be fun to win them together.<p></p>
        "All right, sounds like that'll be good. We'll go to a cat cafe , eat lunch, go shopping, and<p></p>
        go to a game center, okay?"<p></p>
        Amane sighed with relief once they had settled on their schedule for the day, and<p></p>
        Mahiru looked up again so he could see her face.<p></p>
        "Yep, I'm really looking forward to it."<p></p>
        He nearly stopped breathing when she looked at him so bashfully.<p></p>
        "I can't wait for the break to be here," she added quietly, and to Amane, it sounded like<p></p>
        she was looking forward to their outing from the bottom of her heart. She hugged the<p></p>
        cushion tightly, clearly in a good mood.<p></p>
        Amane was momentarily stunned by her sweet smile. He could feel his heart pounding.<p></p>
        "…Me too," he managed to reply hoarsely.<p></p>
        The surprise attack from the angel really made his heart ache<p></p>
        Chapter 34: Fooling Around in the Angel’s Cooking Classroom<p></p>
        "Welcome to the first-ever Mahirun Cooking Class!"<p></p>
        Chitose made this announcement with the rhythm and energy of a television cooking<p></p>
        program's intro. Amane shot her an annoyed look.<p></p>
        Golden Week had started, and they had decided to hold Mahiru's cooking class on the<p></p>
        first day of the break. The venue was Amane's apartment, for the simple reason that it<p></p>
        was an easy place for Mahiru and Chitose to meet.<p></p>
        Chitose's family was at her house, so they wouldn't be able to get too noisy, and Mahiru<p></p>
        had volunteered her place, but Amane had balked at going into a girl's apartment, so<p></p>
        they had settled on his.<p></p>
        Wearing an apron, Chitose was getting herself all worked up. "Yaaay! We've invited<p></p>
        Miss Mahiru Shiina to be our lecturer for the course!"<p></p>
        Mahiru, too, was wearing her apron and a wry smile as she stood next to Chitose.<p></p>
        "You didn't invite her anywhere," Amane insisted. "You're also a guest here, you know."<p></p>
        "And as our taste tester… we've invited the extremely tiresome Mr. Amane Fujimiya!"<p></p>
        "Oh, shut up. Also, this my house."<p></p>
        "He's no fun at all!"<p></p>
        Amane just couldn't keep up with Chitose's incredibly high-energy personality this<p></p>
        early in the morning. It was just past nine. They had planned to finish cooking around<p></p>
        lunchtime, so this was the only time they could meet.<p></p>
        Amane didn't really mind the hour, but Chitose was a lot to deal with right after waking<p></p>
        up.<p></p>
        "…Sorry about this, first thing in the morning…," Mahiru apologized.<p></p>
        "No, it's fine. You are making me lunch, after all," Amane insisted. "Though, speaking<p></p>
        of which, please keep an eye on Chitose so she doesn't put anything strange in it."<p></p>
        "O, ye of little faith!"<p></p>
        "Have you forgotten your previous offense on Valentine's Day…?"<p></p>
        He still hadn't forgotten the taste of her prank chocolates. The ones with nothing weird<p></p>
        in them had been delicious, of course, but the taste of the surprise special chocolates<p></p>
        had been shocking enough that he could recall it even now. And he couldn't trust<p></p>
        Chitose's palate, since she claimed she had been able to eat those experimental pieces<p></p>
        like regular sweets.<p></p>
        "Ah-ha-ha, but those were meant to be a prank. It'll be fine if I'm cooking normally.<p></p>
        Probably."<p></p>
        "That 'probably' worries me, you ass… I'm begging you, please make something I can<p></p>
        eat."<p></p>
        "Don't worry about it!" said Chitose confidently as she started rolling up her sleeves.<p></p>
        Amane felt a tinge of anxiety as he watched the girls set up, but he believed Mahiru<p></p>
        would probably intervene on his behalf somehow.<p></p>
        Mahiru didn't compromise on dishes she planned to serve to other people, and she<p></p>
        was the one running this lesson, so Amane was confident they would make the food<p></p>
        properly, and everything would be fine.<p></p>
        With Chitose in tow, Mahiru headed for his kitchen as if it were her own home and<p></p>
        read out the names of the dishes on the day's menu.<p></p>
        Namely, today's lunch would consist of a quiche and salad, with shrimp bisque and a<p></p>
        saute of any excess ingredients. She had apparently decided to answer Amane's<p></p>
        request to include shrimp.<p></p>
        He was sure that everything would go okay, but he still worried about Chitose putting<p></p>
        something strange into the quiche.<p></p>
        "…I feel like you're being needlessly wary…," Chitose protested. Maybe she had noticed<p></p>
        him staring at her.<p></p>
        Amane averted his eyes and flopped down on the sofa. His job was to be a taste tester,<p></p>
        so he didn't really have to do anything, and that suited him just fine. He wasn't totally<p></p>
        useless as Mahiru's helper, but that was Chitose's role today, and anyway, he had been<p></p>
        instructed by Mahiru to sit down, so he couldn't move from his spot. 1<p></p>
        And so he had lots of free time.<p></p>
        He looked into the kitchen and saw the two girls in their aprons pleasantly chatting as<p></p>
        they started their work.<p></p>
        They were both beautiful girls in different ways, and having them both here, wearing<p></p>
        aprons and cooking in his apartment, would surely make any other boy in their class<p></p>
        drool with envy, Amane mused, as if he were an uninvolved observer.<p></p>
        Fighting off a second round of anxiety over whether the practical jokester might pull<p></p>
        something outrageous, Amane let his eyes drift closed, unsure of what else to do with<p></p>
        his glut of free time.<p></p>
        Apparently, cooking class would take several hours, so they probably wouldn't mind if<p></p>
        he took a little nap. It was his apartment, after all, so the only one who could blame<p></p>
        him for anything was… Mahiru.<p></p>
        Amane let out a small yawn and made himself comfortable on the sofa.<p></p>
        When he came to, Amane detected a sweet scent nearby. It was an aroma he had<p></p>
        become used to, a sweet fragrance that was milky and floral, hard to describe but<p></p>
        extremely pleasant, so without thinking, he inhaled deeply.<p></p>
        In his barely conscious state, he brought his face closer to the source of the smell and<p></p>
        felt something warm and soft to the touch. When he snuggled his cheek closer to the<p></p>
        pleasant warmth, it started to squirm.<p></p>
        "…Ah, um, that tickles…," said a halting voice from somewhere very close by. Amane<p></p>
        realized someone was patting his thigh. This quickly dragged his dim consciousness<p></p>
        up to the surface, and when he pried open his heavy eyelids… what he saw was an<p></p>
        expanse of smooth milky white.<p></p>
        He nervously lifted his head and found Mahiru's flushed face incredibly close to his.<p></p>
        She looked very embarrassed.<p></p>
        "…Mahiru?"<p></p>
        "Yes?"<p></p>
        "…Uh… good morning?"<p></p>
        "Good morning. Although… actually, it's already time to say good afternoon."<p></p>
        He looked at the digital clock on the shelf and saw that it was past noon.<p></p>
        He had dozed off for quite a while, he realized. But what was Mahiru doing by his side?<p></p>
        "When I sat down next to you, you leaned onto me."<p></p>
        Mahiru answered his unspoken question, her cheeks still tinged slightly red.<p></p>
        Apparently, he had nestled his face into the area near her shoulder. The shirt she was<p></p>
        wearing today had a fairly open neckline, which left some skin peeking out, and that<p></p>
        seemed to be where he had stuck his face.<p></p>
        If he was unlucky, she might consider this a matter of sexual harassment, so he<p></p>
        prepared himself for her anger, but Mahiru seemed more embarrassed than angry and<p></p>
        just cast her eyes downward.<p></p>
        Personally, he would have preferred for her to get mad, because he was truly at a loss<p></p>
        for what to do when she reacted that way. He appeared to have been forgiven, which<p></p>
        made him uncomfortable.<p></p>
        "That's— I'm sorry," Amane apologized. "It must have been a pain."<p></p>
        "N-no, not at all!" she insisted.<p></p>
        "Quite the contrary, Mahirun said 'I'm going to take advantage of the fact that Amane's<p></p>
        half asleep' and sat down to catch your head."<p></p>
        "Chitose!" Mahiru turned even redder.<p></p>
        "And just when did you two start calling each other by your first names, I wonder?"<p></p>
        Chitose grinned.<p></p>
        "…Chitose."<p></p>
        "Don't scowl at me, Amane. You're the one who was careless!"<p></p>
        He couldn't argue with that. In his half-conscious state, he'd called Mahiru by her first<p></p>
        name even though Chitose was there. That was his error.<p></p>
        "And anyway, Mahirun already told me about how you two talk when no one else is<p></p>
