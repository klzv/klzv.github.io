        <p></p>
        She gazed with satisfaction at Amane, still frozen in place, then reverted to her usual<p></p>
        smile as she headed for the kitchen. "Well, I'm going to go make dinner."<p></p>
        Amane watched her go, cheeks burning.<p></p>
        Chapter 45: Before the Test, a Moment<p></p>
        The Sunday before the start of exams, Amane was studying quietly in his own room.<p></p>
        He wanted to get high marks, but there was also another reason he was studying—he<p></p>
        was trying to drive thoughts of Mahiru out of his head.<p></p>
        "…I'm going to spoil you as much as I like, so just relax and enjoy it, okay?"<p></p>
        Mahiru had whispered those unbelievable words with a devilish smile, and now<p></p>
        thoughts of her threatened to fill his head, leaving room for nothing else.<p></p>
        Amane didn't know whether Mahiru's recent suggestive behavior toward him was<p></p>
        intentional, but it was certainly effective. He appreciated it, but at the same time, it<p></p>
        made him nervous.<p></p>
        Until he was sure of Mahiru's intentions, he couldn't really make a move.<p></p>
        All sorts of questions troubled him, so to drive them all away, he'd been studying<p></p>
        furiously since early morning. His efforts were at least somewhat successful, because<p></p>
        he'd gotten so caught up in the work that by the time he realized, it was past two in<p></p>
        the afternoon.<p></p>
        The fact that he had worked straight through without eating lunch was proof of how<p></p>
        focused he had been, but now that he had noticed the time and checked the clock, his<p></p>
        stomach immediately growled with hunger.<p></p>
        "…I guess I should at least eat lunch."<p></p>
        Amane stretched out to relieve some of the stiffness that had built up after sitting in<p></p>
        one place for so long. Then he stood up and left his room.<p></p>
        Mahiru had said she would be home alone studying for exams that day, and she hadn't<p></p>
        come over to Amane's. That meant Amane would have to fix lunch on his own.<p></p>
        Thinking about how he'd been spoiled with good food since meeting Mahiru, he<p></p>
        headed for the kitchen and opened the refrigerator.<p></p>
        He put a frozen portion of rice that had been set aside for quick use into the<p></p>
        microwave, and while it was thawing, he took a bowl and scooped out several types of<p></p>
        the preserved vegetables that Mahiru had prepared ahead of time, guaranteeing some<p></p>
        color and nutrients for his meal.<p></p>
        All of this is Mahiru's doing.<p></p>
        If it had been just Amane, he wouldn't have prepared any vegetables. His lunch<p></p>
        would've come from the convenience store.<p></p>
        Now he had a fair amount of food in the house, and he also knew how to make some<p></p>
        things himself. They weren't on the same level as Mahiru's cooking, which was always<p></p>
        delicious, lovely to look at, and nutritious to boot. Still, he had learned to make some<p></p>
        edible dishes.<p></p>
        Using what he'd learned from Mahiru, Amane made a simple fried rice for lunch with<p></p>
        just eggs and bacon. But the meal turned out to be plenty colorful thanks to the side<p></p>
        dishes Mahiru had prepared.<p></p>
        With the addition of instant Chinese-style soup, it was a perfectly satisfactory menu<p></p>
        for an easy lunch.<p></p>
        He loaded it all on a tray and carried it over to the dining table.<p></p>
        "Let's eat."<p></p>
        He smiled softly as he looked down at a weekend lunch that he previously would have<p></p>
        had trouble imagining. Then he pressed his hands together in thanks and picked up<p></p>
        his spoon.<p></p>
        The fried rice that he brought to his mouth had a somewhat strong flavor, different<p></p>
        from Mahiru's, but it wasn't bad. It turned out to be well seasoned for something<p></p>
        prepared by a high school boy.<p></p>
        It's really different, huh?<p></p>
        Amane's eating habits had completely changed, and so had various other things about<p></p>
        him. In all sorts of ways, he had become completely spoiled.<p></p>
        He wondered if he was becoming a better person in his daily life. After experiencing<p></p>
        life with Mahiru, Amane didn't want to return to his previous existence—now that he<p></p>
        knew life could be this good, he didn't want to go back. He had become really spoiled,<p></p>
        in the sense that he felt he would never be satisfied if Mahiru left.<p></p>
        He wasn't only pampered in all practical aspects of life; he was spoiled emotionally as<p></p>
        well.<p></p>
        Amane remembered something he had heard before from his father, Shuuto.<p></p>
        Apparently, the Fujimiya men were the earnestly devoted type. The type who falls in<p></p>
        love with only one person and then treasures them.<p></p>
        Amane did not have to think about whether he too had inherited those tendencies.<p></p>
        Ever since he had become aware that he was in love with Mahiru, he paid even less<p></p>
        attention to other girls. The most important thing was that he wanted to treasure<p></p>
        Mahiru and make her happy.<p></p>
        …I won't settle for anyone but Mahiru. 5<p></p>
        Whether he was the one to bring her joy or not, as long as Mahiru was happy, he<p></p>
        decided he would back off right away if she fell for someone else and chose that person<p></p>
        instead. He told himself that seeing Mahiru smiling joyfully was enough.<p></p>
        However, he also had contradictory feelings. He really wanted to be the one to make<p></p>
        her happy, and he definitely didn't want to give her away. He didn't want to be apart<p></p>
        from Mahiru, and he liked being the only one who really knew her.<p></p>
        Some people would probably call what he was feeling an obsession—his heart was<p></p>
        full of emotions that he could not explain to anyone else, like the feeling that he just<p></p>
        couldn't live without Mahiru.<p></p>
        She wasn't just a pretty face; she had a pure heart as well. Amane had frankly been<p></p>
        manipulated by the deep, strong feeling of love that was in his heart.<p></p>
        "…I wouldn't have so much trouble if I was more assertive."<p></p>
        Amane laughed a little. The words that he had muttered out loud naturally had a selfdeprecating ring to
        them.<p></p>
        For the first time in his sixteen years of life, he was in love with someone, and he<p></p>
        wanted to be the one by her side, but he had no idea how to make that happen.<p></p>
        Anyone else would probably have laughed, if they knew that he had made it to sixteen<p></p>
        without experiencing his first love. 3<p></p>
        He was aware that he had a craven and cautious nature, and that he didn't know the<p></p>
        first thing about approaching girls. He believed that these qualities had helped earn<p></p>
        Mahiru's trust, and that they weren't things that he could change easily. But he had<p></p>
        always wished that he could be more assertive.<p></p>
        That was exactly why he was working so hard at his studies and making an effort to<p></p>
        exercise. He was trying to gain some self-confidence.<p></p>
        With a quiet, bitter smile, Amane scarfed down the rest of the fried rice.<p></p>
        Amane took a short break after eating to limber up his stiff muscles with some more<p></p>
        stretching, and while he was at it, he decided to do some light exercise to relax. He<p></p>
        changed into running clothes in his room.<p></p>
        He had been sitting at his desk for a while, so he figured a bit of physical activity would<p></p>
        be a good change of pace.<p></p>
        Still, he didn't have that much stamina. He would need to reserve some energy for<p></p>
        studying more later. He was sure that he would sleep like a log that night.<p></p>
        Reminding himself to be careful not to overdo it, Amane stepped through the door, and<p></p>
        happened to meet Mahiru just as she was walking out of her own apartment.<p></p>
        "Ah, Amane… Going to exercise?"<p></p>
        She could clearly tell by his outfit. She gave him a charming smile, and he nodded in<p></p>
        response. Mahiru was dressed like she was going out, so Amane figured he must have<p></p>
        caught her just as she was leaving.<p></p>
        For a second, he remembered what had happened the day before and almost groaned<p></p>
        out loud, but he had calmed down a little since then, so he didn't get flustered from<p></p>
        just seeing her.<p></p>
        "Yeah, I need a break," he replied. "You too? Looks like you're going shopping."<p></p>
        "Yes. Speaking of which, I remember being low on eggs. I thought I'd make rolled<p></p>
        omelets for dinner tonight. We've got exams tomorrow, and if I leave some for<p></p>
        breakfast, they might help you do your best…"<p></p>
        "Seriously? Suddenly I feel a surge of energy!"<p></p>
        "I'm doing it for my sake, too, you know." Mahiru put a hand over her mouth and<p></p>
        giggled a little.<p></p>
        Amane answered, frowning slightly, "I can't help myself; you make the best omelets."<p></p>
        This brought the conversation to a pause, but both knew that Amane wasn't actually<p></p>
        upset. Through the gaps in Mahiru's fingers, he could see her smile widen.<p></p>
        "Ah, that's right, I used the last egg and also some bacon earlier. And I ate one of the<p></p>
        frozen portions of rice."<p></p>
        "Oh, you made your own lunch?" Mahiru remarked. "Impressive."<p></p>
        "…I feel like you're making fun of me. I believe I do cook occasionally even when you're<p></p>
        over."<p></p>
        Naturally, Amane felt bad about leaving all the cooking to Mahiru, so he usually tried<p></p>
        to help her with simple tasks, and on days when Mahiru seemed to be tired or feeling<p></p>
        down, he would take over and make the meals.<p></p>
        There were limits to what he could make, so sometimes the menu deviated<p></p>
        considerably from what they had planned on. Disregarding the presentation and<p></p>
        accepting that the flavor would be inferior to Mahiru's food, Amane was capable of<p></p>
        cooking a passable meal.<p></p>
        So there was no reason for her to praise him like that just because he had made lunch.<p></p>
        "I know that, but you hardly ever do it when you're home alone, right? You tend to<p></p>
        choose instant meals when you're by yourself, because cooking is a pain and you're<p></p>
        fine with something easy."<p></p>
        "Uh—"<p></p>
        "Guessing from the ingredients and from your repertoire, I bet you made fried rice or<p></p>
        something like that. It sounds like you did a good job, so that's great."<p></p>
        Amane was at a loss for words. She saw right through him. He thought he could feel<p></p>
        his blood begin to boil.<p></p>
        Mahiru broke the tension when she laughed out loud and extended a hand toward<p></p>
        Amane. She gently combed her fingers through his hair, fluffing it up as she hit him<p></p>
        with a charming smile.<p></p>
        Amane pursed his lips tightly. He didn't hate the feeling; rather, it made him happy. He<p></p>
        really had become spoiled.<p></p>
        "…Knock it off already, geez."<p></p>
        "Aw, too bad. I wanted to do it more."<p></p>
        As she said that, Mahiru readily pulled away and smiled gently.<p></p>
        It occurred to Amane that his serious expression was only making things worse, and<p></p>
        he turned away from her.<p></p>
        "…Are eggs the only thing you're buying?"<p></p>
        He changed the subject so that Mahiru couldn't pet him anymore.<p></p>
        "Let's see, there are other ingredients I need for dinner, like the eggs… and milk, but<p></p>
        that should do it, I think. I was planning to make a quick trip, so I figured I'd just go to<p></p>
        the closest grocery store."<p></p>
        "Got it. I can pick all that up on my way back home."<p></p>
        Amane wouldn't have said anything if Mahiru had other errands or shopping to do<p></p>
        besides for groceries, things he couldn't do in her stead. But if she didn't have anything<p></p>
        else to go out for, there was no reason for her to spend the extra time and effort.<p></p>
        Amane was going outside anyway, so it would be better to have her stay home and do<p></p>
        something else she wanted to do. She spent time every night making him dinner, so he<p></p>
        figured he should at least do this much.<p></p>
        "Huh? But then you'll have to carry it all."<p></p>
        "It's fine, I'll go shopping on my way back. And it's not like the grocery store is that far."<p></p>
        "Wh-what about money?"<p></p>
        "I've got my cash card with me. And I've already checked the balance. I can get a receipt<p></p>
        from the supermarket, so there won't be any problem with splitting the bill or<p></p>
        anything."<p></p>
        Amane cocked his head as to ask if there was anything else, and this time, Mahiru<p></p>
        fumbled over her words.<p></p>
        "…Sorry to make you do this."<p></p>
        "I told you, it's fine; I'm going out anyway."<p></p>
        Amane ruffled Mahiru's hair in retaliation, and she looked at him with narrowed eyes<p></p>
        as if he was tickling her. Something in her expression looked genuinely happy, and<p></p>
        Amane was quietly relieved that he hadn't committed some grave mistake.<p></p>
        "…All right, I'll leave it to you. I'll be waiting at home."<p></p>
        "Whose home?"<p></p>
        "I wonder?"<p></p>
        Mahiru tilted her head slightly to the side, looking bashful. Then without missing a<p></p>
        beat, she opened the door to Amane's apartment, using the spare key that she had<p></p>
        been holding already, and slipped in smoothly through the crack.<p></p>
        Having made her answer obvious, Mahiru peeked back out through the door and<p></p>
        smiled at Amane.<p></p>
        "See you when you get back, Amane."<p></p>
        "…I'm going now," he replied, feeling amused by Mahiru, who no longer seemed to care<p></p>
        whose apartment was whose. 1<p></p>
        Mahiru's smile grew wider as she waved good-bye to Amane.<p></p>
        After warming up with some light stretching, Amane went for an easy jog that lasted<p></p>
        a little less than an hour, and then made a trip to the supermarket as part of his<p></p>
        cooldown before returning home.<p></p>
        Since he was jogging, he was able to relax and exercise without overthinking, and his<p></p>
        mind quieted a little bit. For now, things seemed to have settled down without him<p></p>
        having to respond to all of Mahiru's provocations, so he returned home feeling<p></p>
        relieved. With the quiet shuffling of her house slippers, Mahiru came to greet him at<p></p>
        the door.<p></p>
        "Welcome home. I went ahead and filled the bath with hot water. Want to get in?" 2<p></p>
        She casually took the shopping bags out of his hands, and he found himself gaping at<p></p>
        her.<p></p>
        Itsuki and Yuuta had both said that she acted exactly like a newlywed wife, and she<p></p>
        really did. Mahiru herself probably didn't intend it that way, but her movements were<p></p>
        brisk and efficient, and somebody who didn't know better might have made that<p></p>
        assumption. Amane felt strangely embarrassed by the thought.<p></p>
        "…Amane?"<p></p>
        "Ah, it's nothing. Thank you, I will go take a bath."<p></p>
        He smiled vaguely in response to the strange look from Mahiru, rinsed his hands at<p></p>
        the sink, then headed for his room to get ready for the bath.<p></p>
        He pulled out his usual loungewear, and then went into the bathroom, where, as<p></p>
        Mahiru had said, the bathtub was full of piping hot water and set to the perfect<p></p>
        temperature.<p></p>
        After saying a silent thanks to Mahiru for being so prepared and generally being there<p></p>
        for him, he showered off the sweat from his run.<p></p>
        Amane was self-indulgent and lazy at heart, but that didn't mean he was okay with<p></p>
        being dirty. He was someone who enjoyed a good bath.<p></p>
        When he submerged himself in the bathtub after properly washing the filth off his<p></p>
        body and hair, it felt like all the fatigue in his mind and body melted away. He realized<p></p>
        that he was pretty worn out as the exhaustion seemed to dissolve in the hot water.<p></p>
        As he soaked in the bathwater that was just the right temperature, Amane leaned back<p></p>
        against the side of the tub and exhaled.<p></p>
        Then he looked down at his body through the clear water—he hadn't added bath salts<p></p>
        or anything to it—and his exhale turned into a sigh.<p></p>
        "…Still got a lot of work to do, huh?"<p></p>
        It hadn't been very long since he'd started really exercising, so it was to be expected.<p></p>
        Amane had very little muscle on his body because he had never trained and ate<p></p>
        properly. He was extremely thin, a far cry from his image of masculinity. The words<p></p>
        bean sprout came immediately to mind.<p></p>
        Amane wanted to get a little stronger and improve his looks while he was at it. Some<p></p>
        of his classmates had seen him in his "mystery man" form before, so he couldn't<p></p>
        heedlessly assume that look without attracting suspicion, but he knew that he could<p></p>
        be more diligent with his skin care and grooming.<p></p>
        He admired Mahiru, who was never negligent in her daily self-care. He was sure that<p></p>
        she must put in a lot of work that he wasn't even aware of.<p></p>
        As he thought about all these things, Amane felt a considerable drowsiness creep over<p></p>
        him, probably from the comfortable warmth of the water and his own fatigue. He let<p></p>
        out another deep sigh as he began dozing off in the tub.<p></p>
        Eventually, Mahiru, concerned that he was taking too long in the bath, ended up<p></p>
        waking him in a panic when she opened the bathroom door to check on him.<p></p>
        "Um, you know… it's dangerous to stay in too long, okay?"<p></p>
        "I'm really sorry for being so careless."<p></p>
        All Amane could do was apologize earnestly. He wasn't sure whether Mahiru's flushed<p></p>
        cheeks were due to anger or embarrassment from glimpsing his top half in the bath—<p></p>
        he imagined it was at least partially from worry.<p></p>
        He had heard that people had drowned in as little as thirty centimeters of water, so<p></p>
        Mahiru's anger seemed justified. Amane imagined that she was all the more anxious<p></p>
        because she herself couldn't swim.<p></p>
        He tried to come up with some excuse, but his mind was in a fog.<p></p>
        He hadn't been completely asleep; really it was more like his consciousness was<p></p>
        dipping a toe into the ocean of slumber. He was confident that he would have woken<p></p>
        up without a problem if he had lost his balance and bumped into the side of the tub.<p></p>
        "…Why are you pushing yourself so hard?"<p></p>
        Amane felt instantly remorseful when he heard the suspicion in Mahiru's words. He<p></p>
        could tell that he'd messed up when he heard the anxiety in her voice, which made it<p></p>
        clear that he'd given her cause for stress.<p></p>
        "I won't deny the value of hard work," Mahiru continued, "but if you can't handle it all,<p></p>
        shouldn't you ease up a little?"<p></p>
        "You're right, of course. I'll be more careful next time."<p></p>
        "But why are you doing all this, Amane?" she asked again.<p></p>
        "…I guess… because I want to become someone I can be proud of."<p></p>
        Even though she sounded a little angry, Mahiru looked mostly sad. Amane smiled<p></p>
        meekly and stroked her head to try to wipe away the anxious look in her eyes, while<p></p>
        vowing not to make such a mistake again.<p></p>
        "I've been thinking I wanna be more confident in myself, is all. And I wanted to start<p></p>
        with things like my studies and exercise. I didn't mean to worry you; this was really all<p></p>
        my fault. Next time, I'll keep in mind how much I can handle."<p></p>
        "…Are you in that big of a hurry?"<p></p>
        "I guess there's probably no rush, but I want to work harder… To make myself into<p></p>
        someone I can be confident in. After all, I'm working hard for my own sake," Amane<p></p>
        told her with a smile as he rubbed her head.<p></p>
        Mahiru stared hard into Amane's eyes, then sighed. "…I understand your determination.<p></p>
        That said, I'm serious: If you don't take better care of yourself, I'm going to get really<p></p>
        worried, okay?"<p></p>
        "I said I was sorry."<p></p>
        "But I think you really shine when you try so hard, and I don't want to get in the way<p></p>
        of your progress. I've been watching you but trying not to get in your way."<p></p>
        "If anything, you're the one keeping me going," he insisted. "Taking care of meals is<p></p>
        really a huge help. I can't manage that as well as you can, after all."<p></p>
        "You're the one putting in all the effort, so it would be more accurate to say that it's all<p></p>
        I can do to help… Do your best, but don't push yourself too hard, okay?"<p></p>
        "I'll try not to make you worry again."<p></p>
        No doubt, he would be careful not to fall asleep in the bath again. He had no desire to<p></p>
        learn what drowning felt like.<p></p>
        Amane also didn't want to make Mahiru fret and cry, so he decided to take better care<p></p>
        of his physical health and not overexert himself.<p></p>
        Mahiru still looked a little skeptical, so he continued to try to reassure her by gently<p></p>
        stroking her hair.<p></p>
        Chapter 46: After the Test, a Moment<p></p>
        Two days passed, and the tests were over. Amane felt liberated.<p></p>
        He surprisingly spent less time sitting at his desk during exams than when regular<p></p>
        classes were in session, and he found that test prep was easier than his usual studies.<p></p>
        Though this time around, there had been additional pressure, because he was more<p></p>
        invested in the outcome.<p></p>
        Typically, Amane put in a reasonable amount of effort and always got a decent score.<p></p>
        However, this time, he'd spent extra time studying and really focused on acing his<p></p>
        exams. He'd been a bit nervous going into the tests, but now that they were over, he<p></p>
        felt satisfied with his performance.<p></p>
        He had gotten together with Mahiru to compare their answers from the previous day's<p></p>
        tests, and although he hadn't gotten a perfect score, it seemed like he had gotten a very<p></p>
        good one. They would probably go over today's questions in detail once they got home,<p></p>
        and Amane was confident that he had answered better this time around.<p></p>
        Amane leaned back against his chair and let his body relax as he took a break. Chitose<p></p>
        staggered over, looking like she had been drained of all vitality.<p></p>
        "Amaneee, how'd it go?"<p></p>
        Her expression lacked its usual luster. Amane knew that Chitose was not a big fan of<p></p>
        studying. She was a quick learner but not the kind of person to put in the work, and in<p></p>
        this case, she didn't prepare enough.<p></p>
        "There wasn't anything specific that gave me trouble, so I think I did well," he<p></p>
        answered.<p></p>
        "Wow, you were really serious about it this time. You gonna ask me how I did?"<p></p>
        "Let me guess, you did terribly but somehow avoided failing?"<p></p>
        "You got it."<p></p>
        "After all that tutoring, it'd be a shame if you still failed."<p></p>
        Compared to Itsuki and Chitose, and even Yuuta, Mahiru and Amane were far enough<p></p>
        ahead in their studies that they had time to help Chitose so she could pass the tests.<p></p>
        Chitose's cheekiness and her attitude toward school often got in the way of her<p></p>
        studies, but fundamentally, she had a good head on her shoulders and wasn't bad at<p></p>
        understanding the material—so as long as it was taught well, she would grasp it<p></p>
        quickly.<p></p>
        As for whether she would retain the information after the tests, that depended on<p></p>
        whether she ever bothered to review it.<p></p>
        "It's fine, it's fine! I did better than ever before!" she said triumphantly.<p></p>
        "Glad to hear it. Not that the bar was all that high, but… as long as you're happy, I'm<p></p>
        happy. Just remember to work hard at the end of the semester, too."<p></p>
        "Whaa—? We just finished these tests; don't talk about the next ones… that's<p></p>
        depressing… Right now, I want to celebrate our freedom! Right, Itsuki?"<p></p>
        "That's right! We shouldn't spend the present dwelling on the past or thinking about<p></p>
        some far-off future."<p></p>
        Itsuki, slumped listlessly in his chair behind Amane, groaned and agreed with what<p></p>
        Chitose had said. Itsuki had obviously studied more seriously than Chitose, but the<p></p>
        English exam had practically done him in, and he had no energy left.<p></p>
        "I want to compare my test answers with someone, though," Amane said.<p></p>
        "No way! Don't make us think about the tests anymore!"<p></p>
        Itsuki and Chitose clung to each other, looking absolutely exhausted, commiserating<p></p>
        over their trials and tribulations.<p></p>
        "You seem lively enough to me," Amane grumbled, and shifted his gaze to the throng<p></p>
        of people in the classroom who had finished their exams.<p></p>
        They were gathering one after another around Mahiru, probably to compare answers<p></p>
        with her.<p></p>
        They wanted to see Mahiru's answers, since she had gotten nearly perfect scores on<p></p>
        previous tests. With a humble smile, Mahiru pulled out her various answer sheets.<p></p>
        Amane had no desire to join the fray, so he would compare answers with her at home.<p></p>
        "…Must be tough."<p></p>
        He didn't call Mahiru by name, but it must have been clear who he meant.<p></p>
        Itsuki and Chitose both looked over at Mahiru and grinned.<p></p>
        "Well, the angel is cute, and clever, and popular, so she's in great demand."<p></p>
        "You could get in there too and help her out?"<p></p>
        "I don't see any need for that," he scoffed.<p></p>
        "Yeah, guess you're right."<p></p>
        "Plus, you'll be there when she gets home"—Itsuki didn't say that part out loud, but<p></p>
        Amane knew the logical conclusion of that train of thought. He was grateful to his<p></p>
        friend for not voicing it, but Itsuki's grinning face, which basically said he knew all<p></p>
        about it, was more than enough to make Amane irritable.<p></p>
        Itsuki laughed again at Amane's scowl, and the lines in Amane's forehead grew deeper.<p></p>
        Then he heard another voice laughing with amusement, and he relaxed his grimace<p></p>
        just a little.<p></p>
        "Itsuki, if you tease him too much, Fujimiya will pout," Yuuta remarked.<p></p>
        "He's fine, he's fine, Amane won't get mad at me just for that."<p></p>
        "It looked like the vein in his temple was going to pop just now, though."<p></p>
        "Uh-oh, I think you're right."<p></p>
        Yuuta surprised Amane by stepping in to arbitrate. He shrugged and decided not to<p></p>
        smack Itsuki after all.<p></p>
        "Fujimiya, how were your grades? Must be good, looking at your face."<p></p>
        "Well, I think I did fairly well," Amane nodded. "How about you?"<p></p>
        "Thanks to your help, I feel like I scored more points than usual," Yuuta said. "Though<p></p>
        I won't know until I compare answers with someone later."<p></p>
        "I see; that's good to hear."<p></p>
        Amane had been worried about everyone's results, since their Saturday study session<p></p>
        had turned into a video game tournament halfway through, but based on the<p></p>
        impression he was getting from Yuuta, it had worked out okay.<p></p>
        Amane's expression softened a little as he thought back on that day and mused that it<p></p>
        might be nice to get together and study like that sometimes. Itsuki's face then showed<p></p>
        a clear look of discontent.<p></p>
        "Hey, you're letting Yuuta off awfully easy, aren't you, Amane?"<p></p>
        "Don't worry about him; reflect on your own bad habits."<p></p>
        "I believe that I am loved, even when you say such things."<p></p>
        "Don't get creepy. I—"<p></p>
        "That's right, there's only one person in this world who Amane loves."<p></p>
        Even though he muttered it under his breath, Itsuki had still crossed a line. Amane<p></p>
        grabbed his friend in a solid headlock.<p></p>
        Yuuta laughed and made no attempt to interfere, as though he knew that Itsuki<p></p>
        deserved it.<p></p>
        Chitose also seemed amused. "Itsuki, you're a real dummy." She smirked.<p></p>
        Itsuki, who was getting a knuckle forcibly ground into his forehead, had a foolish smile<p></p>
        on his face, as if it didn't hurt at all.<p></p>
        Amane wasn't putting any real strength behind the attack, so it shouldn't have hurt<p></p>
        that much, but he couldn't help but feel a little annoyed at how calm Itsuki was acting.<p></p>
        "Well, you're definitely devoted, Fujimiya. That's easy to see."<p></p>
        "Not you too, Kadowaki…"<p></p>
        "Hey, I didn't say what you're devoted to, just that you're devoted!" Yuuta beamed.<p></p>
        Amane couldn't think of anything to say, so he just turned away.<p></p>
        His behavior must have been amusing, because Itsuki, Chitose, and Yuuta all laughed<p></p>
        like something was hilarious. Amane stared in the opposite direction, biting his lip and<p></p>
        feeling extremely embarrassed.<p></p>
        Mahiru must have gotten free just at that moment. She locked eyes with him and<p></p>
        smiled.<p></p>
        Amane groaned, feeling even more embarrassed now that Mahiru had looked at him,<p></p>
        but she calmly walked over, wearing a smile on her face.<p></p>
        "Looks like you're having fun over here," she said. "What were you talking about?"<p></p>
        "Hmm? We were talking about how cute Amane is!"<p></p>
        "Watch it, Chitose—"<p></p>
        "That is what we were talking about, right?"<p></p>
        "Basically, they were all teasing me."<p></p>
        "Oh yeah, that too."<p></p>
        "See?! She admits it."<p></p>
        Amane shot Chitose a pointed look to tell her to cut it out, but Chitose seemed totally<p></p>
        indifferent. Instead, he glared at Itsuki, who was supposed to be in charge of<p></p>
        controlling her.<p></p>
        "Why are you glaring at me?"<p></p>
        "Maybe because you're the one who started all this in the first place?"<p></p>
        "So… what were you talking about, then?" Mahiru asked again.<p></p>
        "Oh, just the fact that Amane's a pure, innocent, devoted boy…," Chitose murmured.<p></p>
        Amane really wished she would shut up already.<p></p>
        "I don't know what all this nonsense about being 'pure' or whatever is." He scowled.<p></p>
        "What do you even mean, anyway? What's so pure about me?"<p></p>
        Itsuki put on a dramatic expression of exaggerated surprise. "Oh, don't tell me you<p></p>
        weren't aware…?"<p></p>
        Amane kicked his friend under the desk and glanced over at Mahiru. She was looking<p></p>
        upward slightly, with her usual smile on, as if she was pondering something.<p></p>
        "Actually, we were talking about how Fujimiya is rather stoic. I guess calling him<p></p>
        straightforward would be more accurate," Yuuta added.<p></p>
        "I see." Mahiru nodded. "Fujimiya is definitely the type to work hard once he sets his<p></p>
        mind to something. In that sense, he's a very straightforward person, isn't he? I think<p></p>
        that's a wonderful quality to have."<p></p>
        "It really is. I just wish that he would have some more confidence about it."<p></p>
        "That's very true," she agreed.<p></p>
        Amane couldn't stand being there a second longer listening to the two of them mock<p></p>
        him with their excessive praise.<p></p>
        He made eye contact with Mahiru, who gave him a gentle smile.<p></p>
        He felt embarrassed and immediately averted his eyes and saw that the rest of their<p></p>
        classmates were looking over enviously.<p></p>
        Their attention was not focused on him, but on Mahiru and Yuuta, who somehow<p></p>
        seemed to be hitting it off talking about Amane. That was a relief, but it brought up<p></p>
        some slightly complicated feelings.<p></p>
        Seeing the two most popular people chattering away and getting along with each other<p></p>
        would naturally attract attention. Amane felt a slight tinge of jealousy himself at the<p></p>
        fact that neither of the two seemed to be the least bit bothered by everyone looking at<p></p>
        them.<p></p>
        "What's wrong, Amane?" Chitose asked. "You're blushing…"<p></p>
        "I am not."<p></p>
        "You are too! And you're trying to hide it. Oh, Mahiru? After school, let's go have fun<p></p>
        somewhere, all five of us. We're all together already, and the tests are over, so let's<p></p>
        party!"<p></p>
        Completely ignoring Amane's uncooperative attitude, Chitose pivoted to Mahiru with<p></p>
        a suggestion. It was a casual invitation, without too much pressure, but with her usual<p></p>
        angelic smile still on her face, Mahiru answered, "Of course, if everyone wants to."<p></p>
        "The five of us" must have included Amane, too, but he probably didn't have the right<p></p>
        to veto the plan, and Chitose must have understood that he wasn't likely to reject it<p></p>
        anyway.<p></p>
        Chitose was wearing an expression that said, "I got you!"<p></p>
        Amane looked away again as he nodded his assent.<p></p>
        Chapter 47: A Reward from the Angel<p></p>
        <section id="47"></section>
        "Hey, Amane, don't you think you tried too hard this time?" Itsuki grumbled, sounding<p></p>
        somewhat astonished as he stared at the exam rankings that had been posted on the<p></p>
        bulletin board in the hallway.<p></p>
        Even after their group study session, Amane had continued working diligently,<p></p>
        preparing for the exams. He'd wanted to be proud of himself for a change. Also, the<p></p>
        studying had helped distract him from certain coquettish words that had been<p></p>
        whispered in his ear.<p></p>
        They were looking at the result of his efforts—and all the work he'd done to keep his<p></p>
        mind off her suggestive expressions and the words that she had uttered—which had<p></p>
        led him to rank sixth in their grade this time.<p></p>
        "Wow, it's hard to believe I made it that far."<p></p>
        "You really worked for it. Proud of yourself?"<p></p>
        "…Pretty proud, I guess. But there's no guarantee that I'll be able to do it again."<p></p>
        "What a stoic guy…"<p></p>
        He didn't want Mahiru to see him climb so high only to fall back down out of<p></p>
        negligence. There would be no point to it unless he could consistently place in the<p></p>
        upper ranks.<p></p>
        Considering that college entrance exams were also coming up, it would be absurd to<p></p>
        be satisfied with this one success and give up trying.<p></p>
        Hasty preparations would not be enough for the entrance exams since students from<p></p>
        other schools would also be vying for spots, so Amane vowed to keep studying hard<p></p>
        so that he would be ready for what was to come as well.<p></p>
        Incidentally, Mahiru had placed far ahead of anyone else, in the top spot again. This<p></p>
        was nothing if not expected, but Amane knew that it was because of how hard she<p></p>
        worked, and that she never took it for granted.<p></p>
        "It looks like you took sixth place this time, Fujimiya."<p></p>
        Mahiru, who had arrived to look at the bulletin board after Amane and Itsuki, smiled<p></p>
        beautifully as she noticed Amane's name.<p></p>
        She was in angel mode, and Amane smiled casually back at her, trying not to let any of<p></p>
        his inner turmoil show on his face.<p></p>
        He felt the prickle of people's eyes on him, but he was already getting used to talking<p></p>
        with Mahiru in public. The stares still made him uncomfortable, but he was able to<p></p>
        soldier through without too much distress.<p></p>
        "Looks that way." Amane nodded. "Good for me, I guess."<p></p>
        "Heh-heh, he really worked hard, ya know," Itsuki interjected. "Studying during breaks<p></p>
        and everything."<p></p>
        "…Ah, well—"<p></p>
        "If you worked that hard, shouldn't you give yourself a reward?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        "I… guess so."<p></p>
        Recalling the reward that Mahiru had promised him caused Amane to experience an<p></p>
        indescribable surge of emotion.<p></p>
        She had promised to let him lie in her lap and to clean his ears. He had done so much<p></p>
        to erase the thought from his mind that he had genuinely forgotten about it, but she'd<p></p>
        said she would do it if he made it into the top ten.<p></p>
        He could always decline, but… there was no way he could bring himself to reject such<p></p>
        an opportunity, if the girl he liked wanted to pamper him like that.<p></p>
        "…Speaking of which, congratulations on the top spot. Shouldn't you be the one<p></p>
        treating yourself?"<p></p>
        "I suppose so. But it's not good to pamper oneself too much."<p></p>
        "But you're already so strict with yourself that I think you could stand to be a little<p></p>
        indulgent. Well, that's not for me to say, though."<p></p>
        Now that they were on the subject, Amane realized that he would be receiving<p></p>
        something special from Mahiru, but he had nothing to give back, and he wondered<p></p>
        what he should do.<p></p>
        On the other hand, he had no idea what he could offer her, so he would have to ask<p></p>
        about it after they got home.<p></p>
        Looking at Mahiru wearing her angelic smile, Itsuki quietly whispered to Amane,<p></p>
        "How about you reward her?"<p></p>
        Amane didn't need to be told twice, and he made a mental note to ask her about it<p></p>
        when they got home.<p></p>
        "Huh? A reward for me?"<p></p>
        When Amane posed the question to Mahiru as she was preparing dinner at home with<p></p>
        her apron on, she turned around with a puzzled expression on her face.<p></p>
        Amane hadn't been able to settle down, remembering the devilish smile she'd put on<p></p>
        the other day and thinking about the reward that was probably waiting for him after<p></p>
        dinner. But Mahiru hadn't seemed to notice, and now her expression showed that his<p></p>
        question was entirely unexpected.<p></p>
        "There's not really anything specific that I want, but…"<p></p>
        "Or something you want me to do…?"<p></p>
        "You do for me? Hmm, let me think. I guess I'd like you to cut that cucumber thinly<p></p>
        with the slicer."<p></p>
        "That's not what I mean… Well, if there isn't anything, you don't have to force yourself<p></p>
        to answer, you know."<p></p>
        Amane had a feeling she wasn't taking his question seriously, but he didn't want to<p></p>
        push too hard, so he backed down easily.<p></p>
        If Mahiru really didn't need anything, that was fine, but if there was something she'd<p></p>
        like him to do, and it was within Amane's capabilities, he intended to grant her<p></p>
        request.<p></p>
        For the time being, she'd said she wanted him to feed the cucumber into the slicer, so<p></p>
        he washed his hands and cut it thinly, but this was just helping her out rather than a<p></p>
        reward.<p></p>
        "Rub some salt on that and set it aside."<p></p>
        "Yes, ma'am… Is there really nothing more?"<p></p>
        "Not really. I'm content with how things are at the moment… And anyway, I think that<p></p>
        I'll be able to fulfill my one wish by myself."<p></p>
        "The wish you really want granted?"<p></p>
        "What do you think that is?"<p></p>
        Amane looked up from the slicer and saw Mahiru smiling gently.<p></p>
        For a second, her expression looked like the devilish grin she had worn the other day,<p></p>
        and he couldn't bear to look directly at her, so he dropped his eyes back down to the<p></p>
        countertop.<p></p>
        "…I d-don't know."<p></p>
        "Exactly. So don't worry about it. I'm happy as is." 1<p></p>
        Amane could sense the smile in her voice.<p></p>
        Mahiru went back to cooking, giving off an air like she wasn't going to let Amane<p></p>
        investigate any further. Amane didn't know what to do, so he just kept on thinly slicing<p></p>
        the cucumber.<p></p>
        "All right, lie down, Amane."<p></p>
        After dinner was over, the dreaded reward time arrived.<p></p>
        As if it was the most natural thing in the world, Mahiru sat down on one side of the<p></p>
        sofa and smiled at him as she patted her knees. Amane was at a loss for words.<p></p>
        Mahiru's outfit for the day was shorts with black tights, so he would technically be<p></p>
        lying in her clothed lap, but only an incredibly thin layer of fabric separated him from<p></p>
        her skin.<p></p>
        To make matters worse, she had taken a bath after getting home today, and her whole<p></p>
        body smelled wonderful.<p></p>
        It would be suicide for Amane to lie in her lap in such a risky situation.<p></p>
        "…No, um—"<p></p>
        "You don't have to if you don't want to, but isn't this what you asked for?"<p></p>
        "I-it is what I wished for, but the thing is, now that it's actually happening, I'm nervous,<p></p>
        like… i-it's embarrassing, you know?"<p></p>
        "Well then, why did you ask for it?"<p></p>
        "Th-that must have been male instincts or something."<p></p>
        "Well, you can follow those male instincts, it's fine, but… this is your reward for 1<p></p>
        working so hard. You don't need to be shy, okay? I'm going to spoil you a lot."<p></p>
        Mahiru patted her lap again, and Amane gulped.<p></p>
        It had gotten quite warm lately, so her tights were thinner than before.<p></p>
        He could just barely see the color of her skin through the sheer material, and it stirred<p></p>
        up some strong emotions.<p></p>
        Even if her thighs were covered by the tights, the smooth beauty of her slender legs<p></p>
        was on display, luring Amane in.<p></p>
        It probably wasn't Mahiru's intention at all, but the way she was dressed that day was<p></p>
        going to be the death of him.<p></p>
        Rightfully, he should have somehow found a way to decline her offer and devise a<p></p>
        peaceful way out for his heart and soul, but under the pretext of a reward, Amane's<p></p>
        "male instincts" had gotten him into this mess.<p></p>
        Gingerly, he sat down beside Mahiru and lowered his head onto her lap.<p></p>
        He had experienced this once before, and just as he remembered, her legs were very<p></p>
        soft. Since the fabric separating him from her was even thinner than it had been last<p></p>
        time, the texture and warmth of her skin came through clearly, and Amane felt his<p></p>
        heart squeeze tightly.<p></p>
        He wasn't sure where to look, so he faced upward for the time being and saw Mahiru<p></p>
        smiling down at him.<p></p>
        His view of her face, however, was partially obscured by something… or, rather, two 6<p></p>
        somethings. It was only May, but the temperature had been rising, and the shirt that<p></p>
        Mahiru was wearing was also quite thin. On top of that, the material followed the lines<p></p>
        of her body closely, highlighting her shapely figure beneath the fine cloth.<p></p>
        Amane had to turn over. If he stayed like that, he was going to explode from shame.<p></p>
        "All right, I'm going to clean your ears now."<p></p>
        Completely unaware of Amane's inner distress, Mahiru announced this with a smile.<p></p>
        She sounded somewhat excited. Mahiru reached for the ear pick and tissues that were<p></p>
        sitting on the table, and something soft pressed down on the side of his head. 3<p></p>
        (?!)<p></p>
        Sirens blared in Amane's mind, but Mahiru didn't seem to notice. She quickly grabbed<p></p>
        the ear pick and sat back up. Amane's heart was pounding as he felt the weight of her<p></p>
        soft body. Mentally, he was no longer prepared to handle an ear cleaning.<p></p>
        "Now, hold still," Mahiru whispered in a soothing voice, and she gently fixed his head<p></p>
        in place with one hand.<p></p>
        She reminded him not to move while she was cleaning his ears, but Amane found it<p></p>
        very difficult to stay still, for several reasons.<p></p>
        Even so, there was no way that he was going to struggle against her, so he stayed<p></p>
        obediently still and stared hard at the side of the table as something rigid was slowly<p></p>
        inserted into his ear hole.<p></p>
        He got chills for a moment. He was more sensitive where his skin was thinner. Amane<p></p>
        never felt ticklish when he cleaned his own ears, but when Mahiru was doing it, he got<p></p>
        a strange feeling, probably because he wasn't in control… and because it was exciting<p></p>
        to know that it was the girl he loved who was doing it.<p></p>
        He knew that Mahiru was going to do a careful job because of her personality, but<p></p>
        somehow having her oh-so-gently clean out his ear was kind of ticklish.<p></p>
        It was a little too tingly to really be pleasant, but at the same time, it had an unusual<p></p>
        appeal that ignited certain desires.<p></p>
        At the very least, there was an indescribable niceness to it, pleasant enough that he<p></p>
        was not going to resist having his ears cleaned like this.<p></p>
        "It doesn't hurt, does it?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
        "Mm… it doesn't hurt. It feels good."<p></p>
        "Oh really? I'm glad. I've heard that this is supposed to be romantic for guys, but… well,<p></p>
        does this feel romantic for you?"<p></p>
        "…A little, I guess."<p></p>
        "Well, you are a guy, after all."<p></p>
        "Have I given you any reason to doubt it?"<p></p>
        If Amane wasn't a guy, he wouldn't be writhing in agony on the inside, and he wouldn't<p></p>
        be so excited by the softness of her skin. As it was, he couldn't help getting flustered<p></p>
        being held close and pampered by the person he loved.<p></p>
        "Heh-heh, it's because you're such a gentleman, Amane. I didn't think you had much<p></p>
        interest."<p></p>
        "On the assumption that I am a gentleman, what I want and what I do are very<p></p>
        different. You ought to be careful; there are men who will smile to your face, then<p></p>
        attack you when you're alone."<p></p>
        "By that logic, you wouldn't really be a man then, would you?"<p></p>
        Amane felt like he had just been called out and bit his lip unhappily. That said, it didn't<p></p>
        seem like Mahiru had meant it as an insult. She continued peacefully with her cleaning.<p></p>
        "Here, Amane, turn over. I want to do the other side."<p></p>
        Even as he frowned harder, Amane turned and presented the opposite ear. Facing her<p></p>
        belly, however, was a new kind of penance. If he looked down, he would see her shorts,<p></p>
        and that wouldn't be good, so he had no option but to stare docilely at her stomach.<p></p>
        Amane wasn't sure if this was heaven or hell.<p></p>
        It would probably be heavenly if he could be honest about his desires, but as long as<p></p>
        he was stuck between what he wanted and what he knew was right, it was like he was<p></p>
        plunging one foot right into hell.<p></p>
        "…Amane, you've been kind of trembling since we started, but…"<p></p>
        "Please don't pay any attention to that."<p></p>
        There was no way he could even begin to tell her what he was feeling inside. After all,<p></p>
        if he said any of it out loud, Mahiru would definitely pull away from him.<p></p>
        So there was nothing to be done but obediently accept the ear cleaning and hide his<p></p>
        desires at all costs. This angel, pampering him innocently with no ulterior motives,<p></p>
        was a frightening creature.<p></p>
        Mahiru seemed to have some questions about Amane's behavior, but he was facing her<p></p>
        and couldn't make eye contact, so she gave up on investigating further and went back<p></p>
        to cleaning his ear.<p></p>
        Feeling an inexpressible pleasantness and a ticklish sensation, Amane closed his eyes<p></p>
        and waited for it to be over.<p></p>
        Whenever he opened his eyes, he felt slightly guilty about what was happening, so he<p></p>
        kept them shut. But without his vision, his other senses seemed to become more acute.<p></p>
        He inhaled her sweet smell, as well as the scents of her shampoo and body wash, and<p></p>
        he felt the softness of her thighs. He was beside himself. 1<p></p>
        He couldn't stop thinking about how amazing it would be if he could have his fill of<p></p>
        these sensations without holding back.<p></p>
        "Amane, when I'm done with your ears, can I play with your hair?"<p></p>
        "…If you want."<p></p>
        If he escaped soon, he wouldn't have to experience this conflict any longer. However,<p></p>
        Amane was still a guy, and if a girl was going to let him continue lying in her lap, he<p></p>
        wasn't going to argue. Even as he felt conflicted over wanting her to stop and wanting<p></p>
        her to do more, in the end, he gave in to his desires. It made him realize that in many<p></p>
        ways, he was very weak willed.<p></p>
        Mahiru gave every indication of being pleased by Amane's consent.<p></p>
        "I'm almost finished, okay?" she said as she carefully scraped out his ear.<p></p>
        Ah, over already? Amane thought, feeling just a little bit disappointed, suffering lonely<p></p>
        agony yet again.<p></p>
        But he didn't let it show on his face or in his movements.<p></p>
        The slightly ticklish yet pleasant feeling came to an end as Mahiru pulled out the ear<p></p>
        cleaning tool.<p></p>
        In its place came a different lovely sensation as Mahiru's fingers slipped smoothly<p></p>
        through his hair.<p></p>
        "All right, all done."<p></p>
        Mahiru combed through his hair with gentle hands as if she was comforting a child,<p></p>
        and Amane simultaneously felt embarrassed and like he wanted to surrender himself<p></p>
        to her entirely.<p></p>
        He knew that if it came down to it, the latter feeling was stronger, and a silent groan<p></p>
        threatened to escape his lips.<p></p>
        Mahiru's intention had been to pamper him thoroughly as a reward, and he was<p></p>
        definitely getting spoiled.<p></p>
        Part of him wanted to fight against Mahiru, who seemed to be enjoying her chance to<p></p>
        indulge Amane just as she had promised. Though it felt so good that any willpower he<p></p>
        had was uprooted entirely, leaving him utterly helpless to resist.<p></p>
        …I'm getting spoiled…<p></p>
        He was getting his head caressed by her tender hands while fully savoring her<p></p>
        feminine scent and warmth. It didn't sound like such a big deal when he put it into<p></p>
        words, but it felt incredibly good and left him practically euphoric. Amane could<p></p>
        imagine losing himself if he were allowed to enjoy these kinds of pleasures every day.<p></p>
        The thought had a certain appeal to it.<p></p>
        When Amane let out a sigh and relaxed his muscles, he heard a quiet giggle.<p></p>
        "You're like a pampered little boy, for once," Mahiru softly teased.<p></p>
        "…Whose fault is that?"<p></p>
        "My fault." Mahiru giggled sweetly and swept her fingers through his hair again. "I<p></p>
        always want to dote on you, because I want an excuse to touch you. Your hair feels so<p></p>
        nice to brush."<p></p>
        "…Really?"<p></p>
        "Yes. It's smooth and glossy. How do you get your hair to do that…?"<p></p>
        "…I just use the shampoo my mom recommended."<p></p>
        Shihoko had been very insistent about making sure he didn't neglect and damage his<p></p>
        fine hair. Subsequently, Amane used shampoo and conditioner found in beauty salons,<p></p>
        the kind that boasted about being good for your lustrous locks. He didn't hate the scent<p></p>
        of it, and he liked the feeling when he ran his fingers through his hair after it dried, so<p></p>
        he kept using the product.<p></p>
        "You should talk, your hair is super smooth, Mahiru."<p></p>
        He gathered a tuft of the flaxen strands into his hand, and it felt even softer and<p></p>
        smoother than his.<p></p>
        Of course, the girl had silkier, glossier hair; Amane's couldn't compete. Mahiru's had a<p></p>
        texture that made him want to touch it forever, and it had a clean, soapy scent that<p></p>
        wasn't overly strong. It was irresistible.<p></p>
        "I think this every time I pat your head, but you must take a lot of care in looking after<p></p>
        your hair."<p></p>
        "…Well, I've never been negligent about it."<p></p>
        "I can tell. By the way, I've been touching your head whenever I like, but… is that all<p></p>
        right? They say that a woman's hair is her life, and all that."<p></p>
        "…I like it when you touch me, Amane." 5<p></p>
        Amane was glad that she couldn't see his face, because he was sure his expression<p></p>
        contorted into something strange when Mahiru said those words.<p></p>
        Shame, delight, confusion, panic… If Mahiru had seen all those strong emotions<p></p>
        written on his face, she probably would have started to distrust him. 3<p></p>
        I get carried away because she says things like that.<p></p>
        Unable to say anything out loud, Amane tried to return to his normal expression. He<p></p>
        closed his eyes and sighed.<p></p>
        When he opened his eyes, Mahiru's shirt was right in front of him. 2<p></p>
        Apparently, he had fallen asleep again—his consciousness had drifted away on a<p></p>
        cushion of comfort and joy. Though he had no idea how long he'd slept, and that made<p></p>
        him anxious.<p></p>
        The hand combing his hair had stopped.<p></p>
        He sat up timidly and saw that Mahiru was leaning back against the sofa, breathing<p></p>
        heavily in her sleep.<p></p>
        "Defenseless," Amane mumbled at Mahiru, whose gentle breaths were rhythmically<p></p>
        rising and falling, then checked the clock and felt his cheek twitch.<p></p>
        It was an hour before midnight. He had been lying in Mahiru's lap since nine, after they<p></p>
        had finished cleaning up dinner and doing other household chores. Which meant that<p></p>
        he had been in the same position for almost two hours straight.<p></p>
        Mahiru had probably fallen asleep after being stuck on the couch for so long. Amane<p></p>
        knew that she wouldn't have been able to bring herself to move and disturb him, so<p></p>
        she had just nodded off where she sat.<p></p>
        He thought she ought to be more vigilant, since she was in a guy's apartment, but he<p></p>
        was the one who'd fallen asleep in her lap in the first place, so he bore some<p></p>
        responsibility.<p></p>
        He gazed at Mahiru's sleeping face, wondering what he should do, and decided for the<p></p>
        time being to go ahead and take a bath.<p></p>
        Mahiru had already taken hers for the evening, but Amane hadn't taken his yet. Even<p></p>
        if he was going to wake her up, it was better to let her sleep for now and get his bath<p></p>
        out of the way. There was also the possibility that Mahiru would wake up on her own<p></p>
        while he was bathing.<p></p>
        With that decided, Amane hurriedly went back to his room to get a change of clothes.<p></p>
        Once Amane finished his bath, he checked the living room and sighed softly.<p></p>
        As before, Mahiru was completely submerged in the depths of sleep and hadn't stirred,<p></p>
        even with the noise from the hair dryer.<p></p>
        "Mahiru, wake up," Amane said, and gently shook her the shoulder. She was still fast<p></p>
        asleep. Her head slumped to the side, showing she was truly unconscious, so for the<p></p>
        time being, Amane propped her back up.<p></p>
        He figured it must have been tiring, sitting there with his head in her lap for so long,<p></p>
        and she had probably nodded off. For now, it was clear that she wouldn't wake up any<p></p>
        time soon.<p></p>
        I feel like this happened last time, too…<p></p>
        It must have been around the end of last year. He remembered lending Mahiru his own<p></p>
        bed after she inadvertently fell asleep.<p></p>
        Amane had a feeling they were headed down the same path this time as well.<p></p>
        He shook her again, more forcefully, and called her name, but she didn't wake up.<p></p>
        He heard a quiet, little groan, but it was more like a snore than words.<p></p>
        This wasn't the first time that Amane had seen Mahiru asleep and defenseless, and he<p></p>
        couldn't help but wonder, again, whether it was all right for her to have this much faith<p></p>
        in him.<p></p>
        Cursing his luck, Amane poked Mahiru's cheek, but she didn't stir. He was only met<p></p>
        with the feeling of her smooth and soft skin. His thumb traced a path down her cheek,<p></p>
        stroking it gently.<p></p>
        When he reached her slightly slack lips, he found the texture to be even softer and<p></p>
        more supple. They reminded him of ripe fruit and looked like they would taste sweet.<p></p>
        It wouldn't have been impossible for him to taste that sweetness in that moment,<p></p>
        when she was this vulnerable. He could have enjoyed that delicious fruit and savored<p></p>
        it as he pleased.<p></p>
        But Amane's self-control, and the knowledge that he would never recover if Mahiru<p></p>
        rejected him, kept him back. Yet he couldn't stop touching her altogether. Amane<p></p>
        laughed at himself for being such a coward, and he stared at Mahiru, whose beautiful<p></p>
        sleeping face was so generously exposed.<p></p>
        She doesn't even know how I feel…<p></p>
        Mahiru probably had no idea how anxious he got when she was overly careless like<p></p>
        this.<p></p>
        Unconsciously, Amane let out a huge sigh, gently stroked Mahiru's defenseless,<p></p>
        sleeping face, and chuckled quietly.<p></p>
        Amane felt like he was being a shameful wimp, even more than usual. On the other<p></p>
        hand, he was also convinced that his cowardice was what had allowed him to win<p></p>
        Mahiru's trust.<p></p>
        It occurred to him that if he had gained her trust to this degree, he might be on the<p></p>
        way to getting her to like him.<p></p>
        Even if he wanted to confess his feelings, he was too much of a weakling, too anxious<p></p>
        about opening up to her.<p></p>
        "…If I could simply tell you I love you, I wouldn't have any worries," he grumbled 2<p></p>
        quietly.<p></p>
        With the pad of his thumb, Amane gently stroked her tender lips and sighed.<p></p>
        The fact that the girl he loved trusted him this much and was here in this vulnerable<p></p>
        state felt gratifying and lovely, but it was also torture. Before long, he was going to have<p></p>
        to get her to understand the conflict he was feeling.<p></p>
        He made up his mind to scold her a little bit when she woke up, then grabbed her by<p></p>
        the shoulders and shook her.<p></p>
        "Mahiru, wake up. It's time to go home."<p></p>
        He shook her kind of hard, to prompt her to wake up.<p></p>
        He could have stared at her adorable sleeping face forever, but if he looked too long,<p></p>
        he was going to want to do something, and he wouldn't be able to sleep with her here<p></p>
        anyway.<p></p>
        He had reluctantly allowed her to stay over several times before, or maybe it would be<p></p>
        more accurate to say he had lent her his bed. He knew that, as a last resort, he could<p></p>
        let her sleep in his room.<p></p>
        If possible, he wanted her to return to her own apartment. If Mahiru slept in Amane's<p></p>
        bed, it would smell extremely sweet and nice, and that would cause him all sorts of<p></p>
        difficulties until her scent faded, and he wanted to avoid that if he could.<p></p>
        With that one goal, Amane shook Mahiru and gently slapped her soft cheeks. With<p></p>
        extremely sluggish movements, she raised her eyelids with a flutter of her long<p></p>
        eyelashes.<p></p>
        However, the vibrant caramel-coloured eyes that peeked out from behind them seemed<p></p>
        somewhat vacant and unfocused. He couldn't tell where she was looking, and her<p></p>
        bleary eyes started to slip listlessly back behind the curtain of her eyelids.<p></p>
        "Mahiru, I'm begging you, please wake up. Go sleep at home."<p></p>
        "…Unh…"<p></p>
        "Don't groan, just say yes."<p></p>
        "…Yes…"<p></p>
        She answered him in a mumbling voice that didn't sound like she understood the<p></p>
        situation, so with his cheek twitching, Amane tried even harder to rouse her back to<p></p>
        consciousness, shaking her harder but not so hard as to rattle her brain.<p></p>
        It must have had some effect, because Mahiru showed him her eyes again, but—this<p></p>
        time, she fell forward, directly against Amane, and buried her face in his chest.<p></p>
        In a quiet, muffled voice, she mumbled, "Smells nice," as she rubbed her cheek against<p></p>
        him. A small sound squeaked out from the back of Amane's throat when he heard her<p></p>
        moaning.<p></p>
        Seriously, this girl is…<p></p>
        He tried to tear himself away from her slack body, so defenseless that he had to<p></p>
        wonder if she wasn't doing it on purpose at this point, but he couldn't. At the same<p></p>
        time, he felt the urge to stay just as he was, to wrap his arms around her and dote on<p></p>
        her. It probably would have been best to immediately pull away and go bang his head<p></p>
        on the wall.<p></p>
        Biting his lip hard, Amane grabbed Mahiru's shoulders and slowly pushed her away<p></p>
        from his body, and she looked up at him blankly, with dazed, spiritless eyes.<p></p>
        "Mahiru, it's late already; how about you go home? We've got school tomorrow, you<p></p>
        know, so if you oversleep, you'll have a hard time. I'll walk you to your door."<p></p>
        Mahiru only lived next door, but she was definitely out of it, so he felt anxious about<p></p>
        her leaving the apartment.<p></p>
        Whether Mahiru had understood him or not, she said, "Good niii…" in a lifeless voice<p></p>
        and staggered to her feet, which was a good sign. She looked like she might fall right<p></p>
        back down on the floor, so Amane ended up rushing over to support her.<p></p>
        She was wiped out from the tests, and on top of that, she had let him lie in her lap for<p></p>
        a long time. Sitting still for so long must have been physically taxing. Sleepiness was<p></p>
        bearing down on her, and she could hardly stand.<p></p>
        …No way around it.<p></p>
        Amane was sure that even if he lent her his shoulder and somehow got her as far as<p></p>
        her door, she would still fall flat on her face the second she walked in.<p></p>
        He sighed softly and gazed into Mahiru's face as she leaned her full weight on him.<p></p>
        "Mahiru, you've reached your limit, so I'm going to take you to your room. Can I borrow<p></p>
        your keys? I'm going with you into your apartment."<p></p>
        He felt nervous about going into a girl's apartment and didn't like having to ask Mahiru<p></p>
        for permission when she was obviously passed out. However, he figured that if she had<p></p>
        to choose between that and staying over in a boy's apartment, she would probably<p></p>
        prefer the former, no matter how many times she had done the latter already. Amane<p></p>
        also knew he would be able to relax and sleep better if Mahiru was at home tucked<p></p>
        into her own bed, instead of his.<p></p>
        He had roused Mahiru enough to ask for her permission, which slightly eased his<p></p>
        discomfort.<p></p>
        In response to his question, Mahiru slowly nodded her head.<p></p>
        After confirming her consent, Amane pulled the keys out of Mahiru's pocket, trying<p></p>
        his best not to make contact with her hip while he did so, and cradled her in his arms.<p></p>
        Mahiru must have been very tired, because she leaned into him and fell half asleep<p></p>
        again. If Amane didn't get her back home soon, she was going to fall asleep right in his<p></p>
        arms.<p></p>
        He stepped out of his apartment, trying his best not to make much noise. He walked<p></p>
        over to Mahiru's door and, still holding her, carefully unlocked it. Then he slowly<p></p>
        carried her into the apartment.<p></p>
        "…Pardon the intrusion."<p></p>
        The interior was, of course, laid out the same way as his. Amane knew it had the same<p></p>
        floor plan, so he also knew where the bedroom ought to be.<p></p>
        But his heart started pounding the second he stepped in. Mahiru's apartment had a<p></p>
        sweet, invigorating smell, and it was decorated differently from his. Her meticulous<p></p>
        and tidy personality was evident. The flooring was polished to a high shine, and he<p></p>
        couldn't spot any dirt worth mentioning. There was a mirror and some flowers sitting<p></p>
        on the shoe cubby that stood against the wall, which gave the place a subdued, yet<p></p>
        bright and brilliant atmosphere.<p></p>
        Amane glanced into the living room beyond the entryway. He got the impression that<p></p>
        an adult had decorated it, with a collection of clean and cheerful furniture in basic<p></p>
        tones of soft white and pale blue to go with the natural colors of the wood floor.<p></p>
        Despite that, the apartment didn't really look like anyone lived in it. It showed hardly<p></p>
        any signs of habitation. Besides sleeping and going to school, Mahiru had recently<p></p>
        been spending most of her time over at Amane's apartment, so in a certain sense, it<p></p>
        was almost like she wasn't living there.<p></p>
        After having that realization, Amane quietly opened the door to the room he assumed<p></p>
        was her bedroom and stepped inside.<p></p>
        It was the first time in his life that he had been inside a girl's bedroom. It was such a<p></p>
        lovely space that Amane thought other girls would get upset if they had to live up to<p></p>
        this standard.<p></p>
        Just like the living room, the basic colors were white and light blue, but it was fancier<p></p>
        than the living room. He would best describe it as tidy and stylish.<p></p>
        Amane also thought that it looked more lived-in and showcased Mahiru's personality<p></p>
        more. The place was well-kept, as was Mahiru's habit. On top of the desk, next to her<p></p>
        textbooks and cookbooks, sat the stuffed animal that she had won at the game center<p></p>
        when Amane had taken her there.<p></p>
        Also, the stuffed bear that he had gifted her for her last birthday was there, just as<p></p>
        immaculate as on the day he'd given it. It was sitting beside her pillow on the bed, and<p></p>
        it now had a navy-blue ribbon tied inconspicuously around it, mostly concealed by the<p></p>
        original ribbon that had always been there.<p></p>
        Amane had heard that she treasured the stuffed bear, but seeing in person that she<p></p>
        had it sitting there by her pillow, he felt his cheeks grow hot.<p></p>
        Imagining her sleeping with it every night was almost too much to stand.<p></p>
        Biting the inside of his cheek in a desperate attempt to keep it together, Amane slowly<p></p>
        lowered Mahiru onto the bed and covered her with the blanket. He was once again<p></p>
        grateful that she had worn shorts with tights today.<p></p>
        Maybe because she felt the sensation of her body sinking into the bed, Mahiru, who<p></p>
        had been almost entirely asleep, opened her bleary eyes a little.<p></p>
        Smiling in spite of himself at her sleepy expression, Amane got down on his knees and<p></p>
        gently stroked Mahiru's head with the palm of his hand.<p></p>
        "You're home now. I'll give your key back later, so don't worry about that."<p></p>
        She had touched him plenty that day, so he figured it would be all right to touch her a<p></p>
        little bit, too. As he scooped up a piece of hair that had fallen across her face to move<p></p>
        it out of the way, he poked at her supple cheek, and she giggled like it tickled and put<p></p>
        on a smile that was several times softer than usual.<p></p>
        Without pause, with sleepy, bleary eyes, she patted the bed beside her. 4<p></p>
        "…You too, Amane…" 3<p></p>
        He froze as he considered what the rest of that sentence could mean.<p></p>
        She seemed to be telling him to sleep there. Maybe even that she wanted him as a body<p></p>
        pillow.<p></p>
        …She doesn't mean that; she doesn't know what she's saying.<p></p>
        Amane tried to persuade himself of this as he pushed back against certain desires that<p></p>
        had momentarily threatened to lure him astray.<p></p>
        He was afraid that if he lingered, Mahiru would say something unthinkable, so he<p></p>
        impatiently stroked her head very gently, like he was putting a child to bed, and lulled<p></p>
        her to sleep.<p></p>
        "I'm going home now. Okay?"<p></p>
        "…No."<p></p>
        "There's no way I'm hanging around in a girl's bedroom. You'll absolutely regret asking<p></p>
        once you wake up. I can already see you beating me with your pillow."<p></p>
        If Amane joined her in bed, not only would he be unable to get a wink of sleep, but<p></p>
        once she woke up, Mahiru would be confused and would turn bright red. Then, to hide<p></p>
        her embarrassment, she was almost guaranteed to whack him with her pillow.<p></p>
        He could also anticipate that afterward, things would get awkward between them, so<p></p>
        for the sake of Amane's sanity and the next day's mood, he had to use all his willpower<p></p>
        to get out of there.<p></p>
        Mahiru was still dozing off, but seemed to be resisting sleep and Amane's frantic<p></p>
        attempts to pacify her.<p></p>
        In that case—Amane grabbed the bear from beside her and pushed it against her face.<p></p>
        "This guy says he'll sleep here instead of me, so relax and go to bed."<p></p>
        It appeared she had been keeping the stuffed animal close when she slept, so Amane<p></p>
        decided to use it to lull her to sleep.<p></p>
        He untangled his fingers from her soft hair and gently, gently whispered good night.<p></p>
        Mahiru groaned in an adorable voice and embraced the stuffed bear in front of her.<p></p>
        She looked innocent and childlike, a far cry from her usual prim and proper act, and<p></p>
        so sweet that he wanted to caress her again.<p></p>
        She was so charming that he might have spontaneously snapped a picture, if he'd had<p></p>
        his smartphone on hand, and he felt relieved that he hadn't brought anything with him<p></p>
        other than the key to his apartment. It would be very inappropriate to photograph a<p></p>
        sleeping girl's face. He knew it was weird to even consider it.<p></p>
        At last, Mahiru's eyelids, rimmed with long eyelashes, covered the entirety of her<p></p>
        eyeballs, and she started breathing peacefully in her sleep.<p></p>
        Amane sighed quietly, careful not to wake her again.<p></p>
        …She's too careless. That was terrifying.<p></p>
        Amane knew that she only behaved this way because she was with him. That didn't<p></p>
        change the fact that it was difficult for him to watch the girl he loved let her guard<p></p>
        down so completely like that.<p></p>
        Praising himself for resisting temptation, Amane left Mahiru's room as silently as he<p></p>
        could and walked right out of her apartment.<p></p>
        He knew that it would take quite a bit of time before he was able to sleep that night.<p></p>
        "G-good morning…"<p></p>
        "M-morning…"<p></p>
        Inevitably, the next day, the two of them each felt too awkward to look at the other.<p></p>
        Mahiru almost never came to his apartment this early, but naturally, given what had<p></p>
        happened, she had come over to talk.<p></p>
        Amane had had difficulty falling asleep after everything that had happened yesterday,<p></p>
        and it didn't make it any easier when she suddenly appeared first thing in the morning.<p></p>
        He recalled the pleasant sensation of lying in her lap, the rich fruity scent, and the full<p></p>
        softness that had come down on his head in the middle of it. Then the memory of<p></p>
        Mahiru's apartment, which he had basically entered on his own, with permission at<p></p>
        least, surfaced in his mind. Her cherubic sleeping face and sweet pleading voice were<p></p>
        impossible to forget.<p></p>
        He had spent the night tossing and turning in bed, tortured by how lovely she had<p></p>
        looked while hugging the teddy bear.<p></p>
        Writhing in agony, he had just finally managed to go to sleep when morning arrived,<p></p>
        but he was awakened by his alarm, resulting in his current state of exhaustion.<p></p>
        Mahiru, on the other hand, looked fresh and had a good complexion, as if she had slept<p></p>
        just fine. She seemed very anxious, though, and constantly fidgeted like she was trying<p></p>
        hard to conceal her embarrassment.<p></p>
        Amane had been just about to eat breakfast when Mahiru had barged in. Now he was<p></p>
        stuck, unsure of how to proceed.<p></p>
        Her reward had been too exhilarating, and now that he knew that feeling, he found it<p></p>
        hard to look at Mahiru directly. To make matters worse, Mahiru didn't seem to realize<p></p>
        what had happened, so feelings of guilt weighed on his chest, in addition to the shame.<p></p>
        "…Wh-what are you doing here in the morning? Oh, I know, you came to get your key<p></p>
        back, right? Sorry for taking it home with me."<p></p>
        "Ah, no, I… well, there is that, but that's not why I'm here."<p></p>
        No matter how close they might be, Amane felt it was wrong to take home a girl's<p></p>
        house key. He was already feeling bad about setting foot in her apartment, even though<p></p>
        he hadn't really been able to avoid it.<p></p>
        …As I suspected, she's mad that I saw her bedroom.<p></p>
        Amane remembered her room being very neat and tidy, but he couldn't fault her for<p></p>
        being upset that he had rudely taken a look while she was basically unconscious. If<p></p>
        he'd happened to see her underwear or something hung up to dry, Mahiru probably<p></p>
        wouldn't have looked at him or spoken to him for a while, and Amane was sure he<p></p>
        would have had to avoid her for some time as well.<p></p>
        Thankfully he hadn't caught sight of anything like that.<p></p>
        "C-can I ask you one thing?" Mahiru inquired.<p></p>
        "Sure."<p></p>
        "…O-on top of my desk, there should have been a picture frame, but…"<p></p>
