            Amane Fujimiya’s neighbour in the apartment he lives in is the school’s number one lovable angel:... Read more Amane Fujimiya’s neighbour in the apartment he lives in is the school’s number one lovable angel: Excellent and with a level of beauty that can only be described as angelic — Mahiru Shiina. Amane, an ordinary student who doesn’t stand out, is her neighbour, but until now, they didn’t interact with each other. After meeting the soggy angel in the rain:«I’m returning what I borrowed. By the way, clean up your room. It’s filthy.»«None of your business.»A relationship with a sharp-tongued angel begins, starting with handing over an umbrella. From catching a cold and having someone take care of you, to making a meal for someone because they neglected their health, to joint work (cleaning rooms)… Collapse Adapted to Manga, Anti-social Protagonist, Apartment Life, Appearance Changes, Beautiful Female Lead, Calm Protagonist, Caring Protagonist, Clingy Lover, Cold Protagonist, Complex Family Relationships, Cooking, Couple Growth, Cute Story, Dense Protagonist, Devoted Love Interests, Doting Love Interests, Doting Parents, Friendship, Handsome Male Lead, Heartwarming, Kind Love Interests, Lazy Protagonist, Living Alone, Male Protagonist, Mature Protagonist, Modern Day, Part-Time Job, Past Plays a Big Role, Popular Love Interests, R-15 Скучная история больше 3 глав не смог прочесть даже некоторые повседневные романы и то лучше It's pure sugar.. Beware of getting diabetes. The fluff parts sweetened after they acknowledge each other and became a couple. "Mahiru Shiina"Hmmmmmmmmmmmm To explain briefly: this story is about fluffy romance between two main characters Amane and Mahiru. No harem and no other BS, only pure romance. If you're tired of reading harem novels or if you're looking for one-on-one pure relationship, this novel is for you.The light hearted comedy and fluffy moments are nice; the back stories of Mahiru and Amane are really touching and quite believable and so is their reason for falling with each other. Their relationship is definitely diabetes inducing. However the story suffers from a major drawback: repetition.The story takes an extreme nose-dive after the confession and the two characters practically do nothing but repeat their earlier lifestyle and actions. They soon realize after becoming a couple that they were already doing couple like things even before dating each other. Sadly, even when the characters realize this themselves, it is the author that doesn't understand this and repeats the same sort of actions and the story then heads towards nothing but fluffy action and no plot or development of any sort.To quote another reviewer, this is basically rinse and repeat of pre-defined and over used sequence of actions between the two characters. Mahiru pouts and Amane tries to lift her mood. And then some fluffy action happens. Rinse. Repeat. Not exactly brief but i appreciate the explanation An anime adaptation just got announced. Warning...!!!!!!!! Too sweet ... Too sweet....... Every 4 lines mans calling the girl an angel, cute, beautiful, lax-coloured hair lmao, innocent, an art and way more shit, this guy isn't aloof he's a simp lmao. but hes a simp that got an angel, cute, beautiful, lax-coloured hair lmao, innocent, an art and way more shit as his gf.... Status in COO: Hiatus Oh, come fckng on! Help!!Chapter 194 to chapter 208 are not hereIf anyone knows where I can read those then please share the link/site call #panic Fixed, thanks! Woah, that was fast...Arigato~ Why do i feel sick whenever I read the confession part In a heart attack way? a throw up way? a headache way? what kind of sickness? Mentally I see, so you are disgusted. Don't worry, I am also disgusted by the confession. Can you spoil me? or just put what chapter is it. I really want to read it but my anxious ass can't f#cking focus on reading it... the confession is around 110 (<i>web-masters' note: wrong</i>) i think
