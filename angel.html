    "Amane, your sniffling's annoying."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're annoying."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The next day, it was Amane who'd ended up with the cold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As his classmate and good friend Itsuki Akazawa had pointed out, Amane had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    trying and failing to snort everything back up his nose. Trying to exhale only resulted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in a terrible, wet, burbling sound.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't sure whether it was because his nose was stuffed up or as a result of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the cold itself, but a throbbing pain was spreading across the back of his head. He had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    taken some over-the-counter medicine, but it wasn't making a dent in his symptoms<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at all. Truly, Amane was a sad sight. His congested face twisted in nasal distress as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    became well acquainted with a tissue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki looked at him, not with concern but exasperation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You were just fine yesterday, dude."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I got caught in the rain."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Aw, chin up. Wait, didn't you have an umbrella yesterday?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I gave it to someone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Naturally, there was no way that Amane could openly admit at school that he'd given<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it to Mahiru, so he kept things vague.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Incidentally, he'd caught a glimpse of Mahiru earlier that day. She'd looked rather well,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not ill at all. Amane couldn't help but laugh. Things had gotten completely flipped around.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was his own fault—he'd neglected to warm up in the bath when he'd gotten home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don'cha think you were being a little too nice, lending out your umbrella when it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pouring like that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not really. Even if I did, no point complaining about it now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And who did you give it to anyway? Who was worth catching a cold?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…A, uh, a lost little kid?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Can't really call her a kid with that body, though… Well, that and the fact that we're the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    same age. Although, her face did look kinda lost…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something clicked when Amane thought of the unusual encounter that way. Her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression had been exactly that of a lost little kid searching for their parent.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, what a kind and upstanding gentleman you are!" Itsuki laughed, unaware of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feelings bubbling up in Amane's chest as he recalled his meeting with Mahiru the day<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before. "But you know, even if you let someone borrow your umbrella or whatever, I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bet your real problem was that you got lazy and didn't warm up afterward. That's why<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you're dying."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…How do you know that?" Amane shot back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you don't exactly take good care of yourself. That much was obvious the moment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I saw your place. That's why you got sick, dumbass."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't really argue with Itsuki's friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and his room was always a total mess. What's more, he subsisted on a diet of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with him, asking him how he could live like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    caught a cold overnight.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow's Saturday, so focus on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    getting better," Itsuki advised.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I will…," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do." Itsuki's lips curled up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at his slight boast.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up. I don't need to hear that from a guy who's already got a girlfriend." Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    irritated.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As the day wore on, Amane's condition continued to deteriorate.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rougher than usual, and he felt hot.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he'd let his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not a concern, was now a source of dull agony.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane's floor, he staggered out on leaden<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    complexion vibrant and glowing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before, neatly folded and closed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn't have to, Amane reasoned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Really, you don't need to give it back," he said aloud.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's only natural to return something you borrowed…" Mahiru hesitated as soon as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she got a good look at Amane's face. "Um. You have a fever, don't you…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's got nothing to do with you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru—and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn't have been worth<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out how Amane had caught a cold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in the rain."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I said it's fine, really. It's not something you need to worry about."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    From Amane's perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self-satisfaction, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he didn't want her fussing over him now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, Mahiru didn't seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her graceful features.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…So yeah, it's all good. See ya." Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru's questioning and concern.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength<p></p>
    <p></p>
    left his body.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wouldn't break, and he wouldn't fall. Surely it would catch him, and he'd be fine.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there's no avoiding it…, Amane thought,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    resigning himself to the pain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Just as I thought; I can't leave you alone like this." Amane heard a fragile voice through<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his feverish haze. "I'll repay your favor."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    opened the door to his apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm going to help you inside. There's no other way, so please forgive the intrusion."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    descended to care for him instead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    place until it was too late. It wasn't until he saw the condition his home was in that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    regretted ever letting Mahiru enter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    main living space.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane's parents<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't about to complain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not kept especially tidy. Various items were scattered all over the living room, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "This is too pitiful to look at." The angel, Amane's savior, gave him a frank assessment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming<p></p>
    <p></p>
    appearance.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he'd known that he'd be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up a bit, but it was too late for that now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    serious cleaning sometime soon.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "First, I'm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    back. You can do that, right?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're coming back?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt<p></p>
    <p></p>
    toward her when she was soaking wet the day before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was told and started changing out of his school uniform.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's really a mess in here; there's nowhere to even step… How can anyone live like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next<p></p>
    <p></p>
    room, and felt quite ashamed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without<p></p>
    <p></p>
    realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the first thing he saw.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What time is it?" Amane asked, confused.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Seven in the evening," Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. "You slept for several hours."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    able to take a look at his surroundings.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn't have any of those at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his place, and he looked up at Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I brought it from home," she answered immediately.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks, either. Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    must have brought that over as well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru's curt answer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn't mean<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    already talking with a boy she barely knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    natural.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It's better<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to take it with something in your stomach… Are you hungry at all?" Mahiru asked gently.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm, a little bit," Amane answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you're welcome to have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Huh, you made it yourself?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is there anyone else here but me? If you don't want it, I'll eat it all alone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I'll eat it! Please let me eat it!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was caught off guard.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he'd never heard<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn't be awful.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane's sudden bow and insistence that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the side table.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'll bring it to you, so take your temperature first."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay," Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do it after I leave the room, please." There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    spied that the girl's pale cheeks were tinged red.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hadn't thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn't consider<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    accustomed to seeing much skin.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shyness almost palpable.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he'd also never had any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her like one would a distant masterpiece.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru wasn't some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    idol, and it was strangely adorable.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The two didn't have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird<p></p>
    <p></p>
    if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?" he asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-you don't have to tell me," Mahiru answered dismissively. "I'll be right back." She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because of all the clutter. Probably the latter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dangerous; she could be attacked or something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must've meant she was worried about him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    obligation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Then came a hesitant knock at the door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I've brought the porridge."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At the sound of Mahiru's concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I haven't taken my temperature yet," he called back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry, I spaced out."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few<p></p>
    <p></p>
    moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn't bad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay, I'm finished," Amane said as he put his shirt back on.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What was your temperature?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thirty-eight point three. I'll be better after I take some medicine and get some more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sleep."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won't eliminate the virus<p></p>
    <p></p>
    itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    done that intentionally because she'd thought it'd be easier on Amane's stomach.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She'd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    colds.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The dish wasn't steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hadn't brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down first.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the rice mixed easily.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here you go. It shouldn't be too hot."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm, thank you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru gave Amane a puzzled look as he received the bowl, but then he merely stared<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at the porridge while his spoon hovered over it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What is it; you want me to feed you? Sorry, but that's not on the menu," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asserted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nobody asked for that, okay? It's just… So I guess you can cook, too, huh?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I live alone, so of course I can." The girl's words stung, a heavy reminder of Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    own domestic failures. "But before you learn to cook, you should learn to clean up your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    room, Fujimiya."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, ma'am…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had quickly and thoroughly put him in his place. Amane grumbled quietly and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    scooped up some of the porridge, stuffing the spoon into his mouth in a bid to end the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    conversation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The flavor of the lightly salted rice spread across his tongue as he ate the porridge.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The mellow sourness of the pickled plums pulled it all together. It was truly a dish with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a perfect balance of flavors.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't like pickled plums that were too salty, but these had a milder taste and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a bit of sweetness. They were actually a favorite of his. Often, he liked to top green tea<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rice with pickled plums.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks for saying so. Though, really, once you've tasted one rice porridge, I think<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you've probably tasted them all." Mahiru's answer appeared indifferent, save for the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    very slightest beginnings of a smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without meaning to, Amane found himself staring at the beautiful girl's relieved<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression. Something about it seemed quite different from the more outgoing smile<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he occasionally caught her wearing at school.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Fujimiya?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry, it's nothing," he answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought it a shame that such a beautiful smile had been so fleeting, though he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kept the musing to himself. Instead, he shoveled spoonful after spoonful of porridge<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into his mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Anyhow, you rest today. And make sure to replenish your fluids. If you need to wipe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    away sweat, use this. I've put water into your washbowl, so make sure to wet it and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wring it out before wiping, okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After Amane had eaten, Mahiru diligently prepared an unopened sports drink, readied<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the bowl of water, and laid out a towel and spare cooling sheets. All had been carefully<p></p>
    <p></p>
    placed on the side table in Amane's bedroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way Mahiru was going to stay over at the home of a boy she barely knew.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wouldn't have stood for it if she'd tried. Thus, Mahiru had prepared everything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could've needed while he rested, and he was grateful for her diligence, though<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he stared at her the whole time she got everything ready.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This is an awful lot just to repay a favor. Once this is over, I guess we won't have much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reason to interact. It's a one-off thing, a freak occurrence; that's all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Well, since we won't be talking ever again, I guess it's all right to ask about that thing I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want to know.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whether from the medicine or his nap, Amane's head felt clearer, though he was still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exhausted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, there's something I've been wondering…," he started.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What is it?" Mahiru turned to look at him from where she was setting up all the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    essentials he'd need.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why were you sitting out in the rain? Did you have a fight with your boyfriend or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something?" The strange behavior that'd kicked off this whole chain of events had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been on Amane's mind since he'd first noticed it. Mahiru had been rocking back and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forth on a swing in the pouring rain. What could she have been doing there?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was precisely because Amane had been curious about Mahiru's slight resemblance<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to a lost child that he'd offered her his umbrella in the first place. He'd never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    discovered why she'd been out there in the storm to begin with, however.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had thought Mahiru had been waiting for someone, so he'd guessed that there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was a boy she was dating, even wondering if perhaps she and her boyfriend had gotten<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into an argument. In response to Amane's question, Mahiru looked at him as if she was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fed up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry, but I don't have a boyfriend, and I have no plans to get one," she replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? Why?" Amane asked almost unconsciously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Let me ask you, why did you assume I was dating someone?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "With how popular you are, I thought you'd have at least one or two boyfriends."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something about this back-and-forth made Mahiru seem much more like a normal girl<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to Amane. She was kind but strong-willed. To other people, though, he was sure she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed quite different. Mahiru was a beautiful girl who was tidy, sweet, quiet, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    humble. Her pretty face, so lovely that she was often called an angel, turned heads<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wherever she went, and her body was petite but possessed abundant curves. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    briefest sight of her instilled a strange, momentary feeling of wanting to protect her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That quality, combined with her excellent sense of style, made her an object of desire<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for many a schoolboy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    On top of all that, her grades kept her at the top of her class, and she was an all-around<p></p>
    <p></p>
    excellent athlete. What's more, Amane had just learned firsthand that she was good at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooking, too. That certainly wouldn't hurt her popularity.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just one glance was enough to know there must have been plenty of guys who were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    after her, and Amane knew for a fact that quite a few of his own classmates had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    romantic feelings for Mahiru. She could've had her pick of the litter, and it hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    occurred to him that she might not be seeing anyone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was what Amane had meant when he'd said that thing about one or two<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boyfriends, but the moment she'd heard those words, Mahiru's expression had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stiffened, if only for a moment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't have a boyfriend, and what's more, I'm not the kind of girl who would keep the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    company of several boys at once. It's absolutely out of the question."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes were so cold, they sent a shiver down Amane's spine. He realized<p></p>
    <p></p>
    immediately that he'd stepped on some kind of social land mine.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It might have been because of his sickness, but he felt a chill pass over him, and the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    room seemed drafty all of a sudden.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry, that's not what I meant. I apologize," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…No, I'm sorry for getting fired up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru bowing her head seemed to disperse the cold, tense atmosphere of the room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    More than being "fired up," Mahiru's icy reply to Amane's question had been like a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    blizzard, though he knew better than to point that out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Anyway, that's not what was going on at all. I was just trying to cool my head a bit…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    And I really am sorry that you caught a cold because you were worried about me,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine. I mean, it was my decision, after all. I feel kind of guilty about all this, actually.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I only gave you the umbrella as a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing. I'll try not to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bother you once this is all over."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was sure that Mahiru was only there to help out of some sense of obligation,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but when she heard what he had to say, she blinked a few times and gave him a curious<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look. It must have intrigued her to hear that he wouldn't be troubling her again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We don't really have any reason to interact, so it's not like it'll be a big deal. I mean,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even if you're the most beautiful girl in our grade, and a genius, and everyone calls you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an angel, I wasn't trying to hook up with you; I swear. You don't think that this was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some kind of scheme or something, do you?" Amane inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked away a little awkwardly. A bitter smile spread across her lips, as if she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been waiting for Amane to say those exact words. Finally, he realized that she wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just acting cagey. Mahiru had probably wound up in that sort of situation a few times<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before. A guy trying to get in with a beautiful girl by making her feel indebted was,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unfortunately, not unheard of.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It explained why Mahiru had been so wary of Amane that day in the rain. She hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been upset at him; she'd just been trying to protect herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It must be so irritating. Being bothered by guys you don't even like," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that's true, but…" Mahiru's voice trailed off.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Called it," quipped Amane, a little surprised to hear her admit it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So the quiet, charming, model student, the one everybody makes a big fuss over, the one<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everybody calls an angel, does have things she doesn't like. Why, she even gets annoyed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from time to time, just like the rest of us mortals. The thought gave Amane the sudden<p></p>
    <p></p>
    impression that he was seeing the real Mahiru for the first time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unfortunately, the way she glared back at Amane seemed to suggest that she was really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    regretting having ever met him. It looked like she resented him for making her reveal<p></p>
    <p></p>
    how she really felt.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Further proof that the angelic honor student has real emotions hidden deep down,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't really see the problem with that," admitted Amane. "Actually, I'm relieved. It's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nice to hear that the angel finds that stuff just as annoying as normal humans."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Please stop calling me that." Mahiru obviously hated the title others had given her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With disapproval in her eyes, she continued to gaze at Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even her displeasure seemed interesting to Amane, who smiled again and said, "Not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to worry, I won't bother you again without a good reason."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes opened wide as if his declaration had caught her by surprise. With the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    faintest whisper of a smile crossing her lips, she bowed sharply and left.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane lay in bed, staring vacantly up at the ceiling while thinking about Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though the medicine had taken effect, he was, unsurprisingly, still feeling sluggish.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he relaxed, sleep would surely claim him in no time at all. He closed his eyes and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reflected on the events of the day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No one would ever believe him if he told them that he'd been nursed back to health by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an angel with a surprisingly sharp tongue. The day's events were a secret shared only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by Amane and Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It feels kinda weird to call it a secret. It's more like it'd be a real pain to explain the whole<p></p>
    <p></p>
    story. It's just easier not to tell anybody, that's all, Amane reasoned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As he slowly lost consciousness, Amane told himself that, when tomorrow came, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and Mahiru would be nothing more than mere acquaintances again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    3 The Angel’s Generosity<p></p>
    As Amane had anticipated, he and Mahiru had returned to being nothing more than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    two people who attended the same school.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd been feeling much better the following day and had happened to run into Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    when he went out to shop at the convenience store, but they hadn't said very much to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    each other. Amane did catch that Mahiru looked a little relieved to see him well on his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    way to recovery.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Nothing changed back at school on the following Monday, either. The two were back<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to being strangers. The only tiny difference was that now, whenever they encountered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    each other on the way to school, she would greet him with a quick bow. That was all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, Amane, you feeling better?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm good, thanks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It seemed that Itsuki had also been worried about Amane. He'd been in rather bad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shape last Friday, after all. Amane's condition had been the first thing Itsuki asked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about when they saw each other outside the school building. Itsuki had even sent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane a text over the weekend: "You're not dead, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had sent back a message that he was fine, but it seemed Itsuki had only been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    half-convinced, because he let out a deep sigh of relief when he saw in person how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much better his friend was feeling.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, well, when I saw you in such bad shape, even I started to worry, man! It's all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    good if you're better now. You oughtta take better care of yourself. Start by cleaning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    your room or somethin'."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You sound like somebody else I know," Amane quipped.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing. Something happened this weekend that kind of opened my eyes. I'll clean<p></p>
    <p></p>
    my place up in a few days."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki didn't let up. "Nah, man, you gotta sort yourself out now!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane turned away in a huff. It would probably take more than half a day to clean that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mess up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Looking exasperated, Itsuki backed off a bit, saying, "I mean, you can live however you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want, ya know. But just clear a path you can actually walk through for the next time I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    come over."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'll deal with it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Wearing a sour face the whole time, Amane changed into his indoor shoes and headed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for his classroom. An extremely boisterous room caught his attention as he walked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down a hall, however, and he couldn't help but peek in.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Glancing in through a hallway window, Amane saw Mahiru, as beautiful as she'd ever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been, surrounded by her classmates.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whenever someone spoke to her, she would turn to them with a quiet smile. Everything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about her persona seemed totally different from the Mahiru he'd seen the other day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane suddenly broke out in a smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Noticing his friend's gaze, Itsuki's eyes followed the same path. He saw Mahiru and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    immediately understood.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shiina, huh? As popular as always. No surprise, given how pretty she is."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you know what they say. She's an angel. What about you, Itsuki? Think she's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cute?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I guess so. But I've got Chi, so only in a sorta aesthetic-appreciation-type way,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Quit going on about your girlfriend already."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki had a girlfriend named Chi, although that was a nickname. Her full name was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose Shirakawa.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They were an extremely close couple, madly in love with each other—it gave Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heartburn whenever he saw them together.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Although Amane was quick to dismiss the girlfriend talk, Itsuki didn't seem particularly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    offended. Amane often said things like that, so Itsuki just laughed. "You're heartless.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So lemme ask you: Do you think she's cute, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She's definitely beautiful, but that's all," answered Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How bland," Itsuki commented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She's like a flower on a high peak that my hand could never reach. I've got nothing to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    do with her. Looking is enough."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fair."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Some quirk of fate may have brought Mahiru and Amane together that other day, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they were truly destined to live in different worlds.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The idea that Amane, a self-admitted hopeless loser, and Mahiru, the beautiful
    <p></p>
    super-student who could do anything, might one day have any kind of relationship, let alone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a romantic one, was frankly ridiculous. It was a veritable impossibility.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That's right, Amane thought. There's no need to concern myself with her any further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What are you eating?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The theory that the two would never interact again was quickly disproven. Amane was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sucking down some nutritional jelly on his veranda while gazing up at the sky when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru called to him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It'd been too much of a bother to even go to the convenience store, so he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    contenting himself with the pouch of jelly he had at home while getting some air when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru unexpectedly came out onto her own veranda.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She leaned over her railing slightly, looked at the nutritional jelly pouch that was in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's mouth, and frowned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For a moment, Amane was frozen; he'd thought she was done with him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Can't you see? It's a ten-second energy-replenishment jelly," he finally answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Don't tell me that's what you're calling dinner?" Mahiru asked, incredulous.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course it is."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's all you're eating? A high school boy, with a healthy appetite?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's none of your business."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Normally, Amane would've eaten a boxed meal from the convenience store or something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    premade from the supermarket, but today, he'd neglected to pick something up for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dinner, and he didn't feel like instant ramen, so this was all he had. It probably<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wouldn't be enough, though, so he planned on having a snack later, too.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I guess I don't need to ask whether you can cook for yourself. It definitely doesn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seem like you can, at least. And yet you're living on your own, even though you can't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cook or clean…" Mahiru's observation was brutally honest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up. That's none of your business," Amane fired back, though he knew he couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    argue with the truth. He frowned and finished off the remainder of his jelly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd wised up about cleaning his place a couple days ago and was definitely planning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to do something about it sometime soon. Ruminating on Mahiru's scolding only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed to make Amane want to do it less, however. It also made him wonder why she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was making such a fuss over him in the first place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru just stared at Amane, then let out a soft sigh. "…Wait here," she instructed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before disappearing back into her own apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What now?" Amane grumbled as he listened to the clatter of the glass door closing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    behind her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd been told to wait, but he didn't know what for. Turning a puzzled gaze toward<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's apartment, Amane stood there obediently, but there was no immediate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    answer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It's starting to get chilly out here; I'd like to go inside, but…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd been told to stay put, so that was what he'd do. The autumn evening was colder<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than expected, and Amane's loosely fitting, casual clothes did little to help him stay<p></p>
    <p></p>
    warm.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane waited, watching his deep breaths come out white in the cold, he heard the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    electronic bell chime from his front door, announcing a visitor. It was pretty obvious<p></p>
    <p></p>
    who it was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Truly puzzled, Amane made his way toward the front door, dodging scattered clothes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and magazines on the floor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He knew who it was without even looking through the peephole, so he slid his feet into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a pair of slippers, took the chain off the door, and opened it. As expected, he came
    <p></p>
    face-to-face with waves of sandy-blond hair.<p></p>
    "…What are you doing?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I couldn't stand how badly you were neglecting your health. These are just some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    leftovers I had, but please take them," Mahiru stated plainly as she abruptly stuck a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hand out in front of her. In her delicate palm, somewhat smaller than Amane's own,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was a plastic container. He could vaguely see some sort of stewed dish through the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    semi-transparent lid. He couldn't tell exactly what it was, however, as the container<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had filled with steam from the warmth of the food.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed to understand the confused look in Amane's eyes as he stood there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    blinking. She let out a deep sigh. "You're not eating properly. Nutritional supplements<p></p>
    <p></p>
    are just that—supplements. You can't live on them alone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What are you, my mom?" Amane jeered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I believe what I said is common sense. Also, shouldn't you have tidied up your room<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by now? There still isn't any room to walk."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru narrowed her eyes in obvious disappointment as she looked past Amane at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the room beyond, and Amane's words stalled in his throat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I have, a little."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, you haven't. Normally, people don't drop their clothes on the floor."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Those just… fell there."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That wouldn't happen if you washed, dried, folded, and put them away properly. Also,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you should bundle up your magazines after you're done reading them. That way you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    won't slip on one and fall."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't that he couldn't sense the small barbs in her words, but he also understood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Mahiru was, for some reason, genuinely concerned for him, so he couldn't dismiss<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything she was saying. After all, the clutter of magazines had almost tripped the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    both of them up just the other night. She had a point.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had no rebuttal. He screwed up his face, squeezed his mouth shut tight, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sullenly took the container from Mahiru's hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The food suffused his palm with a welcome warmth, especially after all the time spent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    standing on his chilly veranda.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So I can eat this?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you don't need it, I can throw it out," Mahiru answered flatly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I'm grateful for it. I don't usually get to eat an angel's home cooking."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Stop calling me that, seriously."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Using her school nickname was a kind of petty, needling revenge for her critical<p></p>
    <p></p>
    comments. Her feelings about the moniker were written clearly across her pale cheeks<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as they turned red.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no doubt about it—she hated being called an angel. Were he in the same<p></p>
    <p></p>
    position, Amane was certain he would hate it, too. That hardly needed to be said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Despite understanding Mahiru's stance, Amane couldn't help but smile when he saw<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her looking up at him with flushed cheeks and tiny, bitter tears forming.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not going to say I'm sorry," he declared.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was clear that any further teasing would be certain to wreck what little goodwill she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had left for him, so Amane figured it was prudent to give it a rest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    We're not even that close.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru also seemed not to want to hear any more, and she emphasized this by clearing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her throat forcefully as she pulled herself together.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her cheeks were still tinged with red, though, so she didn't look like much had changed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, thank you for this. Though, you don't really need to worry about what happened<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't. I considered that debt settled. This is for my own self-satisfaction… I saw that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you weren't taking care of yourself, and I was concerned; that's all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course. Mahiru pitied him; that was it. There was no way to hide—she'd gotten a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    very good look at how he lived the other night. Even now, she could see the garbage<p></p>
    <p></p>
    piled up in the hallway behind him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You need to at least start eating proper meals and… get your life together!" she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    scolded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, Mom," Amane answered sarcastically. He was getting a little tired of listening to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's nagging.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane churlishly carried the meal Mahiru had brought him back into his apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He grabbed a pair of disposable chopsticks he'd gotten at the supermarket and sat<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down on his living room couch, eager to sample the flavors of her cooking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He remembered enjoying the rice porridge that she'd brought him before, even though<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his sense of taste had been dulled by sickness. The slow-cooked porridge had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    possessed a rich, comforting taste that had been gentle on his stomach. If that was any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    indication, Mahiru's cooking was undoubtedly quite good, but now it was time to find<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out for sure.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As he hastily opened the lid of the container, the savory scent of stew drifted gently up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at him. Various root vegetables had been cooked together with some chicken. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    light-colored sauce underscored the vibrant hues of carrots and green beans, all of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    which had been cut into bite-size pieces.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's stomach growled, reminding him that the only thing he'd had to eat was some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nutritional jelly. He hastily snapped his disposable chopsticks apart and brought a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    piece of daikon radish to his mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yum."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's mouth was greeted with a complex flavor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Typical of the health-conscious Mahiru, the dish was only lightly seasoned, spiced<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mostly with dashi stock. It was immediately obvious that she hadn't used storebought, 
    <p></p>
    granulated dashi. Instead, she'd made it herself using with dried bonito fish<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and kombu seaweed. The difference in taste was night and day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As he chewed it thoroughly, the flavor of the dashi and the other seasonings, as well<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as the taste of the vegetables, spread gently through his mouth. Amane had never been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a fan of veggies. He usually went out of his way to avoid them, but in this dish, the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    essence of each ingredient came together in perfect harmony, and Amane happily<p></p>
    <p></p>
    savored them all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There wasn't much chicken. Perhaps Mahiru had done that on purpose as if to tell him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to eat more vegetables. What little meat there was had been cooked plump and juicy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was nothing to complain about there, Amane thought, aside from the quantity.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For something made by a high school girl, the ingredients were a little plain, but her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    skill more than made up for it. That Amane so readily enjoyed the food was enough of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a testament to that fact.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It would have been even better with some rice, and maybe some miso soup or clear<p></p>
    <p></p>
    broth on the side, but Amane didn't have any prepared. He was all out of rice anyway,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so that modest wish was not destined to be granted that night. It was too late now, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he regretted not buying any instant rice packets beforehand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That angel's amazing," Amane said to himself as he devoured the perfectly seasoned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    vegetables, chopsticks never slowing for a second.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    To think, she's great at school, and sports, and all kinds of housework.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If Mahiru had been there to hear Amane's praise, she would have hated it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here's this back. The food was good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The following evening, Amane carried the borrowed container over to Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The boy was certainly bad at housework, but not so bad that he couldn't wash<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something before giving it back. In his hand, he held the carefully cleaned little box,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    knowing that it was good manners to return it only after it had been thoroughly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    washed and dried.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had appeared the moment Amane rang the doorbell without even checking to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    see who it was, as if she'd been expecting him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was wearing a wine-colored knit dress, and when she saw her visitor, her eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    narrowed gently. She quickly checked the container and said, "You washed it and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything, huh? Look at you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane frowned slightly when she praised him like a little child.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, thank you for taking the time," Mahiru continued. "Now take this." She pressed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a new, warm container into Amane's hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    From what he could tell, there was saute ed pork and eggplant inside. It seemed to have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooled enough that the lid hadn't fogged up, for Amane could clearly spy the color of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eggplant, grilled pork, and sprinkled sesame seeds through the clear top. From the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    color, he guessed the sauce was probably miso flavor. The sight of the eggplant with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slight scorch marks and the lustrous pork definitely roused his appetite.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No one would deny that it looked delicious, but Amane couldn't understand why he'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been handed dinner again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, um, I just came to return the container," he tried to explain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "This is today's dinner," Mahiru answered coolly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I get that, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I just want to ask: You don't have any allergies, do you? Don't get the wrong idea,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though. I won't be catering to your tastes or anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't, but… I mean, I can't accept your food again."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Taking a portion of the girl's dinner for the second time in a row seemed wrong to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane. His malnourished body was grateful for the food, and Mahiru was clearly a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much better cook than other girls her age, and the meal he was holding was sure to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    delicious, but it also held no small amount of danger.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If someone from school saw the two of them meeting like this, it could turn into a big<p></p>
    <p></p>
    debacle. That would be the end of Amane's quiet student life for sure.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    These apartments were meant for single occupancy, but the rent was pretty high<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because of the building's location and the amenities. Amane had never seen another<p></p>
    <p></p>
    student from their school in the building—except Mahiru, of course—so he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably worrying over nothing. Even with that mild consolation, his brief meetings<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with the angel still made him wary.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I made too much, so I'm just happy to be rid of it," Mahiru explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…In that case, I'm happy to take it. But someone might get the wrong idea, since<p></p>
    <p></p>
    people usually do this sort of thing for someone they like…," Amane said sheepishly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And do you have the wrong idea?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, I guess not."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    One look at Mahiru's expression was enough to clear up any misconceptions about her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feelings toward Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way that a beautiful, talented girl like Mahiru could possibly fall for an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    oblivious slob like Amane. Sure, a cute next-door neighbor bringing him food seemed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like something out of a romantic comedy, but there was no romance here—and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certainly no comedy. The situation was as devoid of those elements as Amane's own<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment was devoid of rice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What kindness existed in the angel's barbed words had been born only from pity.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well then, there's no problem, is there? And anyway, it looks like you were surviving<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on convenience-store meals and side dishes from the supermarket," stated Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How could you tell?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not hard to see that your kitchen has barely been used, and you have a ton of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    disposable chopsticks from the convenience store and the supermarket on your desk.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Besides, I can tell just by looking at you. You've got an unhealthy complexion."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's expression froze. Mahiru had gotten all that just from one visit to his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment. Everything she'd said had been spot-on; he had no room to argue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…All right, I'll be going."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru bowed and went back inside her apartment, having said what she'd wanted to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    say and given him what she'd wanted to give.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane looked at the container in his hands as he listened to the jangling sound of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chain on the other side of Mahiru's front door slide into place. The heat from the food<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was beginning to warm the palms of his hands. He let out a soft sigh and returned to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As expected, the stir-fried sesame miso eggplant and pork was delicious. Amane found<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself wishing even more than yesterday that he'd bought some rice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As time went on, Amane began swapping an empty container for a full one every day,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and his diet improved dramatically.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's cooking was always light and healthy, and since every dish made him want<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rice, Amane started fixing microwave packets with each meal. The angel had a variety<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of cuisines in her repertoire: Japanese, Chinese, even Western. Each day brought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something new, but every single meal was delicious, and Amane developed an appetite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like never before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Like a wild animal grown fat on handouts, Amane quickly came to rely on Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    charity. Even as he continued to obediently accept container after container, he knew<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it was presumptuous to expect a meal every day. Still, he happily—and hungrily—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    licked his chops each time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're looking good lately. You fix your diet or something?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki took a long, hard look at Amane one day during lunch. Apparently, his complexion<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had improved—probably because he was finally supplying his body with much-<p></p>
    <p></p>
    needed nutrition.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane knew his friend was perceptive, and he felt a bit of a cold sweat break out as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he slurped the udon noodles he'd ordered for school lunch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Itsuki, you scare me," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why's that? Do you mean I'm right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, well, I guess you could say I've had no choice but to reexamine my lifestyle recently."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whenever Amane passed by Mahiru near their apartments, she would chide him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gently to take care of himself, and she was regularly sharing her dinner with him. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was only natural that his life had improved. On the one hand, he wanted to call her his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    guardian angel, but a small part of him also felt like she was meddling where it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    none of her business.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had indirectly confirmed Itsuki's suspicions by dodging the question, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki cackled with delighted laughter. "Yeah, I knew it. You always looked unhealthy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    'cause the way you were living was so crappy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But what made you decide to 'reexamine your lifestyle'?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I guess I was forced to."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, your mom found out?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're not right, but you're not far off, either."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru really did sound like Amane's mom at times. She was much too young and too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cute to be a mother, though. Still, the way the girl went to such lengths to care for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane made it hard for him to refuse her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Say, Itsuki? Do I really seem that unhealthy?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm… Well, to start with, you're pretty pale. I guess you're tall enough, but you're<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gangly. You're also always shuffling around all apathetic-like, so you look like a zombie."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But that's just how I look…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You think I don't know that? Try looking like one of the living for a change."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't be absurd… Wait, but seriously… a zombie…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't really sure because he almost never bothered to closely check his own<p></p>
    <p></p>
    face in the mirror, but apparently, he gave others the impression that he was barely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    alive. If he looked half-dead even on a good day, that would explain why Mahiru had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been so worried about him before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You should pay a little more attention to how other people see you, Amane. You're<p></p>
    <p></p>
    always hunched over, starin' at the ground. It makes you hard to approach, and it's not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like you go out of your way to get close to anybody, either. If I didn't know any better,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'd say you're the very definition of a moody teenager."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You sure know how to keep it casual when you're insulting a guy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fine, fine, I won't sugarcoat it, then. You look like a corpse, and your life is a mess."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki continued teasing his friend, insisting that he ought to take this opportunity to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pay more attention to his appearance and demeanor, not to mention his health.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sharply turning away, Amane replied sarcastically, "Thanks for your concern."<p></p>

    4 A Chance Encounter<p></p>
    "Ah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane heard a beautiful voice ring out like a bell from behind him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recently, he'd grown accustomed to hearing that voice, but only around his apartment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    building. Now he heard it while he was standing in the sweets aisle at the neighborhood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    supermarket.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had never expected Mahiru to acknowledge him in public, so he turned around<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with some bewilderment to see her standing there, eyes wide.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A supermarket basket hung from her arm, and inside it sat a daikon radish and some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tofu, as well as a package of chicken thighs and a carton of milk. These were likely the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ingredients for her dinner tonight.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This was nothing special. Amane had coincidentally stopped by the candy aisle at the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    same time. That was all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Just so you know, this is merely a coincidence," Amane asserted. "It's not like I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stalking you or anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know, I know." Mahiru nodded. "We're both just here because it's the closest<p></p>
    <p></p>
    supermarket." Before Amane had a chance to agree, he heard the girl mutter, "Really,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though, that's the first thing that came to mind…?" She stared down at a notebook that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was carrying.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was just like the meticulous Mahiru to dutifully record everything she needed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Ignoring Amane in favor of her flower-patterned notebook, Mahiru brushed past the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sweets and began searching the condiments on display in the next aisle.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something about Mahiru searching the shelves for kitchen staples and murmuring<p></p>
    <p></p>
    things like soy sauce and mirin in her lovely voice seemed cute to Amane. It was clear<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that the girl was in a strange kind of mood, however.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mirin is right here. Look," Amane said, pointing it out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, not that—I'm looking for the low-alcohol kind. I can't buy that, since I'm underage,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "This is considered alcohol?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mirin is sweet rice wine, after all. The ones that are specifically for cooking still have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    alcohol, but they add in salt to make it gross to drink, so even underage people can buy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been about to hand her a bottle of mirin when she suddenly refused it,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shook her head, and instead placed the low-alcohol alternative in her basket.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Learn something every day…" This was all new to Amane, who did so little housework<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that even these simple tidbits seemed revelatory. He watched Mahiru as she moved<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quickly on down the aisle, stopping in front of a shelf full of soy sauce.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru frowned, as if she had only just noticed the price labels. "…Bargain price, limit<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one bottle per person…" She had apparently been intending to buy a spare. Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grumbled in disappointment and turned to glance at Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Maybe… I could buy one, too?" Amane quickly sensed what Mahiru had been trying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to convey with her eyes, and with a wry smile, he picked up a bottle of soy sauce. When<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he did, her lips formed a satisfied arch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's helpful to have someone who understands," she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're more economical than I expected," Amane commented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I don't see why I shouldn't find the best prices when I can. Cut down on needless<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expense, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wonder if that's what they call a thrifty mentality. Well, as long as you're living on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an allowance from your parents, I guess that's for the best."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane may have technically lived alone, but in reality, his parents still supported him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His family was fairly rich, and they covered the rent of his clean, safe apartment, took<p></p>
    <p></p>
    care of his school fees, and provided him with a more-than-fair allowance. Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    never had to worry about his expenses, but he was grateful for everything his parents<p></p>
    <p></p>
    did for him, so he tried not to waste money.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…That's right. We depend on their support, so it's important to be frugal," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    replied matter-of-factly, taking stock of the contents of her basket. Her voice was cold,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like something had stolen away her warmth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane flinched at Mahiru's flat tone, but when she looked up from her groceries, her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression had returned to normal. The gloomy eyes he'd seen in that brief moment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were already gone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Anyway, are you really buying that?" Mahiru asked, as if to change the subject,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looking at the packs of instant rice and the container of potato salad that were in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    basket that Amane was holding.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The meals that Mahiru was sharing with him were, of course, delicious, but they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    weren't enough on their own. To compensate, Amane would pick up a staple food and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    side salad like he'd done today.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, it's dinner," Amane explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's unhealthy," Mahiru shot back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're so fussy. I'm buying a salad, aren't I?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A potato salad… How is your body still functioning?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mind your own business."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru put wordless pressure on him, scrutinizing him with eyes that reproached him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and told him to eat more vegetables. Amane turned away and let Mahiru go ahead of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chatting about this and that, the two bought their respective things. Amane had started<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to pack his purchases into a plastic bag, but Mahiru produced a reusable bag she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brought and quickly put everything into it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was truly an environmentally conscious angel.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had only brought the one bag, however, and Amane was a little anxious that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the quantity of groceries was too much for it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With the milk, soy sauce, and low-alcohol cooking mirin, that was four liters of liquid<p></p>
    <p></p>
    altogether, and if they weighed anything like water, that meant four kilograms right<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there. There was still the whole daikon radish and the other ingredients to consider,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too. The bag had to be really heavy. Everything was packed in quite neatly, but still, it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would surely be hard work carrying it all the way back to Amane and Mahiru's building.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She's been cooking for me, so she must be going through more seasonings and ingredients<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than she normally does.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She's gotta be making a lot in order to split the dishes with me. The amount she gives me<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is always nearly a whole meal's worth. Mahiru says it's all just extra, but she must be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    making a lot of food on purpose.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After Mahiru had gone through so much trouble to take care of Amane, it'd wound his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pride if he didn't do anything to help her out now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As soon as Mahiru finished packing the reusable bag, Amane took hold of the handles<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and lifted it. It wasn't all that heavy to him, of course, but he could tell that it would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    definitely be difficult for her to carry for very long.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru may have been really good at sports, but pure arm strength was an entirely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    different matter. Surely, Amane thought, his eyes tracing her slim figure under her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clothing, surely there was no way that her slender arms could command the power<p></p>
    <p></p>
    needed to lift these heavy groceries.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    caramel-coloured eyes blinked rapidly. Mahiru looked surprised—or maybe a little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    concerned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm not stealing it or anything," Amane said in his defense.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not worried about that," Mahiru replied. "It's just… I can carry my own bags, you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It'd be more charming if you'd be quiet and let me take care of you for a change,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quipped Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's basically saying I'm not charming," Mahiru answered flatly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, think about how you act at school, then compare that to how you act toward<p></p>
    <p></p>
    me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru took a step back. Maybe Amane had unknowingly hit a nerve. The version of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself that she showed at school—the kind, gentle, modest girl everyone was familiar<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with—that was not the person Amane knew. Yes, Mahiru was always kind to him, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was also far more direct. She never sugarcoated anything or hid behind niceties.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Everything she said to him was brief and frank.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane took advantage of Mahiru's stunned silence and briskly sauntered off toward<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the supermarket exit, holding his schoolbag in one hand and the reusable shopping<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bag stuffed with groceries in the other. He was leaving her behind, but he didn't care.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unconcerned, he continued on as the gap between them grew wider. He didn't slow<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down or give her a chance to catch up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They had already been standing next to each other in the supermarket, after all. If they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    walked side by side on the way home and somebody saw them, that could start rumors.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So really, this kind of distance was best for both of them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hurried on with his heavy burden while pretending not to be aware of Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As he strode along, he thought he heard someone mutter "Thanks" behind him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    5 The Angel and the Great Cleaning Campaign<p></p>
    Amane was terrible at housework of any kind, but the thing he was worst at was cleaning.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Surprisingly, he actually could cook. More specifically, he could prepare something hot<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and usually technically edible, as long as he was willing to set aside petty concerns like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    presentation or flavor and also assumed the possibility of grievous bodily injury at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some point during the process. He wasn't completely incapable of preparing food.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Laundry was all right, too. That much was possible for anyone, even Amane. If push<p></p>
    <p></p>
    came to shove, there was always the option of taking his clothes to a coin laundromat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    All it boiled down to was a matter of stuffing everything into the machine and letting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it run with detergent and water inside. Amane could pull that off, no problem. The one<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thing he was absolutely hopeless with, however, was cleaning.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What do I do?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    One weekend, Amane had finally gotten tired of listening to both Mahiru and Itsuki<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lecture him day in and day out about cleaning his apartment and had resolved to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    finally do something about it. The only problem was that Amane was at a complete<p></p>
    <p></p>
    loss on how to get started.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He knew that this was his own fault, but the first problem was that his things were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    piled up all over the place, and he couldn't figure out how he could even begin to get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    them in order. Unsure of what else to do, Amane started by washing his bedsheets and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    airing out his futon.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What should come next? he wondered. Clothes and magazines are scattered everywhere,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so there's really no room to walk.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    One small mercy was that he always threw out any food garbage right away, so there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were no awful stenches or greasy stains. It was simply an enormous amount of clutter<p></p>
    <p></p>
    —enough that it seemed like an insurmountable problem.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane sighed softly at the mountain of work before him, the doorbell rang. He let<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out a little gasp.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Rather than a regular visitor, he had begun to think of his neighbor more like a delivery<p></p>
    <p></p>
    person, a blessing from above who just handed over gifts and then left. As he stood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before his messy room, however, Mahiru seemed like a savior.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane scrambled for his front door but couldn't find his footing. He stumbled, caught<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself, and carefully crept the rest of the way to the door with one hand pressed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    against the wall for balance.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry, I wanted to pick up my container a little earlier today… What are you doing?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru asked when Amane opened the door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I was trying to clean," he admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked at Amane, still off-balance, with a rather astonished expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I heard a loud noise just now," she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I almost fell."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I bet you did. You haven't even begun to clean, have you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wasn't sure how to start."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can tell."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane grimaced at Mahiru's comment. It was no less candid than usual, and Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really couldn't think of anything to justify his lack of progress. Besides, he knew that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    if he got sulky now and lashed out, he wouldn't be able to get her advice on how to go<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about cleaning his apartment. The trouble was that he wasn't sure how exactly to ask<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for Mahiru's help.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I was hoping for some cleaning tips, but I wonder if she'll actually give me any advice…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hesitated when he saw that Mahiru was peering past him at the clutter beyond.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her eyes conveyed her shock at the disastrous scene behind him. It truly must've been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an awful sight.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Unbelievable… I'll help you clean your apartment."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even Amane knew that it would be too shameless to ask Mahiru to help him clean.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That's why he'd only been planning to see if she had any suggestions. Never had he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dared to imagine that Mahiru would come right out and offer to help.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I hate the idea that the apartment next to mine is so filthy." Such scathing words, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    again, Amane could offer no argument. "You must think it's so easy to live alone, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you can't even clean up after yourself. Worse, you act like it's no problem, like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything will sort itself out eventually, but it clearly hasn't. Why don't you stop and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    take a moment to look at yourself?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was at a loss for words. His mother had always told him that if he was diligent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about cleaning regularly, it would be easy, but he'd ignored her, and this was the result.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was fully aware that he was suffering the consequences of his own actions.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look, as long as you keep up with routine cleaning, your place won't get this bad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    again. It's obvious that you have some terrible habits," Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're absolutely right," agreed Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He couldn't get angry with her. He already owed her so much, and she'd been so kind<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to him. Besides, everything she was saying about his past behavior was true. He had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    underestimated how difficult living alone would be, and he really did just sort of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    assume that everything would somehow work itself out, and this was the result.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could only nod solemnly at Mahiru's words.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, is it all right if I start with this room?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Is it all right with you?" Amane answered with a question of his own.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm the one who's offering, so of course it's all right. I'm going to go get ready, so while<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I do, if you have anything you don't want me to see, or any valuables, please put them<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in a closet and lock them up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not worried about that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane refused to even entertain the idea that someone who had been so kind to him,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even despite her sharp words, might steal from him. Not to mention that Mahiru was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    far too good-hearted to ever harm another person like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're not?" she inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There's no way that you would do something like that," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, that's not what I… Look, aren't you worried that I might see something that, as a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boy, you'd rather hide?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah… uh, well, unfortunately I don't happen to have any such things."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, in that case, it's fine, then. All right, I'm going to go change clothes and fetch<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some cleaning supplies. I don't take cleaning lightly, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru returned to her apartment, and Amane watched her go with a wry smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She came back wearing different clothes: a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pants. The T-shirt closely followed the lines of her body, the delicate fabric bringing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the curves and edges into full relief. Mahiru's long hair had been skillfully gathered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into a perfectly round bun, and Amane felt strangely uncomfortable being able to see<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the white nape of her neck.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Previously, he had only ever seen her in dresses and skirts, and he found there was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something refreshing about this look. Amane had thought before that boyish clothes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like this probably wouldn't suit her well, but he had clearly been wrong. He was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    beginning to realize that beautiful girls looked good in whatever they put on.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This new outfit looked comfortable for moving around the house, but it was also a look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Mahiru could've worn around town. Amane never would've imagined that these<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were clothes that she was okay with getting dirtied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't mind if those get messed up?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I was planning to throw these out soon anyway, so it's fine if they get a bit dirty."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru scanned the cataclysm that was Amane's apartment and sighed softly. "I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    only going to say this once: We're going to clean thoroughly, got it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I understand."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good, then let's get to it. I'm not going to go easy on you, and I won't let this end<p></p>
    <p></p>
    halfway through. I assume you have no objections?" Mahiru had posed the question<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so forcefully that Amane could do nothing but sheepishly reply in the affirmative.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So began the great battle to clean Amane's apartment. A battle spearheaded by an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    angel.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "First things first, let's toss any clothes into the laundry basket. Usually when you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clean, you work from top to bottom, but we have to handle the clutter on the floor first<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before we can run the vacuum cleaner. Before we start the wash, we can divide the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clothes into different loads, since there are too many to wash at once. Do you want to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    split them into things you wear and things you don't wear? Or do you want to wash<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Just do it however you like…," replied Amane. It seemed so obvious to him now. Of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    course they had to clear the floor before trying to do anything else.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…There isn't any underwear out here or anything, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Those are in my dresser, as you would expect."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's fine, then. We can probably put off washing clothes for now, since even if we<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wash and dry them, we'll kick up dust by cleaning and just end up having to do them<p></p>
    <p></p>
    again. If you're not in a hurry, you can do the laundry after we finish cleaning."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Now, regarding the magazines. Really, the only thing to do is to throw them out. I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    suppose it's a bit of a different story if you're collecting them, but from the way you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    keep them piled up everywhere, I doubt that's the case. If you do want to hold on to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some part of one, tear out the page and put it in a scrapbook, then dispose of the rest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Tie up any magazines you're getting rid of and put them out for collection."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru set about the task of cleaning right away, directing Amane to put his discarded<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clothing into the laundry basket as she gathered up every last magazine. She told him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to speak now if there were any that Amane wanted to keep, but there weren't any in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    particular that he needed, so he simply shook his head. Having received the answer<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she required, Mahiru skillfully tied up the bundle using some plastic cord that she had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apparently brought with her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "When you're finished gathering the clothes, please go through the other assorted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clutter and decide whether to throw anything out. All these different things on the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    floor: same as before, sort them into what you need to keep and what you don't. Then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    put the latter in the trash. Got it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Uh-huh," Amane answered meekly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you have a problem with taking orders, you'd better tell me now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I don't, but… I was just thinking about how quick you're doing all of this."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If I don't, we'll run out of time. It's total chaos in here, after all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though it was the weekend, time was limited. If they were going to run the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    vacuum, it would have to be during the day, considering that the noise would be a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nuisance to the neighbors. Since Mahiru knew that it would take a lot of effort to get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the place to a state where they could vacuum, she was working to tidy up as quickly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as possible.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    One part of Amane felt bad for letting her do so much. On the other hand, under<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's direction, more and more of the floor began to appear for the first time in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    long while.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Professor Shiina…," Amane muttered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you're going to ask for guidance from me like I'm a teacher, first learn by imitating.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'm not going to sort through your personal effects, so please be diligent and keep only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    what you really need," Mahiru instructed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, sir."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Please don't address me as a man."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The angel nonchalantly returned Amane's jabs as she skillfully cleared up more of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clutter with a serious expression the whole time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had a bad habit of hoarding useless junk, and he was both grateful for Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decisiveness and envious of it. Here she was, in a stranger's apartment, picking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    through the mess without hesitation. She really was the spitting image of an angel.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was so efficient that she could have easily cleaned up the whole place by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself had she wanted to. However, likely because she was in such a hurry, she got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    careless about watching her footing. There was no doubt that it was Amane's fault for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    leaving it on the floor, but Mahiru slipped on a piece of discarded clothing and lost her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    balance.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The instant a small "Ah!" escaped Mahiru's mouth, Amane dived across the room,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    aiming for the spot where he thought Mahiru would most likely fall.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A light, sweet fragrance mixed with the musty smell of the dust that had been kicked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up in the panic.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane landed on his backside, leaving his rear end to suffer a dull sting, but it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tolerable. He groaned just a bit as he felt the weight of Mahiru pressing down on him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She must be happy that I caught her right away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Fujimiya?" Mahiru looked up at him. She didn't seem angry, but she didn't seem<p></p>
    <p></p>
    particularly happy about the situation, either. Mostly, she just sounded surprised. "I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    can accept the blame for falling, but this is exactly why you must tidy up, because<p></p>
    <p></p>
    otherwise things like this are bound to happen."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm really sorry, honestly… You're not hurt, are you?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm fine. Thanks for going out of your way to catch me. I'm sorry, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, it's all my fault…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wouldn't have been able to bear it if Mahiru had gotten hurt while helping him,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    especially considering she was already sharing meals with him. That would've been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    absolutely unforgivable; he wouldn't have even been able to look her in the eye.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he needed to, he was considering kneeling and asking for forgiveness, but Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't seem too upset over her tumble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We're cleaning up so that things like this don't happen anymore, understand?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah. I'm really very sorry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine; you don't need to apologize. I'm helping you because I feel like it, after all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked just a little bit flustered as she gazed up at Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane suddenly realized how close they were and was aware of her pressing against<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him. For a boy who basically never interacted with girls on a regular basis, this was a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heart-pounding situation. Even though neither of them had any romantic feelings for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the other, something felt very wrong about it somehow.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't seem to be conscious of the situation, so Amane gently grabbed her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shoulder and pushed her off of him; then he stood up before the awkwardness could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    show on his face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Should we… keep cleaning?" he managed after a moment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, that's a good idea," Mahiru replied. Fortunately for Amane, she appeared to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    oblivious to his trembling as she grabbed the hand Amane extended and rose to her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed unaware of how closely she'd been pressed up against him, because<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she just maintained her usual expression. Amane figured that a girl like Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    must've been used to the attention of a lot of boys. Surely a little contact like that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wouldn't be enough to unnerve her like it did him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Smiling wryly at Mahiru's demeanor, Amane decided it would be wrong to leave<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything up to her and returned to cleaning with newfound resolve. Even though<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the task was wholly unfamiliar, he did his best to struggle through.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You are full of surprises."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was too focused on his work to notice the quiet words that escaped Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lips, nor did he see that her ears, hidden by her straw-colored hair, had turned slightly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    red.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Whew, now, this is clean."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In the end, it had taken the pair the entire day to clean Amane's apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Several hours were spent tidying up the clutter on his floor, and then, between<p></p>
    <p></p>
    washing the clothes, dusting the shelves and light fixtures, scrubbing the windows,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and vacuuming, the entire day had flown by before they knew it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The sun had been visible when Mahiru came over, but it had long since set by now,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    proof of just how long she and Amane had been working.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It had certainly been no small task, but those efforts were not without results. Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment was so clean that he barely recognized it. There was no unnecessary clutter,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and he could see the floor! Once-dirty windowpanes and frames didn't have a single<p></p>
    <p></p>
    speck of dirt on them. The lights, too, shone brighter now that they had been dusted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The place was finally clean. Without all the junk crowding every surface, it actually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked to be quite a comfortable space.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "To think that it took us a whole day," Mahiru observed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Guess that's what it takes when it's such a mess…," Amane answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But it was your mess."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "R-right you are."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane verbally prostrated himself before his angelic savior, who had taken mercy on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him. Mahiru, who had wasted one of her precious weekend days helping him, finished<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tying up a garbage bag with a beleaguered look. She didn't seem upset, but a hint of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fatigue showed on her face, though it was mixed with a sense of accomplishment. That<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was only natural, since she had been working all day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After everything that had transpired, Amane would have been ashamed to simply let<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru go make dinner. It'd be unforgivable to expect her to do any more work,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whether she shared a portion of her cooking with him today or not.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now that it's evening, I don't feel like going shopping, so I'm going to order a pizza or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something. Please let me treat you today. After all, you've been giving me all kinds of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    food and stuff," Amane offered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, but—," Mahiru started, but she was quickly cut off.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you don't want to eat with me, I'll order one for you, and you can take it home."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This gesture was more about showing gratitude than trying to get Mahiru to eat with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him, so if she wanted to eat alone, Amane didn't mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…That's not what I meant. It's just… I was surprised, because I've never ordered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pizza."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, you've never ordered pizza?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I live alone, but I've never ordered pizza… I've made it myself, though."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's amazing that you would even think to make it," Amane exclaimed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Normally, if someone decided they wanted pizza, the three options were to buy a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ready-made one at the store, get it delivered, or go eat it in a restaurant. He was sure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that there were very few people who would think to go through the long, laborious<p></p>
    <p></p>
    process of making one from scratch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, there's nothing strange about ordering pizza for delivery," Amane asserted. "I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    do it all the time myself: order delivery or go to a family restaurant solo… you know,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like most people."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I've actually never been to one of those, either," Mahiru admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now, that is rare. I go alone pretty often, and my parents go to restaurants whenever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they don't feel like cooking. I guess your parents aren't the type to eat out often, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…In our house, the help made the meals."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The help? Damn, you must be really rich."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Finding out that Mahiru was fabulously wealthy explained a lot. It certainly cleared up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    why Mahiru's mannerisms were so graceful and refined—and why her clothes and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    possessions were always top quality. Even the girl's gait seemed to speak of an affluent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    upbringing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At Amane's words, Mahiru broke into a thin smile. "You're right; I think I am<p></p>
    <p></p>
    comparatively well-off."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Quickly, Amane began to regret what he'd said, realizing that Mahiru's smile was not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one of delight or pride but rather a display of self-mockery. It seemed that her family<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was an area of discussion that was better left alone, and Amane didn't plan to pry any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Everybody has a thing or two they'd rather not talk about. It's only polite to respect that,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    especially with people you don't know very well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, then this will be an interesting experience, won't it? Here, order what you like."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Dropping the topic of Mahiru's parents, Amane showed her a menu for a pizza place<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane occasionally ordered from. Out of all the places that delivered, it was the best.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Their pizza was no match for one cooked in an authentic wood-fired oven, of course,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but they did offer a wide variety of toppings. Their choices ranged from the standard<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fare to stuff more suited to little kids, so Amane figured that there was sure to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something that would appeal to Mahiru's tastes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru accepted both the change of subject and the pizza menu. She immediately<p></p>
    <p></p>
    began poring over the list of options, her luminous brown eyes drawn to the many<p></p>
    <p></p>
    colorful photos of different pizzas. Her eyes weren't usually very expressive, but now<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they shimmered vividly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She must really be looking forward to this, Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed a bit nervous, but after considering it for a little while, she pointed out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a party pizza with four types of toppings and said hesitantly, "All right, this looks good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She turned an expectant gaze to Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With a slight smile, Amane nodded, picked up his phone, and dialed the number<p></p>
    <p></p>
    printed on the menu. Mahiru's eyes sparkled with anticipation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    An hour later, their pizza arrived. Mahiru dug in without hesitation. The pizza was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    divided into sections to allow the different flavors to be sampled on their own, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she'd hesitated a little over which one to try first but finally decided to start with a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    piece covered with a hearty helping of bacon and sausage.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was not surprised when Mahiru nibbled at her slice with small, delicate bites.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He supposed her refined upbringing had taught her to eat everything with poise and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grace, even delivery pizza.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Watching Mahiru gave Amane a warm feeling inside, like he was watching a small, cute<p></p>
    <p></p>
    animal. She was strangely adorable as her eyes closed and her expression relaxed a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    little while she chewed on the stretchy cheese. Usually, the girl appeared so mature; in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this moment, however, she finally looked her age.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane quelled an intense urge to pat Mahiru's head as she enjoyed the pizza with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    little, mincing bites.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing, you just look like you're enjoying it," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Please don't stare at me so much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The frown she cast at Amane was anything but cute, however.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Geez, you've really got no charm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that suits me fine. If I were to act like I always do at school, you'd say I was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    making you uncomfortable."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I guess that's true. I'm more familiar with this version of you than the school<p></p>
    <p></p>
    version."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At school, Amane barely ever even saw Mahiru, and they had certainly never spoken<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there. He only occasionally caught a glimpse of her, and she always wore that same,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    impenetrable smile that she showed to everyone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Here, he got to see beyond that layer. This has to be the real Mahiru, Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At school, she always adopted her fake, public persona.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "As far as I'm concerned," he continued, "I never get tired of this version."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The version with no charm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't hold a grudge… You know, how do I put this…? I can never tell what you're<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thinking when you're at school."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mostly about my schedule and my classes, I suppose."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So even you can be clueless once in a while, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had meant to say that Mahiru always looked like she had some secret on her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mind, but Mahiru apparently took his words at face value. She looked at him with a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    subtle protest in her eyes, as though she had meant something else entirely.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I, uh, didn't mean it like that," Amane quickly added. "It's just… You don't show what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you're thinking. All I meant was that it's easier to be around someone who's honest<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about their feelings, even if they're a little rude, than someone who you can never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    read."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Do you think how I behave at school is bad?" Mahiru asked directly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I can't really hate on it, since it's probably the secret to your success. I just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wonder if you ever get tired of it," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not really. I've been acting like that since I was little."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hard-core, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If she'd been keeping up this act since childhood, spending her whole life trying to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the perfect young woman everyone expected her to be, Amane could understand how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it would definitely be difficult for her to set that persona aside.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been able to infer a little bit about Mahiru's home life, but he knew that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there was no way he could ask her more about it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, isn't it nice to have a place where you can relax? And now you've even got a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    buddy to chill with."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Honestly, I don't find you relaxing at all. You make my stomach turn in knots," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stated coldly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm… sorry?" Amane apologized, a little dumbstruck.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru gave an exaggerated shrug and let out a strange little laugh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    6 A Visit from a Friend<p></p>
    After the day-long cleanup, Amane felt like the wall between Mahiru and him had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    become ever-so-slightly thinner, but that didn't necessarily mean they had become<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much closer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They still had absolutely zero contact at school; they would make small talk sometimes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    when he went to get his portion of dinner from her, but that was all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just the other day, Mahiru had scolded Amane, telling him that he had to keep his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment tidy. Her words were definitely stern, but they also made it clear that she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    actually did care about him, at least a bit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Amane was receiving frequent reminders and tips on cleaning, his apartment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    remained as nice as it had been when he and Mahiru had finished tidying up the place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wow, it really is clean." That was the first thing Itsuki said when he came over on a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    day off. He muttered in an astonished voice when he saw the drastic transformation<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the living room had undergone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I never thought your place could look this good. It was so dirty. I remember I helped<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you pick up stuff once before, but it was a wreck the very next day."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Give it a rest," Amane shot back at his friend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, but seriously, think about it. What's the longest number of days you've gone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    without dropping something on your floor?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "This is easily a new record. I've kept it going for two weeks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Two weeks?! That's it? That's nothing to be proud of, you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane scowled a little. He was now keenly aware that normally, people did not leave<p></p>
    <p></p>
    their things lying around on the floor. Still, he knew that Itsuki was only speaking from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a place of kindness and common sense, so Amane couldn't say much. After all, Itsuki<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had helped him out, too, long before Mahiru ever had, so Amane knew he shouldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    act like a jerk.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki smiled cheerfully at Amane's sullen silence. "Hey, I guess if your apartment's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this clean, I could even bring Chi over."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way; why should I have to watch you two flirting in my own home?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No need to be shy, buddy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't turn my place into your hangout!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Why should I have to watch my friend and his girlfriend getting all lovey-dovey?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wished Itsuki could understand his position and appreciate what kind of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    torture it was like to have to watch a sickeningly sweet couple flirting all the time. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    knew that Itsuki was just joking about bringing Chi over, but even so, Amane didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    find it very amusing that he constantly had front-row seats to their cloying relationship.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Relax, it was just a joke. Anyway, now that you've finally got the place clean, don't go<p></p>
    <p></p>
    messing it up again, you hear?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I've got it under control," Amane assured.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Someone like you… Well, whatever. Just make sure you get in the habit of putting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    things away after you take them out."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you my mom…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now, Amane, dearie, you have to be diligent about cleaning your room!" Itsuki mocked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's so creepy; you sound so much like my mom, it's scary!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt a shiver rocket down his back when Itsuki scolded him in a forced falsetto.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was sure Itsuki had never even met his mother, but still, the impression had hit a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nerve. Itsuki's impersonation of a lady wasn't particularly soothing, either. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stuck out his tongue at him, and Itsuki cackled with amusement.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is that what your mom's like, Amane? Because mine is really cold toward me…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Actually, I'm jealous. My mom bugs me whenever she gets the chance."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She sounds like a mom who really cares about her son."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I think she's just overly attached…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I'm sure she has to look after you because you're such a slob."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, shut up. I mean it, you know, that my mom is too clingy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Perhaps because Amane was an only child, his mother was always fussing over him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She didn't exactly spoil him, but she did poke her nose around in his business and read<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too much into things. Amane certainly didn't hate her, but she made him uncomfortable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at times.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother had given him all sorts of instructions when he'd left home to live on his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    own and attend high school, and sometimes she would show up to check on him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    without warning. The pop-ins could be pretty awful.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, doesn't that just show how much she treasures you, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And her love is a heavy burden."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, I give up. You're the kind of guy who never appreciates what he's got till it's gone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You talk like you've got it all figured out, but don't you have your own problems<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dealing with that kind of meddling?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ha-ha! It's Chi, man; what else can I do?" Itsuki had all sorts of issues when it came<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to his father and his girlfriend, so his lecture really didn't have much weight behind it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even so, Amane knew there was some truth to what his friend was saying, so he didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    argue any further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki sighed quietly, as if to tell Amane to let him worry about his own problems. His<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression remained cheerful and carefree, however. "I'll mess up anybody who<p></p>
    <p></p>
    interferes with me and Chi!" Itsuki said, declaring something a little unsettling.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Anyway, I'll figure out something for my dad situation, so it's all good. For the time<p></p>
    <p></p>
    being, how 'bout you sort your life out, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki laughed loudly, and Amane responded by making a sour face. "I know that; you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    don't have to tell me." He smiled secretly to himself, however, thinking how he'd heard<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that before from another person recently.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki had come to visit Amane's apartment in order to see how he was living. Well,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    actually, he'd mostly come to hang out and mess around, so their discussion about the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    state of the room quickly wrapped up, and before long, they were playing a video<p></p>
    <p></p>
    game. Their initial intention had been to study for a test the next week, but that notion<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had been quickly discarded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Careful with the health packs; we're gonna run out," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We'll think of something; it'll be fine," Itsuki answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not at this level it won't…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane pondered how best to deal with his less cautious co-op player, the sound of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the doorbell rang through the room and immediately gave rise to a different worry.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm? A visitor?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki looked up, too, after pausing the game. He knew that Amane had never really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    told anyone else where he lived, and that he didn't have any friends who might visit<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him at home, besides Itsuki himself. More importantly, any regular visitor would have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been stopped at the lobby downstairs anyway, so a page should have come through<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the intercom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't really know, but it must be a neighbor, right? Distributing a community notice<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or something," Amane fibbed, knowing quite well who it likely was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, gotcha," Itsuki answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'll just be a minute."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane did his best to dispel Itsuki's suspicions and hurried toward the front door,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    struggling to hide the twitch in his face that might give him away. He was lucky that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru hadn't called out to him after ringing the buzzer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He opened the door quickly, not bothering to check who it was, and slipped through<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the small opening to get outside where he couldn't be seen. Amane made sure to close<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the door behind himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just as he'd suspected, it was Mahiru standing there, blinking in surprise at Amane,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    who must have appeared to have been acting very unusual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Immediately, he pressed an index finger to his lips and shushed Mahiru. "…Please<p></p>
    <p></p>
    speak softly. Itsuki is here."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Itsuki?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My friend. He came over to play games."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru nodded in understanding of Amane's secretive behavior, then passed him a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    food container as she did every day without bothering to question him any further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Inside was a type of stew called oden, the perfect dish for the season now that the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    weather had gotten cold. Mahiru had probably been preparing it since morning. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    accepted it with gratitude and let out a soft sigh as he looked at Mahiru. There was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really no reason she ought to be doing this every day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look, I really appreciate what you do, but… I don't have a lot of time. Sorry," Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apologized.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wasn't waiting to be thanked or anything… I'm glad, you know, that we cleaned up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough that you can invite friends over," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I guess I should kneel down and thank you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way; don't do that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked at him with astonishment in her eyes. Perhaps she thought getting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane to do something like that would make her akin to a tyrant. Amane smiled wryly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There had been a bit of earnestness in his statement, because he truly was indebted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to her. She'd done so much for him that he really ought to be on his knees. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couldn't reconcile continuing to accept all the food for free, so he decided that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wanted to discuss paying her for the meals at some later date.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if your friend is here, I suppose you can't talk for too long. Excuse me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're always helping me out. I'll make sure to keep this secret from Itsuki."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Please do."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, even if I told him everything, he probably won't believe me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose not."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's honest confirmation raised some complex feelings for Amane, but he knew<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was right. If he was in Itsuki's shoes and someone told him that Mahiru Shiina had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been making meals for him daily, he definitely wouldn't believe them. Anyone would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dismiss such a claim as a fantasy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was how out of reach this angel was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Normally, it would be impossible to imagine Mahiru treating even a handsome,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    superior man to her home cooking, let alone a mediocre and slovenly guy like Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Hell would sooner freeze over.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Can I ask you one thing?" Amane called.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What is it?" Mahiru stopped before entering her apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What good does it do you to keep sharing your meals with me?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Typically, people didn't give away food for free—they expected something in return.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane probably wouldn't have thought about doing the same for Mahiru if their<p></p>
    <p></p>
    positions had been reversed. Even though he didn't believe for a moment that there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was even the slightest possibility that she had feelings for him, he couldn't help but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wonder.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At Amane's question, Mahiru gaze wandered upward as if she was giving it a bit of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought herself, then, without any change to her expression, answered, "My own
    <p></p>
    self-satisfaction. There's nothing more to it. It's just as easy for me to cook for two people<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as it is for one, and I guess I simply like treating people."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So it's because you like to cook?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, there's that, too. I think it's also because I can give you food without you getting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    any weird ideas, and you'll genuinely tell me that my cooking's tasty without any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ulterior motives. Plus, it's satisfying for me because I was concerned after seeing your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eating habits."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Is that how it is?" Amane pressed, just the slightest bit disappointed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's how it is. So don't worry about it. Just think of it as… a sudden bout of good<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fortune."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, ma'am."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't seem like she was going to give him any more of an answer than that,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and after bowing courteously, she said "Pardon me" and returned to her own apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I guess that's how it goes," Amane mumbled to himself. "I still don't think it's right for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her to give it to me for free, though." He opened the door back into his own place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Who was it?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My neighbor. She gave me some of her dinner. I'm gonna put it in the fridge, so don't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    restart the game without me," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, sorry, I already beat the boss."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You gotta be kidding me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    7 The Angel’s Injury and a Show of Gratitude<p></p>
    Every day on his way home, Amane passed the park where he and Mahiru had properly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    met for the first time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The building where Amane lived was less of a family-use apartment complex and more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    aimed at single people and couples, so there were few children around, and the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    surrounding apartment buildings were much the same.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Tucked away and out of sight, the little park close to Amane's building was often<p></p>
    <p></p>
    deserted. It was in that little park devoid of children, Amane saw Mahiru for the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    second time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What are you doing in a place like this?" he asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Nothing." Mahiru was sitting on a bench with straight posture and didn't budge at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all even after she recognized Amane and looked him over.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In contrast to the first time the two had met there, this time they were already<p></p>
    <p></p>
    acquainted and were on speaking terms. That had made it easier for Amane to call to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, but the girl's voice had still been stiff when she answered. It didn't seem like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was on guard, as she had been during their first encounter. This was something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    different. Amane could tell that Mahiru was being careful not to let something show<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on her face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, if it was nothing, you wouldn't be sitting here making that face. Did<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something happen?" Amane inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Not really…" Mahiru looked, as she had before when she was on the swing in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rainstorm, like she was lost and didn't know what to do. Seeing her like that worried<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane, but Mahiru didn't seem keen to speak on the matter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though he was bound by their tacit promise not to interact outside their apartments,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hadn't been able to help calling out to Mahiru when he'd seen her all alone in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the park again. Mahiru, for her part, probably did not much want to talk to him; her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression was stiff and blank.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought it was fine if the girl wasn't feeling up to talking, when he noticed that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there were a number of white hairs stuck to her blazer. "You have some hair stuck to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    your uniform; were you playing with a dog or a cat?" he asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wasn't playing. I just helped a cat that was stranded up a tree get back down," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What a total cliche … Ah, I get it now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wait right there. Don't you dare move."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had finally realized just why Mahiru was sitting there alone on the bench. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sighed and dashed off. He was certain that Mahiru would do as he had asked and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would not go anywhere. Actually, it would have been more appropriate to say that she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couldn't go anywhere.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Muttering to himself about how Mahiru chose the strangest times to act tough, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bought a compress and medical tape from the neighborhood drugstore, along with a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cup of ice normally used for iced coffee from a convenience store. When Amane at last<p></p>
    <p></p>
    returned to the park, he found Mahiru sitting on the bench, just as he'd expected. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hadn't so much as shifted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shiina, take off your tights."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He gave a direct order, and she answered in an extremely cold voice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I know it's kind of sudden… Look, I'll put my blazer over you and turn around,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so take the tights off. We need to ice the injury and put a compress on it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As expected, Mahiru was none too happy at being ordered to take off her tights, so by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    way of explanation, Amane waved the bag full of medical supplies.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's face understandably tightened. "…How did you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You had one of your loafers off, and that ankle seemed slightly swollen. Plus, you didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    try to stand up. It really is a total cliche to sprain your ankle while rescuing a cat."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, be quiet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah. Now, take off your tights and give me your foot."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was something anyone would have known just from looking, but Mahiru was making<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a sour face, perhaps because she hadn't expected him to notice that she was hurt.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Obediently, Mahiru accepted Amane's blazer and put it over her knees, so it seemed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like she was going to listen to what he was saying.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane turned his back to Mahiru, put the ice from the cup he had bought at the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    convenience store into a plastic bag, and poured water over it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After he tied the top shut so it wouldn't spill out, he wrapped it loosely in a hand towel<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he kept in his backpack, making an impromptu ice pack. Then he turned around<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slowly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had done as he had asked and removed her tights, exposing her bare legs. They<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were slender and smooth—and looked soft even as she tensed up. The unnatural<p></p>
    <p></p>
    swelling around her ankle was evident.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it's not that badly swollen, but it could get worse if you move it too much. First<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of all, this is going to be cold, but let's ice it for a bit. Once the pain goes away a little,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'll put a compress on, so take it easy," Amane explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "From now on, just ask for my help. It's not like you'll owe me or anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If anything, it's the opposite—I want to pay you back in some small way for everything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you've done for me, so I'd appreciate if you would let me solve one or two problems for you.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru sported her usual expression. Still, she didn't argue with Amane and quietly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    let him ice her ankle while her leg was propped up on the bench.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Has the pain gotten any better?" Amane asked after a moment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yeah, a bit," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, I'm putting the compress on, so… don't get mad at me for being a perv or a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    groper or something, okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wouldn't say something so rude to the person helping me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good to hear."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Stressing that he had absolutely no untoward thoughts, Amane squatted down next to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's leg and stuck a compress on her swollen, red ankle.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane initially asked about the level of pain, it sounded like the sort of thing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    where Mahiru could still stand and walk, but moving risked agitating the sprain<p></p>
    <p></p>
    further, so she was better off sitting here quietly. As long as she stayed off it, it would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably remain a minor injury.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had just finished sticking on the compress and was securing it with medical<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tape when he noticed Mahiru staring intently down at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're surprisingly skillful with that," she commented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I can do first aid. Still can't cook, though." Amane shrugged, acting a little silly,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and Mahiru let out a small laugh. He was glad to see her taut expression relax some,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even if it was only a tiny bit. Reassured by Mahiru's slightly softened attitude, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pulled the pants of his gym uniform from his backpack.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here," he said, handing them to Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't make that face at me; I don't like it. Anyway, your legs are exposed, right? And<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it's not like you can put your tights back on with the compress stuck to you. Relax, I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    haven't worn them."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It would be bad to let her put her tights back on over her swollen ankle, especially now<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that it had medical tape wrapped around it. Since it looked so painful, Amane figured<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru could wear his gym pants, both as protection from the cold and to stop anyone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from seeing her underwear.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed to understand that he was just trying to be considerate, and so she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slipped the pants on.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane snatched up his blazer and handed Mahiru the parka he'd been wearing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here, wear this," he told her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wait, but why?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do you want to be seen being carried?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Letting Mahiru walk on her ankle was a bad idea. Amane had been planning to bring<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her home from the start. They were both headed to the same place, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, sorry, but could you put my backpack on?" Amane asked. "I can't carry you on my<p></p>
    <p></p>
    back if I'm wearing it, obviously."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is there an option where you don't carry me?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look here, your ankle is twisted, so you need to rest it. No one's around, and I've got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    perfectly good legs, so please put them to use."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your legs?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What, you'd prefer my arms? Would you rather I support you from the side?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you even strong enough to carry me all that way?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you making fun of me?… Well, I'm actually not that confident."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane knew he could support Mahiru if she leaned on him, but honestly, it would be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quite difficult to fully carry her all the way back to the apartment complex. What's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more, it would be sure to attract a lot of attention, which Amane preferred to avoid.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He knew that Mahiru had been poking fun when she'd brought up his strength, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smiled, glad she was feeling well enough to crack jokes like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look, if you're game, put the hood up and wear my backpack. After you get on my back,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    take your own bag, too, while you're at it. I won't be able to hold it if I'm supporting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you," Amane instructed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Sorry," Mahiru muttered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm telling you: It's fine. It wouldn't be very manly of me to leave an injured person<p></p>
    <p></p>
    behind and go home—or to make you walk."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane crouched down and turned away from her, and Mahiru timidly leaned onto<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was wearing Amane's parka, so she had on even more clothes than normal,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but even so, he could feel her body pressed against him, slim and willowy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After confirming that Mahiru's arms were secured around his neck without choking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him, Amane stood up slowly, carrying the injured girl on his back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I knew it; she's so light, Amane thought. He wondered if he should be the one worrying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about her diet instead of the other way around. It was more likely that she was just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    naturally petite, though; that was probably all it was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru smelled slightly sweet, and though Amane could tell all sorts of things about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    how anxious she was feeling based on how tightly she clung to him, he headed for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    home without showing it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A few people did stare at the sight of a guy carrying someone on his back, but Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had completely covered her face with the hood of his parka, so Amane wasn't too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    worried about what little attention was being paid to them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, here we are." Amane carried Mahiru as far as her front door, then let her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down and quickly turned to leave without interfering any further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Mahiru could get around on her own while leaning on a wall, Amane guessed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that her injury was probably not all that serious. Thankfully, it was Friday, so Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had plenty of time to rest her ankle and get back on her feet with no problems.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't need dinner tonight, so you should rest. If you like, I could bring you some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nutritional supplements," Amane offered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm fine. I have some stuff prepared," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's good. See ya."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was the most important thing: that food wouldn't be a problem. It was essential<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Mahiru be able to keep still and rest. Amane watched her open the lock on her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    front door, and he, too, took out his apartment key.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Um," started Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane heard the girl's voice and turned around, he saw that she was looking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up at him timidly, clutching her bag to her chest. She looked somewhat troubled, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as he tilted his head in confusion, she seemed to regain her resolve and looked straight<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into his eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you for what you did today. You really saved me," Mahiru admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine, really. I just did it because I wanted to. Take care." Embarrassed by the notion<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of Mahiru fretting over his help, Amane quickly dismissed the thought from his mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After Mahiru gave him a quick nod, Amane turned to unlock his own door. It was only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    then that Amane realized that Mahiru was still wearing his parka and athletic pants,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but he was sure she would return them another day, so he slipped into his apartment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    without saying anything.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Damn, dude, you so healthy that you wear shorts year-round now?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's melancholy in Monday's gym class had less to do with his lack of athletic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    talent and more to do with the fact that he was wearing knee-length jersey shorts<p></p>
    <p></p>
    during an unpleasantly cold season. Everyone else had already switched to their<p></p>
    <p></p>
    winter gym uniforms, but Amane stood out from all the rest, his legs bare below the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    knee.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "As if. I just forgot my pants."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Idiot."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hadn't seen Mahiru over the weekend, and she still had his gym pants, but he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couldn't tell Itsuki that, so there was nothing to do but say that he forgot. He had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    resigned himself to the inevitable mockery, though when Itsuki slapped his back,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cackling with laughter, Amane still found it in himself to slap him back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane let out a soft sigh as he watched Itsuki groan quietly. Then his gaze shifted. At<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the moment, the boys were practicing their high jumps, and the girls were using the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    other side of the field. What's more, since two classes of students were using the field<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at once, it was fairly crowded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The girls were practicing different track-and-field events, so between taking turns, the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girls had plenty of time to watch Amane's class.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do your best, Kadowaki!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Usually, the boys and girls took gym class in different places on campus; with the girls<p></p>
    <p></p>
    present, the boys were getting all worked up. The girls, on the other hand, all spent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    their time watching Amane's most popular classmate, the handsome Yuuta Kadowaki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had never really talked to him before, but he was nice to everyone and was a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    great student, and on top of that, he was the ace of the track club despite being only a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    first-year. Everyone knew he was popular with the girls. Amane figured Yuuta must<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have won some kind of karmic lottery. A lot of the other boys didn't care for him as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much, and there were always a lot of sulky looks when he was around.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh wow, looks like Yuuta's as popular as always," Itsuki observed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Looks that way," Amane answered dully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't seem too interested," Itsuki prodded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it's not like we're friends or anything; we've barely ever spoken. So why should<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I care?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't as though Yuuta was mean or ever messed with Amane. They had nothing to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    do with each other, so Amane honestly did not care. He knew that he was in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    minority there, but he couldn't bring himself to envy Yuuta the same way all the other<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boys did. More specifically, Amane knew that Yuuta was so far out of his league that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    envying him was pointless.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Typical Amane. What, you don't get jealous now?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, should I be like 'Wow, I'm sooo jealous of his populaaarity,' huh?" Amane mocked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That was pretty good." Itsuki guffawed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane looked over at Yuuta, who was wearing a brilliant smile and basking in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feminine adoration. Even Amane had to admit that Yuuta's athletic body and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    handsome face made him look just like a prince. In fact, some girls had taken to calling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Yuuta rewarded the girls' passionate gazes and shrill voices with another radiant<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smile and waved back at them. He really knew how to cultivate a following.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, he sure is popular, no arguing with that," admitted Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know. The other guys can't contain their jealousy," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ha-ha. But the girls are real energetic, too." Itsuki only had eyes for his girlfriend,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose. He had no interest in other girls, so he saw the Yuuta issue as everyone else's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    problem. Chitose wasn't the least bit interested in Yuuta, so Itsuki probably didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    spend much energy thinking about him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    We've got a prince and an angel… This school has a lot of people with cringey nicknames.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Come to think of it, I wonder if Mahiru the angel ended up getting enough rest. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hadn't seen her leave her apartment over the weekend. It was good she was resting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    comfortably, but he still wondered about the state of her injury.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane stealthily scanned the field with his eyes. His class was sharing the field with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's, so she should've been there. Without too much effort, Amane spotted her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even in a crowd, the angel was easy to pick out. She hadn't changed into gym clothes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and wasn't practicing with the rest of her class. Evidently, she was sitting out today.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was sure that he was not the only boy staring at Mahiru, who sat there looking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    small and quiet. Though they were far away from each other, their eyes met suddenly,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and when Amane shifted his gaze around awkwardly, he saw a small smile pass over<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's lips. Since she was looking toward Amane, that meant she was also looking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    toward the rest of the boys. Each of Amane's classmates took the smile for their own,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nearly inciting a riot.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did she just smile at me?!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way; must be me!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "This is our chance! We've gotta impress her!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The prince is hogging the spotlight."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    To think that Mahiru could cause such excitement with just one meager smile… Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't know whether it was because she was that amazing or because the boys were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all that simple.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Buncha morons," Itsuki muttered. He'd apparently been thinking the same thing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane chuckled. "Well, if we don't wanna fail gym class, we'd better get moving, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What's that, Amane? The angel's heavenly gaze got you all riled up, too?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, nothing like that. I told you, I'm not interested."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, guess I'll drop it, then. Since you don't care and all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki seemed like he was about to start boasting about how great girlfriends are,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    likely citing his own personal experience, but Amane was quick to brush him off.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah," he said. He spared one more glance in Mahiru's direction and smiled<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wryly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you for what you did the other day. Here's your parka and sweatpants back."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That evening, when Mahiru brought him his portion of dinner, she was carrying a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    paper bag in addition to the plastic container. Amane could see at a glance that the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    parka and pants he had loaned her a few days ago were folded neatly in the bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm. How's the ankle?" he asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The pain is already mostly gone. I've decided not to do any exercise until it's completely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    healed," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's for the best. Looks like you're sitting out gym class, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had decided to play it safe and not participate in gym, and Amane figured it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was probably the right thing to do. Her ankle didn't look like it was hurting her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anymore, but she still slightly favored that leg when she walked, indicating that it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not yet entirely healed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane was nodding at the girl's sensible decision, he thought back on the day's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gym class and smiled suddenly. "You know, you're really amazing, Miss Angel. With a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    single smile, all the boys were practically bursting with excitement."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I told you to stop calling me that… And it's not as if I like that kind of attention. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really bothers me, you know," Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, who wouldn't get fired up when a beautiful person looks at them? You know,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the girls started shrieking today, too, when Kadowaki waved at them."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Kadowaki… oh, that super-popular guy?" Mahiru didn't seem to be too interested in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the prince. Actually, it seemed like she didn't even recognize his name. Amane had to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    describe him a bit before Mahiru realized who he was talking about.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Yuuta wasn't as popular as the angel, but he was a fairly well-known boy in their grade,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so Amane was surprised that she didn't know who he was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're not interested in him?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not particularly. We're in different classes, and we've never really spoken," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm. The other girls go bananas for him, though. They can't get enough of the cool<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dude."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, he does have a handsome face. But we don't talk; we don't have any connection.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So I don't really care."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're so candid about things like that," Amane observed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if looks are so important, don't you think it's strange that you don't like me?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asked Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, so you do realize how beautiful you are?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was quite right in what she said. Beauty could be the spark that ignited greater<p></p>
    <p></p>
    affections, but it was rarely the sole source of love. Amane agreed with that, just as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    agreed that Mahiru was very pretty. It was certainly a surprise to hear her say that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself, though.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know that, objectively speaking, I'm considered very attractive, and I do work hard<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to maintain my appearance. It's only natural. Given how often people make a big deal<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about my looks, I can tell what they think of me even if I don't want to know." Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't seem to be boasting in the least.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was certainly being honest about how much effort she spent on her appearance.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had always had a good-looking face, but clearly she was not content to coast<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by on natural good looks. Her hair was like a radiant halo, befitting her angelic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nickname, and the luster of her skin was also always perfect, without a single blemish.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her hands didn't get chapped, even when she was doing housework, and even her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fingernails were beautifully polished. The gentle curves of her body spoke to a
    <p></p>
    well-balanced figure that had likely taken some effort to cultivate.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm going to say something straight up, so don't get mad at me…," Amane began, "but…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you don't seem to be embarrassed by all this praise."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'd get annoyed before I'd get embarrassed if someone wouldn't stop flattering me,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru answered curtly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Guess being beautiful has its own struggles."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Still, beauty does have its advantages, so I suppose I shouldn't complain."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You say that like you wouldn't know…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What? Would you rather I bashfully say 'Oh, no, that's not true!'?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, as someone who knows what you're really like, that would be weird."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Exactly. Honestly, I don't see the point in putting on an act like that in front of you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Glad to hear it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had only recently dropped her public persona around Amane, so if she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    changed back now… Amane could feel goosebumps prickling at the thought of facing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the distant angel he saw at school rather than the girl he was gradually getting to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    know.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In the end, things between the two of them remained as they were.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane looked at the food container he'd been handed. There was actually more food<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than usual. The container was packed with several side dishes, each one a large<p></p>
    <p></p>
    portion. Rather than leftovers, it was more like Amane had been handed a fancy boxed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lunch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Today's quite the smorgasbord," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Because you took such good care of me," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I told you not to worry about that… Oh, there are croquettes in here!" Amane could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    never say no to croquettes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Croquettes were frequently sold a la carte but could be a big pain to make yourself. As<p></p>
    <p></p>
    such, you could consider them the pinnacle of home cooking. After steaming potatoes,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mashing them, stirring in saute ed beef, onions, and more, and then forming the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    patties, you had to completely chill them, then add batter and fry them. It was a very<p></p>
    <p></p>
    involved process. Even Amane, who rarely cooked anything, had watched his mother<p></p>
    <p></p>
    make croquettes and had decided never to make them himself because they were such<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a pain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I had them already made and chilling, so I only had to fry them," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is that why there's fried chicken, too?" asked Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Living alone, Amane didn't get to eat a lot of fried dishes, so he was grateful for the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    handmade food. Of course, they were best when they were freshly made, while the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    coating was still nice and crispy, served with hot rice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Sometime, I'd like to try them straight out of the oil," Amane muttered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had packed the fried chicken into the container after letting it cool, perhaps<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for hygienic reasons. So no matter what, Amane would need to warm the food back<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up. Though fried foods could be restored to a crispy texture via a toaster oven, it still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't the same as eating the stuff fresh. Amane had no doubts that Mahiru's cooking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would still be delicious, of course, but it would probably be even better right from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pan.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hadn't meant to whisper what he had been thinking; his desire had simply<p></p>
    <p></p>
    leaked from his lips. Unfortunately, he'd said it loud enough that Mahiru raised her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eyebrows a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you inviting me over?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not what I'm saying at all! It's already too presumptuous of me to share your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    meals." Amane hadn't meant it that way at all, and he shrugged and vehemently denied<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru brought a hand to her mouth and directed her gaze downward. She seemed to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be mulling something over and did not make eye contact with Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Your share," she finally said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Let me cook at your place, and we can consider that as part of paying for your share<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of the food expenses."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's sudden proposition left Amane's mouth hanging open in shock.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The accidental mention about eating the fried foods fresh had been more of a sardonic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wish than anything else. That Mahiru had actually considered and agreed to it left<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane completely bewildered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Normally, who would think of going into the home of some boy they didn't know all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that well to cook dinner? Maybe it would be more efficient to cook at his place rather<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than bring the food over after, but he was a member of the opposite sex, and it wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like they were close friends. Wouldn't doing that make Mahiru uneasy?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You definitely don't need to do that; I've already received way more than I could ask<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for, way more than I deserve… Aren't you worried about your safety?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you try anything, I'll crush you. Hard. No mercy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ack, you're scary! I felt a chill."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I don't suppose it will come to that. You already know what the risks are, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I've decided you won't do anything. You know how popular I am at school, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Even supposing I did try something, it'd be the end of me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was vastly more popular than Amane, and on top of that, everyone saw her as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this delicate girl, so if word got around that Amane had so much as thought about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doing anything inappropriate to her, he was sure he'd never be able to set foot on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school grounds again. Amane was not so foolish or so unprincipled as to try something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    knowing that it would mean, at best, social ruin. He wasn't interested anyway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Besides…," Mahiru added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Besides?" Amane asked, urging her to continue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're not even the right type for someone like me," Mahiru asserted with a straight<p></p>
    <p></p>
    face, then suddenly smiled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And what if I was your type?" Amane pressed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "First of all, I believe you were the one who insisted on talking to me. And then wanted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nothing to do with me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And that won you over?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, it told me that you're harmless enough," Mahiru explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, thanks, I guess."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whether that was a good thing or not, Amane couldn't deny it was true. After all, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had never had any intention of doing anything with Mahiru in the first place. One thing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was certain, however: Amane was not going to pass up the chance to enjoy a freshly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    made meal. He accepted the title of harmless guy and gained the privilege of sharing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dinner.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    8 The First Meal Together<p></p>
    Mahiru was going to start cooking dinner at Amane's apartment, and she presented<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him with a list of conditions:<p></p>
    <p></p>
    • Amane would pay for half the cost of ingredients, plus an additional labor cost, plus<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the cost of any incidental expenses.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    • The two of them would each contact the other no later than the day before if they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had something to do and couldn't eat together.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    • They would divide the work of shopping and cleaning up afterward.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Regarding the extra labor cost, it had taken some work to get Mahiru to agree to it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had insisted that he felt bad about all the time she was spending on him. It was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to be expected, since she did all the work making the food. Aside from that, though,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane and Mahiru had come to an agreement rather quickly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    And so, the day after their agreement had been ratified, Mahiru came over early holding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    supermarket bags in both hands and made preparations to start cooking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's really all brand-new, like it's hardly been used…," Mahiru commented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up," Amane shot back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A beautiful girl stood in his kitchen, and she was wearing an apron. This was like a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fantasy come to life. Amane was sure he was going to lose it any second now. When<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru pointed out, yet again, that he had really never used his kitchen, he felt a deep<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shame.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You've got an impressive collection of gadgets here, but they're like pearls tossed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before swine," Mahiru observed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if you use them, they won't go to waste," Amane reasoned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's a poor excuse, after the fact. Your precious cookware is practically dying from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    neglect."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right then, bring it back to life with your amazing culinary talents. I sure as hell<p></p>
    <p></p>
    can't."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With gracious concession, Amane motioned for Mahiru to take over. She returned the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gesture with an exasperated expression, but perhaps because she'd expected as much,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she just sighed and didn't complain further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, let's get started. Do you have any spices?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course I do; are you making fun of me? They're all properly stored—and none are<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expired, either."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wow, I'm surprised."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's because they've never been opened."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's nothing to brag about. All right, if you don't have what we need, I can bring<p></p>
    <p></p>
    things over from my place to use this once."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That would be helpful."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For now, if you have the basics, I think we can make do. Also, I decided on today's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dishes already; is that all right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't know much about cooking, so I'm happy with anything as long as I get to eat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I don't have strong preferences."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Really? Then let's hurry up and get started… Please show me where you keep<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "In this basket."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "They're really unopened, huh…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru raised her eyebrows in shock as she stared at the basket filled with untouched<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seasonings. Perhaps because she'd been warned before she'd seen the unused spices,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she quickly reassumed her usual demeanor and began washing her hands at the sink.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, I'm going to start making stuff, so you can go wait in the living room or in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    your bedroom," Mahiru declared.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay. I can't help you with anything anyway," Amane accepted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What a gentleman. I suppose you'd just get in the way if you hung around."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're awfully honest."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's just the truth. There's no need to sugarcoat it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Mahiru said, he would clearly just be in the way, so Amane obediently returned to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the living room and watched her back as she worked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When she had finished washing her hands, Mahiru quickly set to work. Amane didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    know what she was making, but based on the ingredients she had readied, it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably Japanese food.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Everything about this felt strange to Amane, like he was in a dream, but it was real.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was actually preparing the ingredients right there, her hair tied up in a gently<p></p>
    <p></p>
    swaying ponytail.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What's with this situation? It's like I've got a wife or something, Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru probably didn't feel the same way, but their setup looked a little too much like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they were a happy family, and Amane couldn't help but imagine it. He didn't have even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the smallest desire to live with Mahiru, but the sight of a beautiful girl standing in his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kitchen was in itself enough to send his mind to all sorts of places. Whether or not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there was any affection between Amane and Mahiru, just having a lovely girl treat him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to a home-cooked meal was enough to touch Amane's heart.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Are you thinking weird things over there?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can stop with the strange speculations."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had frozen when Mahiru called him out. She'd guessed what he was thinking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    without even turning around.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She sure is sharp…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Feeling amazed and anxious all at once, Amane stamped down on the not-quite-evil<p></p>
    <p></p>
    base instincts that had begun welling up inside him and returned to staring at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    About an hour later, Mahiru began setting out completed dishes on the table.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She'd chosen to make Japanese food today, which was typical when one considered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her penchant for healthy cooking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It turns out you have quite a few utensils and seasonings, so it looks like I won't have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to bring anything from my place. Starting tomorrow, I can try more elaborate dishes,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, I'm just grateful you're making anything for me," Amane admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Perhaps because Mahiru hadn't known how many pieces of cookware and seasonings<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had in his collection, she had made many simple dishes rather than anything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more intricate, but the presentation was flawless nonetheless.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Lined up along the table was an array of Japanese-style dishes. From fish simmered in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    soy sauce to dressed greens. From rolled omelets to miso soup. Every last item was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something Amane could never dream of making himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Previously, Amane had said he didn't have any particular likes or dislikes, but he did<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in fact love Japanese food. He wanted to reassure Mahiru, who looked apologetic for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    having only prepared easy recipes, that this was exactly what he had wanted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It looks amazing," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm happy to hear you say that. Eat up while it's still hot."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru sat down in a chair next to her, so Amane took a seat across the table.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His dining table was small, since he lived alone, so no matter how they sat, they were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    still close together. It was lucky that Amane happened to have two chairs just in case<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a guest stopped by, but seeing a beautiful girl sitting right before his eyes evoked some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    indescribable feeling from within him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once Amane set upon the food, however, even Mahiru's beauty ceased to matter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Hurriedly, he said "Let's eat" and started with the miso soup.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The moment he brought the bowl to his lips and took a sip, the fragrant miso and the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    flavor of the dashi spread through his mouth. The gentle taste was so completely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    different from instant miso soup. Amane could tell that it must have been prepared<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with great care. The miso flavor wasn't overpowering, and it was thoughtfully<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seasoned to allow the taste of the dashi broth to come through.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At first, Amane felt that the soup's taste was just a little bit strong, but after he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    considered drinking it while eating the other dishes, he realized that it struck the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    perfect balance and knew he would empty his bowl. Rather than being overwhelming,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the miso soup was a comforting flavor. It was a taste that made you want to eat more.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Delicious," Amane said with sincerity.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you for saying so." Mahiru's eyes crinkled in a relieved smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been complimenting Mahiru's cooking for a while, but she'd probably been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feeling nervous with this being the first time she'd cooked right in front of him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru watched Amane for a few moments before eating anything herself. Once she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    finally did start digging in, Amane extended his chopsticks toward the other dishes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sampling a bit of each dish, it came as no surprise to Amane that everything Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had prepared was fantastic.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The simmered fish was bursting with juicy flavor without sacrificing its tenderness.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Usually when fish was cooked for a long time to bring out the taste, it would naturally<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lose some moisture and dry out, but this one was plump and had a nice texture.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As for the rolled omelets, they were tailored exactly to Amane's tastes. They were an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enticingly vivid yellow, and when Amane stuffed one in his mouth, he was unsurprised<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by the gentle seasoning of dashi that greeted him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When it came to Japanese-style omelets, Amane knew, some people added sugar when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    making them, while others only used salt. These rolled ones had been flavored with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dashi, however. In addition to the rich taste of the dashi, Amane could also taste a faint<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sweetness. He wondered if that light undertone came from honey. There probably<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't that much in the rolled omelets, but the satisfying hint of sweetness brought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out a real depth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had no real preference between sweet or salty when it came to egg dishes, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the ones he liked best combined the complex flavor of dashi with what he suspected<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was a bit of honey. Mahiru had accomplished that expertly, and Amane found himself<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quite impressed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Quietly muttering that the rolled omelets were delicious, Amane grabbed another one<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with his chopsticks and quickly tossed it in his mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Not only had they been perfectly flavored, they'd been skillfully cooked as well. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stock added to the eggs made them extra juicy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    These are definitely better than Mom's rolled omelets. He kept rude thoughts about his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nonpresent mother to himself as he smacked his lips happily. Then he realized that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was staring at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You really seem to be enjoying it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Because it's all so good. I'm paying my respects to the delicious food."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure, all right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Besides, doesn't it feel better when I'm honest about how much I enjoy it rather than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sitting here eating with a blank expression?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If you think something's delicious, you've got to really act like it, otherwise, the person<p></p>
    <p></p>
    who made it will be left wondering. Even if you say you enjoy it, who would believe you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    if you didn't look the part? It's better to be honest and just let how you feel show directly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on your face. Whether you're the one giving thanks or being thanked, it's best to do what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feels good.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yes, I suppose so…" Mahiru seemed to understand what Amane was saying, and she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smiled slightly. It was a gentle expression, and it betrayed just a hint of relief. It was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sweet enough that all of Amane's thoughts ground to a halt for a second.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Fujimiya?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah… no, it's nothing," Amane replied. He'd been enchanted by the angel's smile, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he couldn't possibly tell her that. To conceal his growing embarrassment, Amane took<p></p>
    <p></p>
    another bite of food, ending any further discussion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you for dinner."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm glad you liked it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had completely devoured every dish Mahiru had laid out. Mahiru's words had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been calm, but her expression was serene, and she seemed happy that Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    packed everything into his stomach. Not a single grain of rice had been left behind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It was delicious," Amane complimented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I could tell that much just by watching you," Mahiru quipped dryly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Better than my mom's cooking."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I hear it's taboo to compare a girl's cooking to your mother's."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Isn't that only true when you're criticizing someone? Anyway, does that bother you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't mind, no."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well then, it's fine, right? It doesn't change the fact that it's delicious."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was clearly no amateur cook. Amane's mother probably had more years of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    experience under her belt, but she preferred different tastes, and many of her dishes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were fairly bland, so they were no match for Mahiru's carefully concocted foods.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Man, this is so awesome. To be able to eat like that every night!" exclaimed Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "As long as I don't have anything else going on, that is," Mahiru added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…So I can really host you every night for dinner?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wouldn't have suggested it if I was against the idea."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I guess that's true."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was a straight shooter, so of course she would've never agreed to it if she didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want to in the first place. Amane still wasn't sure if it was okay to have her cooking for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him like this so often, however.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was paying for half the ingredients, plus a bit extra to cover her labor, but even so,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he couldn't help feeling like the burden on Mahiru was too large.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Do you normally cook for boys you don't even like?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm doing it because you were neglecting your health. Besides, I enjoy the act of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooking itself, and I don't hate seeing you eat it with such gusto."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But…," Amane started.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If it bothers you that much, it would be no problem to stop."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, please, I'm begging you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At the first sign of Mahiru possibly not cooking for him anymore, Amane instantly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    retracted any and all complaints. That was just how much her food meant to him. To<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have it snatched away now—it would practically be a matter of life and death.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was entirely aware that Mahiru had gained full control of him by way of his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stomach, but Mahiru's cooking was just too delicious to refuse. Returning to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    convenience-store meals now would be like robbing the world of color.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shocked at Amane's immediate reply, Mahiru was stunned for a moment before<p></p>
    <p></p>
    breaking into a smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well then, please continue to enjoy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It appeared that Amane's days of dining with the extremely charitable angel who made<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all the food by hand would continue for a while yet. Amane couldn't help but sigh from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    happiness, guilt, and anticipation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    9 The Angel’s Birthday<p></p>
    "Amaneee, how'd you do?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Semester exams had finally ended. Having survived their collective hell, the students<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gathered in their classroom, more exited and animated than usual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane and Itsuki, both relieved that they had wrapped up all their tests, were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    comparing their performances.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm? Oh, pretty average," Amane answered. "Not that great, not that bad."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The exam had covered the expected material, so for anyone who studied daily, it wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that difficult. Amane had done about as well this time as he had with other tests,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    leaving little to say about his academics one way or the other.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane got bored easily, but he nevertheless always made sure to study. He was able<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to retain most of the things taught in class, but it was far too difficult to get a perfect<p></p>
    <p></p>
    score, so his scores usually floated between a solid eighty and ninety.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I bet you'll make it into the top thirty, if you didn't outdo yourself… you egghead,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki teased.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's because I study every day," Amane shot back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, how nice for you!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't start; you're the one forgetting to study 'cause you're too busy flirting."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The difference between Amane and Itsuki probably had less to do with their intellectual<p></p>
    <p></p>
    capacities and more to do with which one of them spent all their free time with a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certain girlfriend named Chitose. Itsuki had the ability to make it into a pretty high<p></p>
    <p></p>
    score bracket if he ever bothered to study seriously, but since Chitose was his real<p></p>
    <p></p>
    priority, his actual rank was much lower than Amane's.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Girlfriends are great, you know?" Itsuki said wistfully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, Amane, you should get a girlfriend, too!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If guys could just get girlfriends whenever they wanted, the men of the world<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wouldn't shed so many bitter tears."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There were plenty of unsatisfied men who would have taken offense at Itsuki's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thoughtless remark. Amane, though, wasn't really inclined to get angry with him over<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it. In fact, he'd never really felt that way about any girl, so he was content to let the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    comment pass.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Assuming I did get one, what then?" Amane inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A double date," Itsuki replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That would end in a bad case of heartburn for my fictional girlfriend and me. We'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have to break up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You could flirt in front of us, too, y'know!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do you really think I can find a girlfriend, the way I live?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I guess it's impossible."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was honest to a fault, even with himself. He'd always found other people difficult<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and exhausting, and he was aware that many people found him to be standoffish. That,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    plus the blunt way he spoke, meant he was not all that popular. Amane's social status<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would've made it hard to find a girlfriend, even if he was looking for one.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Against all odds, if Amane did somehow find a girlfriend, he was sure they wouldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be like Itsuki and Chitose. He couldn't picture himself flirting in public with a girl,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    oblivious to anyone who might see.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, you should at least find someone you like, Amane. If you just cut your bangs<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a little shorter, cleaned yourself up, and maybe found a style that worked for you, the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girls would definitely look at you differently, I'm tellin' ya."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Assuming Amane's self-evaluation was accurate, he didn't have the handsome looks<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of a pretty boy like Yuuta or a Romeo like Itsuki, but he definitely didn't think he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ugly, either. Amane figured that if he just spent more time on his grooming and paid<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more attention to his clothes, he could rival most of the other boys his age. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    problem was that he didn't know enough about fashion to dress well, and he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certainly not smooth enough with his words to win any girl over.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not interested in the kind of girl who picks a date based on appearance," Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asserted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You say that, but if you don't get them interested in the first place, you won't even get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to know them well enough to judge their personality, right?" Itsuki argued back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Even if that's true, I'm not really looking for a girlfriend right now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Were some hypothetical girl ever actually interested in Amane, it would be all over the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    second she saw how he lived. Amane was a slob with no life skills, and on top of that,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had a difficult time getting along with other people. If there was a girl who was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    drawn to him, despite all that, he'd like to meet her. Such a hopeless thought was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough to bring a bitter smile to Amane's face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Besides, since Mahiru was cooking dinners for him now, a girlfriend could introduce<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some unpleasant complications. Not that Amane intended to pursue a relationship in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the first place, but that was simply one more strike against the idea.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt that Mahiru's delicious cooking was worth more than the possibility of an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as-yet-unseen girlfriend, and that conviction was not likely to be easily overturned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ugh, you're so boring… How about I get Chi to introduce you to one of her friends?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    offered Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You care way too much about this. Most of Chi's friends are too… excitable. It's hard<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for me to hang out with them, even as friends." Amane quickly shot down the idea.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Only because you're so gloomy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if you say so, I won't say anything to her for now. But as a blossoming high school<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boy, isn't it sad to live an empty life, all by yourself?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't need a girlfriend; they're too much trouble."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just what do you think we're supposed to be doing at school anyway? Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even if he wasn't actually that serious about his studies, he still didn't see the point in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    spending so much time worrying about romance. Above all, finding a real match was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    no easy feat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What a waste," Itsuki grumbled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah." Amane shrugged.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But listen, you'll change your tune when you find a good one, Amane, ya hear?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What makes you so sure?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Because girls particularly like to fuss over guys like you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whatever you say, man."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't imagine acting so sentimental; it didn't seem possible. He decided to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    simply ignore his friend's words. Itsuki was looking at Amane with an exasperated<p></p>
    <p></p>
    glare, when suddenly, his line of sight shifted, and his face relaxed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Itsukiii! Let's go home together!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, Chi!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just then, Chitose appeared. Apparently, Itsuki had promised to walk her home, which<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brought a swift end to their conversation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane turned to see where his friend's attention had shifted, he saw a girl with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    medium-short light-brown hair tinged with red, looking their way with a radiant<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smile. Well, to be more accurate, she was only looking and waving at Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The girl's lively aura and bright, smiling face were enough to make Itsuki beam<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whenever he saw her. That was the kind of effect Chitose had on people, and for better<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or worse, she was always the center of attention.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose was a different type of beauty than Mahiru. She had a great big smile as she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rushed over. With any luck, she wouldn't have much to say today, because usually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whenever Chitose talked, she made fun of Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You agree, right, Chi? Amane's the type of guy who needs a girlfriend to take care of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him, don't you think?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong," chided Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wait, what, do you have a girlfriend, Amane?!" Chitose exclaimed excitedly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Aw, bummer," Chitose said, pouting. "If you did, I'd want to be friends with her."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Knowing your idea of friendship, I would feel bad for my imaginary girlfriend,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, so you have an imaginary girlfriend?" Chitose asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Weren't we just talking about what if I had one?!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Kidding, kidding."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I get tired just talking to you…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's just because you don't have the stamina to handle me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't have the patience, more like…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even a short exchange with Chitose was mentally exhausting for Amane. Most of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    time, he tried to keep his head down and avoid other people, like at school. When he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    found himself forced to carry on a conversation with someone as extroverted as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose, it was really demanding.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose didn't let Amane's sour attitude bother her at all and flashed the
    <p></p>
    exhausted-looking boy a truly joyful-looking smile. "You're such a mess."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki smiled in the same way and tossed out some perfunctory advice. "You'd better<p></p>
    <p></p>
    get your act together, buddy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was already too worn-out, managing only to let out a deep sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What are you doing?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After returning home and gobbling up Mahiru's handmade food, Amane returned to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the living room once he was finished doing the dishes and saw Mahiru with a question<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sheet spread out before her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There'd been no agreement about cleaning the dishes, but Amane took the initiative<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to shoulder the burden whenever possible. While he'd been tidying up, Mahiru had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gone to sit in the living room. It would have been inexcusable to make her do<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything and then hurry on home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm grading," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, I can see that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She seemed to be reviewing her answers with her textbook out, checking that she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hadn't gotten anything wrong.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So what's the result?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if I didn't make any recording errors on my answer sheet, then it's… a perfect<p></p>
    <p></p>
    score."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can't think of anything to say except 'It figures.'"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just as Mahiru didn't show much of a reaction in regard to her errorless work, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't have a very exaggerated response. He wasn't surprised, because her name was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    practically always written in the top spot of the periodic exam results. He knew Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was more than capable of a perfect score, so he was not the least bit surprised by her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    performance here.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's because studying doesn't bother me. I've actually already completed all of this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    year's coursework, so now it's enough to simply review," Mahiru explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whoa, you really go all out…," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You study a lot yourself, Fujimiya."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You know what my grades are like?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I sort of remember your name in the ranking list."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, Mahiru had known a little bit about Amane before they ever spoke. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    must have noticed him among the top ranks, because she recounted his exact placement<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the most recent test without hesitation, almost like she was looking at the list right<p></p>
    <p></p>
    now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane did work pretty hard at his studies, but it wasn't because of some earnest drive<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for success or anything. It was because of an agreement he'd come to with his parents.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In order to live alone, he had to maintain good grades.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it's a condition for my current lifestyle: I have to keep my grades up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The only other facet to the agreement was that Amane had to visit home at least once<p></p>
    <p></p>
    every six months, but he could take care of that over long school breaks. Basically, as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    long as he was keeping his grades up, there were no problems.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I study hard enough to keep my head above water, but nothing like you. You really put<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a lot of effort in."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I have to try hard," Mahiru mumbled, casting her eyes downward. Her expression<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was hidden by her bangs, and while Amane couldn't get a proper look at it, anyone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would have recognized it wasn't a happy one. Before he could get a read on her, though,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she quickly looked back up, once again wearing her usual expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even if there had been time to point out the curious change, Amane probably wouldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have. He could tell that Mahiru was carrying some kind of painful burden by certain<p></p>
    <p></p>
    things she did or faces she made.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While Amane made sure to never ask Mahiru what was bothering her or what was so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unpleasant, he still got the impression that she was struggling with something. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    imagined that, whatever it was, it had its origins in her home life. It was hardly the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kind of subject he could just casually broach with the girl. He understood that this was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not an area in which an outsider like himself could intrude, and so Amane never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    touched the subject, and he persistently tried to maintain a sense of distance<p></p>
    <p></p>
    appropriate for a neighbor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Everyone had things they didn't want to talk about, even Amane. Treading thoughtlessly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on Mahiru would be rude, and he was sure that she appreciated the fact that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pretended not to notice her distress.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Having disguised her abrupt change in mood, Mahiru declared in a clear voice that she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would be heading back to her own apartment. She put her textbook and her answer<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sheet back into her bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't have any intention of stopping her, so he replied simply "Mm-hmm,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sounds good" and watched Mahiru get ready to leave.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When the angel had finished putting everything away, she stood up from her seat, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane noticed that she'd left something behind next to her empty cup. He picked it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up and discovered it was a case holding Mahiru's student ID, the kind any student<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would have. She'd probably pulled it out along with her textbook and forgotten to put<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Along with her name and picture, the little plastic card displayed common<p></p>
    <p></p>
    information, like her student number, birthday, and blood type. After staring at it for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a second, Amane called out to Mahiru, who was in the entryway and putting her shoes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You forgot this," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, sorry for the trouble. Well then, good night."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Night."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru gave a quick, polite bow and turned her back on Amane's apartment. With a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    small sigh, Amane watched her leave.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thinking back to the birth date listed on Mahiru's school ID, Amane put a hand to his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forehead as he realized something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…That's in four days, isn't it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he hadn't unintentionally seen the girl's ID, he likely never would've found out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wished that he'd known about Mahiru's birthday a little earlier and let out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    another sigh, a deep one.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, I was wondering, is there anything you want?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The following day, Amane tried to see if there was anything Mahiru might like as a gift.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no ulterior motive behind the gesture. In fact, Amane had been thinking for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a while that it might be nice to get something for the girl who had been taking care of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him every day. A birthday seemed like the perfect time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There must have been something odd about the way Amane phrased the question,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    however, because Mahiru gave him a puzzled look. One that made Amane begin to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    regret asking such a direct question.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why are you asking all of the sudden?" Mahiru inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't seem very materialistic, so I was just curious."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Out of nowhere again…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought that he should probably have tried to play it a little smoother, but it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was too late for that now. The one possible saving grace was that Mahiru didn't seem<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to have realized that this was about her birthday. As far as she knew, Amane should've<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had no way of knowing her date of birth. Hopefully, that would keep her from catching<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, let's see, there is one thing I need. I guess that's what I want right now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What do you want?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A whetstone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A… whetstone?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unconsciously, Amane repeated Mahiru's words, because the girl's answer had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    far too unexpected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No one could've expected that kind of answer from a high school girl. Normally, you'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    think they would want cosmetics, or accessories, or bags, or something like that, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought. He would never in his wildest dreams have expected a girl to want a tool for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sharpening metal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's right, a whetstone. I already have several, but I want one with a finer finishing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    surface, you see," Mahiru explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you sure you're really an ordinary high school girl?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Please don't expect me to be ordinary."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was difficult for Amane to object to that. Mahiru could not be called an ordinary high<p></p>
    <p></p>
    schooler, by any standard. Describing her as an angel seemed entirely accurate.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was a prodigy who was good at school and sports. What's more, she was an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    excellent cook and a skilled housekeeper. As if that wasn't enough, Mahiru was a noble<p></p>
    <p></p>
    young lady who spent so much time taking care of a slob like Amane that she could've<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been mistaken for a married woman.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Still, who could have imagined she'd want something like a whetstone?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had to be the only high school girl in the whole world who wanted such a thing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can't buy it yourself?" Amane wondered aloud. She was well-off, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not exactly that I can't buy it, you know. It's just—I won't have that many<p></p>
    <p></p>
    opportunities to use it, and it's pretty expensive. After considering all that, I couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really justify the purchase. I already have one that can put a decent edge on, so I keep<p></p>
    <p></p>
    telling myself that I don't really need it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had to admit that it was more than a bit frightening to know that Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    owned several whetstones already.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…How many high school girls out there sharpen their own kitchen knives?" he asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Quite a few," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Even if there are, you're the only one I know, and you're also the only one who wants<p></p>
    <p></p>
    another whetstone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I suppose it's nice to be unique."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you say so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This certainly was an angel with unusual interests. Amane couldn't make heads or tails<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru tilted her head in confusion as Amane stood there looking baffled. He'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    completely lost sight of his original objective.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, Itsuki?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After completely failing to decide on a gift that Mahiru might appreciate, Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decided instead to consult with his best friend. Itsuki had a way with women's hearts,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as well as a girlfriend to consult, so Amane expected that he would probably have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some grasp on what a girl would normally want. While he wasn't really sure it was a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    good idea to try to apply normal standards to someone like Mahiru, he expected that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she wouldn't outright hate things that made someone else's girlfriend happy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What's up?" Itsuki replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "When you give Chitose presents, what do you usually get her?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought it would be best to start by asking what Itsuki bought for his girl, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all he got back was a blank stare.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, you planning on giving a present to some sweetheart of yours?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do you think I have it in me to do something like that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nope."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, then."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "In that case, why are you asking?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Someone I know has a birthday coming up, so I wanted to ask you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While Amane was planning on listening to Itsuki's advice with the utmost attention,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was also keen not to reveal too much about his own circumstances.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm… for starters, you should try finding out what they want. You know, it's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    important to do that sort of research on a regular basis. It's the secret to a harmonious<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relationship, I'm telling you," said Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I told you that this isn't for a girlfriend," Amane reminded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Setting aside the potential grave danger the other boys at school would pose to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's physical safety if word ever got around, Mahiru was too awe-inspiring to even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    consider asking out in the first place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sure, he was comfortable hanging around with her, and they got along well enough as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    two frank individuals, but there were absolutely no romantic feelings between them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sure, she was cute, but that didn't mean Amane wanted a relationship.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What they want, huh…? And what if you don't know?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Depends on how close you are. If you're good friends, an accessory or something is<p></p>
    <p></p>
    good, but if you're not close, something practical that they can use is a safer bet. There<p></p>
    <p></p>
    are lots of girls who're happy to get flowers but don't know what to do when they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    receive them," Itsuki explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You sure know your stuff."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I've done a fair bit of research, I guess."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki and Chitose hadn't always been so wild about each other. Their relationship had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slowly developed, first starting in middle school. Amane had gone to a different middle<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school, so he didn't really know all the details, but apparently, they'd gone through a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lot together, and their relationship had grown from those experiences to the point<p></p>
    <p></p>
    where these days, they wouldn't shut up about each other.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    To hear him tell it, Itsuki had also been fairly lost the first time he'd had to give Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a present, so Amane figured he could benefit from his friend's experience.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, and no girl hates hand cream," Itsuki added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hand cream?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane was pondering this unexpected option, Itsuki grinned and explained<p></p>
    <p></p>
    proudly, "No matter what age they are, every girl has some use for it. If she's a student,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her hands get dry from handling notebooks and textbooks in class; if she's in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    workforce, her hands dry out from typing and air conditioning; and housewives cook<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and clean, so their hands take a beating, too. You can't go wrong with that stuff."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm. You sure know an awful lot about women's hands…," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're the one who came and asked me!" Itsuki snapped.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki slapped Amane on the back, but there was no power behind it. The two friends<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shared a laugh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Hand cream, huh? I guess that is a pretty safe bet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been taking the initiative on washing the dishes after dinner, but Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    obviously did her own dishes at home, so he could imagine her hands could use some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    moisturizing. More importantly, Amane was sure she took care of her hands already,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    since they were so smooth. A gift she could use right away really was the best plan.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Cool, thanks for your thoughts," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Let's try asking Chi, too. As a fellow girl, she probably has a better idea," proposed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Eh…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You gotta warm up to her."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane certainly didn't hate her, but Chitose was not exactly his favorite type of girl,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and being around her always made him feel awkward. Usually, he tried to avoid<p></p>
    <p></p>
    interacting with her altogether. Itsuki slapped Amane's back again gently, smiling in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    amusement.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whaaa—? Amane, you're giving a girl a birthday present?" Chitose was smiling—no,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smirking—at this rare development, and it was all Amane could do not to grimace.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had gone to Chitose's classroom to talk to her after school, and sure enough, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed greatly amused. Incidentally, Itsuki had sent Chitose a message saying that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't worried about her being alone with another boy as long as it was Amane, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had gone on home. Amane had sighed softly, while Chitose had worn a wide grin.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I told him I didn't want to ask her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was obvious that she was definitely going to pry and ridicule him, so he hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    intended to turn to her for help at all. Amane certainly didn't hate Chitose, but he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couldn't deny that there were some things about her that he just couldn't stand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay, so Itsuki wrote here that 'Amane was hoping you'd give him some pointers.' So<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you want my help, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're the only girl I can ask, Chi."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It doesn't sound very nice when you put it like that, you know." Chitose looked at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane with clear pity, but he let it pass.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The truth was, Amane had no female friends outside of Chitose. Every single girl in his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    class barely counted as acquaintances, and he wasn't close enough to any of them to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be able to ask for help with things like this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Actually, Amane was usually rather quiet in school. If one of his female classmates<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tried to talk to him, he probably wouldn't know what to do.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, well, I can't imagine you really understand how girls think, Amane. But don't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    worry! Miss Chitose is here to advise you!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I guess I'm in your hands," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You guess? What's to guess? I may not look it, but I know women's hearts perfectly!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, you are a girl, after all… I guess."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Watch it with those guesses, buddy! I'm not sure I like what you're implying!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose cleared her throat and thrust out her chest. Compared to Mahiru, who Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    saw every day, the result was underwhelming at best. Amane awkwardly stared at the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ground.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Regardless of what he personally thought, Chitose was popular with guys.
    <p></p>
    Personality wise, she was cheerful and friendly, and she talked to everyone without playing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    favorites, so hers was a different kind of popularity than Mahiru's. She got along with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boys and girls alike. She really was the epitome of a life-of-the-party kind of person.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She had apparently been a member of the track-and-field club in middle school, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her slender build and toned legs certainly didn't hurt her popularity. It was a verifiable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fact that her legs were beautiful, so much so that Itsuki had warned other guys in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school that he'd get angry if they stared at her too much.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, right, right," Chitose chittered. "Something for a cute girl, let's see…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There were definitely times when she got too friendly, but Amane wouldn't deny that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose was cute. He could understand why other guys in school liked her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You know," Chitose added, "that glum attitude of yours is seriously gonna give<p></p>
    <p></p>
    people the wrong idea."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Gee, thanks for your concern," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fine, fine. So you're giving something to a girl, right? Well, what kind of girl?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose's question didn't leave him much room to maneuver, but Amane knew that if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was careless with what he told her, she wouldn't let him live it down, so he chose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his words gingerly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She's an acquaintance of mine, and she's relatively young. Beyond that, I'm exercising<p></p>
    <p></p>
    my right to remain silent."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh… if you won't tell me her about her personality or what she likes, even I can't come<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up with any ideas, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Can't you just tell me some things that you would like to get as a gift? Then I'll choose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from among them."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I get it; you don't want to tell me anything about her. Fine, we'll do it your way."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose made a good point, but if he told her any more, she would know that Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was close to a girl their age, and it was likely that the conversation would veer off in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    strange and uncomfortable direction from there. If he really slipped up, Chitose might<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even end up figuring out that he was talking about Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wanted to avoid that if at all possible, so he'd decided not to tell her anything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that wasn't strictly necessary. Chitose also seemed to understand that he wouldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    willingly reveal much more, and thankfully, she was kind enough to back off on the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    questions.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm, let's see… I don't know what type of relationship you have with her, but if she's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an acquaintance you speak with fairly often, I'm assuming she would be happy to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    receive something from a person who's about as close to her as I am to you. In that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    case, generally a consumable or everyday item that's not too expensive should be good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Itsuki told me pretty much the same thing," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Obviously. He understands how girls think. Now, if you're looking for a casual gift,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some sweets and a handkerchief or some small item might be good. If I got an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expensive accessory from you, Amane, I'd totally be like 'A bribe?!' or something."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't think I would get anything out of bribing you, though."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After shooting Amane a glance that seemed to be asking for some sort of recompense<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for her help, Chitose smiled and answered, "Well, you've got that right. Anyway, little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    things like that are safe."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Gotcha."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You sound kinda unsatisfied." Chitose cocked her head.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not that I'm not satisfied, but…" Amane trailed off. In truth, he just wasn't sure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Mahiru would appreciate the sort of gift that he would select. She probably had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    impeccable taste, and she seemed like the type to choose things that combined quality<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and functionality. Amane wasn't sure if his choice would measure up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose could sense a slight hesitation in Amane's demeanor, and she hummed a bit to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself. "…Let's see… Another option might be… something cute?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Such as?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Depends on the person's tastes. For example, a stuffed animal or a keychain with an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    adorable character on it. I think giving her something like that might work."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane blinked back at Chitose after hearing the unexpected suggestion, and Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smiled knowingly. "Most girls enjoy cute things, you see. There are even some people<p></p>
    <p></p>
    who keep collecting stuffed animals long after they grow up, and lots of girls like them<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in general, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…A stuffed animal, huh…?" Amane didn't know whether Mahiru had any girly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    interests, but she did wear clothes decorated with cute frills and ornaments, so she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably didn't hate cuter things like stuffed animals.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could certainly imagine Mahiru being happy to receive a plush toy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, do I sense some interest?" Chitose smirked. Apparently, she had caught the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    minute change that had come over Amane. He nodded, though he was still unsure, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    let out a small sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…But it'll be too weird for me to buy a stuffed animal, I think," Amane admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's a present; you're not buying it for yourself. What's the problem?" Chitose asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, a guy my age, carrying a stuffed animal to the register…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really are pathetic, you know that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm-hmm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no denying it, but it still hurt Amane to hear it. He ought to be able to get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    over such a petty hang-up, but even walking into a store that carried stuffed animals<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by himself was enough to make him feel embarrassed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Fortunately, Chitose was with him today. Amane thought he might be able to convince<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her to accompany him to a shop on the way home. It certainly wasn't out of the question,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Chitose, come with me," said Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whatcha mean?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Please accompany me to go shopping."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm, I wonder if I should…" It was just like Chitose to tease him like this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, she didn't really have any intention of refusing Amane's request, but there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could be no doubt that she was putting on a deliberate act, both to make fun of Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and to force him to beg for her help.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm asking you, please. I'm really counting on you," Amane pleaded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mmm, I guess I could go… By the way, Amane, I feel like eating something sweet. And<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the crepe stand in front of the station has a super-delicious-looking limited-time<p></p>
    <p></p>
    item…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Please allow me to treat you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yay!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane grimaced at Chitose's clever manipulation, but he realized it was a small price<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to pay for her help. It was way better to pay for one crepe than to go into a cutesy shop<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all on his own. Amane let out a powerful sigh as he looked at Chitose, who was grinning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    impishly, then mentally calculated his approximate budget based on what was in his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wallet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After consulting Itsuki and Chitose, Amane had at last made a decision on what to give<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru for her birthday. Staring at the back of the girl in question, a nervous<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression overtook Amane's face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As compensation for a deluxe crepe from the shop in front of the station, the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Wintertime Limited Edition Berry Berry Special to be exact, Amane had asked Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for one more thing. It and the actual present were now sitting in a bag together. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    problem was that Amane was completely at a loss for when he should give the gift to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The birthday girl was fixing dinner as usual, with no change in demeanor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't know what was on the menu, but it had the air of Japanese food and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certainly didn't seem like anything special. She seemed relaxed as she went about her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    preparations.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had made no indication at all that today was anything but another regular day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was acting so normal that Amane wondered if perhaps she even knew.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Mahiru started setting the table, Amane couldn't help but notice that her face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    remained completely unchanged. The two ate an extremely typical dinner and held a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    totally normal conversation. Through it all, Amane remained completely unsure of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    when best to present her with the gifts he'd gotten. Frowning, he glanced in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    direction of the paper bag hidden behind his sofa.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He decided to wait until they had cleaned up after dinner and returned to the living<p></p>
    <p></p>
    room, when he could take a seat beside Mahiru on his two-person sofa. She'd brought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some books to look over after their meal, so that seemed as good a time as any.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    True to her nickname, the angel was just as beautiful when she was reading.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without knowing why, Amane hesitated a little to sit next to her, but even if he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hesitated, there was no way around it, so he grabbed the paper gift bag from its hiding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    place and sat down next to Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Immediately, the girl's head snapped up. Whether she'd noticed Amane's presence or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heard the sound of the crinkling paper bag was unclear. Either way, her caramel-coloured eyes
    <p></p>
    turned toward Amane before shifting to what he was holding.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked confused, as if she still hadn't realized that this was about her birthday.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here. For you." Amane placed the bag on Mahiru's knees, and the girl's expression<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grew even more puzzled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What is this?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's your birthday, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's true… but wait, how did you know that? I don't remember telling anyone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was suddenly on guard.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Remember when you dropped your school ID in my apartment?" Amane reminded<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She seemed to understand, and her normal expression returned. "I really wish you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hadn't gone to the trouble. I… don't celebrate my birthday."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was certain that he'd heard a bit of cold detachment in Mahiru's voice when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she spoke. The look in her eyes told him that even the word birthday was something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she avoided.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I see, he thought. So the reason why she didn't act any differently, even though it's her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    birthday, wasn't because she forgot… She's been purposely ignoring it. Something about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it must bother her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane figured that if that wasn't the case, Mahiru wouldn't have spoken like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay then, call it an expression of gratitude for everything you do for me. I just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decided to give you something to repay you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Setting aside any mention of Mahiru's birthday, Amane pressed the bag on her,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    justifying it as his way of thanking her for her daily kindnesses. She cooked delicious<p></p>
    <p></p>
    meals for him every evening and helped him with his cleaning sometimes. When it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    came down to it, Mahiru did a lot to take care of Amane. He wanted to repay that debt<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in whatever small way possible.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane held out the present to Mahiru, but she shrank away. First, she looked confused,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    then she frowned at Amane's determination. Finally, she accepted the gift bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, can I open it?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru nodded and gingerly pulled out the box that was inside the paper bag, then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she carefully untied the ribbon and removed the wrapping paper.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something about watching Mahiru open the gift made Amane extremely nervous.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Inside the box was the hand cream Itsuki had suggested. It was nestled in a largish box<p></p>
    <p></p>
    alongside some sweets. Apparently, it'd been some kind of set. It wasn't the kind of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hand cream that smelled particularly nice, nor was it all that stylish. Instead, it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the scentless kind that was gentle on the skin. That way, it wouldn't cause any trouble<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while doing housework. This was the sort that was advertised as moisture-retaining.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had made sure to check the reviews of the product on the Internet, so he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certain of its efficacy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, sorry it's nothing too crazy. I just thought that since you do a lot of housework,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    your hands might get dry. They had scented ones, too, but I thought you might have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some of those already. Apparently, it's effective and easy on the skin."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It is… quite practical," Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I thought you would value practicality over anything else," answered Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, you're right. Thank you very much." Mahiru smiled slightly, as if she understood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's reasoning. A little less nervous now, Amane's expression softened a bit as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    well. It seemed like he'd made a good impression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was one more present, though, and Amane felt embarrassed to have Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    open this one in front of him for some reason. He'd hoped that she would only notice<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it after she had gone back home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, Mahiru was peering into the paper bag, looking as if she had already noticed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that there was one more thing hiding within it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What, a second one?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah. Yeah, there is. It's a bonus; I picked it out myself," Amane answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What does that mean?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Exactly what I said."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane averted his eyes. Mahiru tilted her head in confusion for an instant, then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    promptly pulled the second gift from the bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    To purposefully disguise this other present, Amane had intentionally wrapped it in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    paper the same color as the interior of the bag. He'd hoped that would make it stand<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out less—and that Mahiru would only notice it later when he wasn't around.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unfortunately, it was large enough that Amane should've known it would be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    impossible to miss. There was honestly no way Mahiru could have overlooked it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unlike the hand cream, this present didn't come in a box, just a polyester bag. It was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just about the right size to fit comfortably in Mahiru's arms. The bag was tied up with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a navy-blue ribbon, and Amane watched Mahiru undo that carefully as well,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wondering if it would be all right for him to stand up from his seat. Finally, Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    carefully pulled out what lay inside.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She held the bag's contents up gently with both hands, blinking her large eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dramatically, looking truly surprised.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…A bear?" Mahiru mumbled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was a stuffed animal. Not too large, it was perfectly proportioned for an elementary<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school student. Its light-colored fur was soft, much like Mahiru's own hair. A light-blue<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ribbon was tied around the toy's neck to form a collar. It had a rather cherubic look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stitched onto its face, and the round, cute button eyes had a luster to them that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reflected Mahiru's face as they stared at her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Doubtless, the girl was wondering why Amane had given her such a thing when she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was in high school. The truth was that Amane had taken a risk and chosen it based on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose's advice that girls liked cute things no matter how old they were.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, he had been much too embarrassed to go buy the bear alone, so Chitose had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    come with him to make the purchase, though only in exchange for the deluxe crepe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from the shop in front of the station.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose's smiling face had loomed over Amane throughout the whole process of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    buying the bear and getting it wrapped. In the end, he couldn't help but think it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    might've been better if he'd just gone alone. Though, there was nothing he could do<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about it now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I thought it looked like something a girl would like," Amane mumbled to no one in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    particular, scratching his head. He was terrible at stuff like this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The last time he'd gotten a present for a member of the opposite sex was when he'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    given gifts to his mother as a little kid. Amane had never once thought he'd have to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pick something out for a girl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So it doesn't faze her to get a cute stuffed animal from a boy, huh…?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Risking a quick glance at Mahiru, Amane saw her staring directly into the bear's face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He couldn't tell from her expression whether she was happy, only that her eyes were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fixed on the stuffed animal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean… If you don't like it, you can just toss it," Amane said, hoping to diffuse the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    situation with some light humor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru turned sharply toward him and drew her eyebrows tightly into a frown. "I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would never!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "S-sure, I, uh, didn't think you would or anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The response had been so absolute that Amane couldn't help but flinch and barely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    managed to nod in answer. Mahiru looked back at the bear in her hands again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I would never do such a cruel thing. I'll treasure it." Slender arms embraced the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stuffed bear, as if to wrap it up entirely. Amane couldn't decide if Mahiru looked more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like a child with a favorite toy or a mother protecting an infant. Either way, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certainly embraced the bear enthusiastically, looking down at the thing as though it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were the most precious object in the world.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's face was not the stony mask she kept up at school, nor was it the face she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    often wore when she was exasperated with Amane. This time it was peaceful, soft, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    somewhat affectionate—an unmistakably sweet expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt an innocence in her, and her pure smile was beautiful enough to take his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    breath away. She was really exceptionally cute.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I shouldn't be staring, Amane thought. Mahiru was liable to notice if he kept looking at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was certain that he wasn't in love, but seeing a beautiful girl make a face like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that, and knowing that he was the cause of it, undeniably made his heart throb. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked so adorable as she sat there with a faint smile, hugging the stuffed animal to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her chest. Anyone who saw her would've been captivated by the sight. Amane certainly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was, despite his usual reservations.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just pressing a palm to her face would've made it immediately apparent how much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    warmer it was than usual. Embarrassed after being so open with her emotions, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    swore under her breath. "…Damn." The word was so quiet it could barely be heard.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Fortunately, Mahiru did not seem to have noticed how Amane was looking at her,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because her face was half-buried in the stuffed animal that she was clutching to her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She still looked extremely sweet, and Amane was worried he would say something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    strange in spite of himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm really glad you like it." Thankfully, Amane managed to keep what he said brief.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Quickly, Mahiru turned to face him. "This is the first time I've ever received something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like this."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? With how popular you are, I thought you'd be getting presents like this all the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    time…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What do you take me for…?" It came as a relief to see Mahiru's usual behavior return,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but that was only because Amane couldn't see her current expression behind the bear.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I never told anyone when my birthday was," Mahiru continued, looking back down<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at the stuffed animal. "I hate that day, so I don't really share it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's expression softened as she looked at her gift, though her words remained<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sharp. The apparent dissonance set Amane on edge a bit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Normally, I hate getting presents from strangers, so I don't accept them," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're accepting this, though," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Fujimiya…," Mahiru said quietly, "you're not a stranger."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Face still half-buried in fur, Mahiru looked up toward Amane again. She wore a dreamy,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    innocent expression. It was captivating, and as Amane gazed at the angel sitting on his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couch, he realized he was in trouble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was so cute that Amane found himself reaching unbidden to stroke her hair,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and he had to quickly stuff his hand behind his back before he did something really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    awkward.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …That was close! If Amane had let his guard down, he probably would've started<p></p>
    <p></p>
    patting Mahiru on the head right then and there. Doing something so inappropriate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would have destroyed everything he'd built with her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What is it?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "N-nothing," Amane replied shyly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Perhaps Mahiru had seen his arm move, or maybe she'd noticed his obvious distress<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as he struggled to keep his alarming feelings from bubbling to the surface. Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    head tilted to one side in puzzlement. That simple movement was enough to leave<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane speechless, and it occurred to him that beautiful girls possessed a terrifying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    power. Still, he felt embarrassed for being so captivated by Mahiru's cuteness. He was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    also confident that if he told her how he felt, she would just be confused.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something about the feeling instilled a sense of danger in Amane, and he did his best<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to push it deep down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you very much, Fujimiya," Mahiru said in a soft voice, but Amane had already<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turned away from her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, hey, Amane, how'd it go with that girl you got the present for?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Obviously Chitose was going to pry, since Amane had convinced her to come along<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shopping with him. The day after Mahiru's birthday, Amane was confronted by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose's grinning inquiry.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose was in a different class but had come to his classroom after school. That alone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't much of an issue, but hers was the sort of smile that made Amane feel like she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was up to something. Today especially, he felt the urge to turn and run.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing happened—at least, not anything like you're imagining," Amane answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was the truth. He definitely wasn't holding on to any amorous feelings, and he hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    given Mahiru the present because he hoped it would lead to the start of something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more. Sure, she'd graciously accepted the gifts, but there had certainly been no<p></p>
    <p></p>
    romantic developments of the kind that Chitose anticipated.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now hold on," Itsuki interrupted, "The fact that you were so concerned about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone at all is a pretty rare thing, you know. You suddenly have some acquaintance<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that you seem involved with, and it's a girl. Very suspicious."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's nothing like that." Amane knew he had to shut this down now. He was happy that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had been pleased with her gifts, but he was starting to think that bringing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    other people into the situation was more trouble than it'd been worth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Not wanting to feed their curiosity anymore, Amane had answered as bluntly as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    possible, but Itsuki had his hand to his mouth, as if he was pondering something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Hmm… say, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What is it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is it possible that the person you gave the present to is… your neighbor?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki was smart and very perceptive, which at times like these could be a real pain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What makes you think that?" Amane asked nervously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, she's the only person I could think of that bothers taking care of you. And you're<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not from around here, so you don't know many people. Plus, you don't hang out with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    many girls. She brought you dinner that other day, right? I was thinking that maybe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this was about you wanting to return the favor."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm… Amane has been looking very healthy recently, right, Chi?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, I thought so, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She must be bringing him meals pretty frequently, huh? I wonder if that's why he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wanted to give her a birthday present, to thank her?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane fought to maintain a blank expression as Itsuki perfectly described the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    situation to Chitose. It was so accurate that it was like he had been there to watch it all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    go down. Sometimes Itsuki was scary like that. Amane could see why his friend was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so popular. He was a bit of a show-off but also smart and thoughtful. Amane just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wished Itsuki would save the grandstanding for his girlfriend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What an overactive imagination…," Amane interjected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you won't fess up, so imaginations are all we've got. C'mon, spill it!" Itsuki pressed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Who knows…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're holdin' out on us!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So stingy!" Chitose chimed in agreement.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No matter what anyone said, Amane wasn't planning on confirming the truth. If he let<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anything slip, Itsuki and Chitose would never stop hounding him until he'd spit out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the whole story. Really, Itsuki was only the tip of the iceberg; Amane was in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    presence of a high school girl who loved gossip, especially when it came to romantic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    affairs. While there wasn't the slightest bit of romance to be found here, if Chitose got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one whiff of the person involved, Amane would never hear the end of it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sighing in exasperation, Amane finished packing his things and shouldered his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    backpack. He'd decided on a strategic retreat, before his two friends gave him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heartburn.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "See ya. You two can go ahead and flirt all you like in private," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We were gonna do that whether you said to or not!" Itsuki shouted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Itsuki, weren't we gonna tail him and try to meet the girl in question…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, uh, you probably shouldn't discuss your operation in front of the target… And<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anyway, there's nothing to see. Even if there was, you two would never make it past<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the lobby!" Amane scolded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Tch!" Chitose's lips curled into a cute pout, but her eyes were serious. Apparently, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really had been planning on tailing Amane. Nervously hurrying out of the room,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane left his friends behind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…That was a close one," Amane grumbled without thinking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What was?" Mahiru asked him curiously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was still a little early to make dinner, but Amane and Mahiru had gone shopping and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    come back to his apartment. They'd been relaxing for a bit, when Mahiru overheard<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane talking to himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had been acting the same as usual; there was no trace of the girl who'd been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so enamored with the stuffed bear. The same placid expression remained, and Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wondered if perhaps he'd dreamed up the whole birthday incident. Actually, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    preferred her this way. He wasn't sure his heart could stand regularly seeing her look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at him the way she had the other day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, well, Itsuki and Chitose were suspicious about the present."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane intended to explain that he'd consulted them about the present, but Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed to remember Itsuki's name, and she exhaled, saying "Ah, I see" as if she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    understood.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it didn't seem like the sort of thing you would buy on your own."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not what I was concerned about…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, no one thought Amane was capable of getting a gift for a girl. If he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    being honest, he really didn't think he'd ever experience the many sweet and bitter<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feelings that were supposed to accompany love all at once.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My shopping is my business. Why does everyone think that way about me anyway?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Certainly, Mahiru was cute, and yesterday he'd felt a desire to reach out and touch her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That much he couldn't deny, but what young man wouldn't have felt that way? Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was outrageously beautiful, after all. Amane had been caught up in her beauty; that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was all. Nothing about what had happened was evidence he had any deeper feelings.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was a great person, but Amane was not interested in her like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He glanced over at Mahiru. She was just as beautiful as ever, but Amane's heart didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pound like it had the night before. Once again, he reminded himself that he didn't care<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for Mahiru in any meaningful way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Worried that Mahiru would say something if she caught Amane staring at her, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked down at his phone instead. When he did, he realized he'd received a ton of new<p></p>
    <p></p>
    texts. Thinking it was probably Itsuki, Amane decided to check them, but it turned out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they hadn't come from his friend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane frowned at the sender's name: SHIHOKO.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was one of only three female contacts in Amane's phone. There was Chitose,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, and… Amane's mother.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Wondering what she could possibly want, Amane tapped the message thread. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hated dealing with his mother's high-strung questions, always asking him how exams<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were going or whether he needed anything. He could barely handle Chitose, and yet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some members of his family were just like her. In fact, Chitose might become very<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much like Amane's mother as she got older. Shihoko wasn't so bad that Amane outright<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hated her, but he couldn't stand his mother's personality.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I brought some fruit back from Grandfather's, so I'm going to share it with you, Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'm sending it over, so be at your place on Saturday afternoon! I won't forgive you if you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    refuse delivery or aren't there to get it, okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So you can just decide my plans all on your own…?" Amane muttered. Now, he didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    actually have any plans for Saturday, but he thought his mother ought to have at least<p></p>
    <p></p>
    contacted him a little earlier.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did something happen?" Mahiru must have heard Amane's whisperings, because she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked over at him with her usual calm expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My mom picked some fruit at my grandpa's place, and she's sending it here on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Saturday afternoon. Probably apples and stuff," Amane explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do you peel your apples?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I guess I could do that, with a peeler."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That would peel them, but… it'll take off a lot of the flesh, too, so it's a little wasteful."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's words sounded like something Amane's mother would say, and he tried to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    swallow that thought before it surfaced.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If it comes down to it, we can just eat them whole," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How savage."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's a pain to peel them." Amane shrugged and grinned haplessly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're such a mess." Despite Mahiru sounding annoyed and giving a rather brutal<p></p>
    <p></p>
    assessment of Amane's table manners, the way she held herself also showed some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    understanding. "I guess it's all the same once you eat them."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You know, I'm not sure I'll be able to eat them all before they go bad. Do you want<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some, too?" asked Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure, I'd be happy to take some. Fruit is expensive, after all." It was kind of a domestic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thing to say, but then again, that was the kind of person Mahiru was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Saturday, right? In that case, I'll make us lunch beforehand as thanks," Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But you're always taking care of me already," Amane protested.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Like I've told you, I really don't mind making food for you, Fujimiya." Mahiru smiled<p></p>
    <p></p>
    very slightly. Somehow, the little grin made Amane feel awkward. It called to mind the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    events of the previous day, and Amane couldn't help but avert his eyes from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    beautiful angel in his apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…All right, thanks," he replied curtly.<p></p>
    <p></p>

    
    <H2>10 – Mother Invades</H2>
    Asking Mahiru to pick up her portion of the fruit as soon as the package arrived turned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out to be a big mistake. When Amane heard the sound of the intercom and the high-pitched,
    <p></p>
    mischievous voice that called "Aaa-maaa-neee!" through it, he understood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he was in trouble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been very grateful for Mahiru's proposal to make lunch for him on Saturday.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It had seemed a veritable blessing from heaven at the time. Truly, the carbonara she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whipped up had been delicious. The thick-bodied sauce and the kick of black pepper<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were a perfect match, and it'd been tremendously tasty.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru hadn't done anything wrong. Those at fault were Amane himself for failing to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    recognize in advance what his mother had meant by telling him to be home on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Saturday for the delivery and that irksome, surprise-loving woman herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Um, Fujimiya? Is that the delivery…?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nope. That would be my mother. She's probably using her duplicate key to get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    through the front door and is heading up right now," Amane explained. Thinking back<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on it, it had been his own mistake to take what his mother had said at face value. One<p></p>
    <p></p>
    way or another, she always created situations that allowed her to come by and check<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in on him. Amane's mother could never resist employing a little misdirection.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Uh, your mother?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She probably came to see whether I'm getting along okay… and she didn't tell me she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was coming. Probably because she knew I would clean up in advance."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh-huh…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know it's all a bit hard to swallow, but that doesn't matter right now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Right now, the problem was what to do with Mahiru. If Amane's mother had still been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in the lobby downstairs, he could have sent Mahiru home, but that was out of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    question now that she was approaching his door. At the same time, his mother was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sure to get the wrong idea if he invited her into his apartment and she came across<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru. There was no doubting that Mahiru would hate that as much as Amane would.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The longer Amane puzzled over what to do, the closer his mother was getting to just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    barging right in.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I can't believe this is happening… Amane did have an idea, but he didn't like it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm sorry, Shiina, but could you please hide in my bedroom?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, wh-what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Take your stuff with you, and once I find some way to get my mom outside, you can<p></p>
    <p></p>
    go back home. I'm really sorry, but please?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With no other viable option, Amane took the helm and steered Mahiru into concealing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself. Thankfully, they'd already finished cleaning up after lunch, so that wouldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be a giveaway. If he hid her shoes in the shoe closet, they wouldn't be discovered, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru could just bring her personal effects into Amane's room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The plan was to let Amane's mom to make a quick inspection of the apartment while<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was hiding. Amane would mention to his mother that he really wanted to eat<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her home cooking, something that'd probably keep her too busy to push her way into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whatever it took, Amane had to keep his mother from breaching the bedroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He would purposely request that his mother cook something that used an ingredient<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he didn't have in his refrigerator. If the two of them went out shopping together, that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would provide Mahiru with a window to escape.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hurriedly explained to Mahiru that such a scheme was the only option as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    handed her his extra key and asked her to cooperate with the greatest sincerity he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could muster.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "O-okay," she said, nodding in bewilderment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In truth, the storage room was also an option, but Amane didn't want a girl to wait in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there. It had no heating, which meant it was quite cold this time of year. Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bedroom had a proper heater, as well as soft cushions. It wouldn't do to have Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sitting on a bare floor while she shivered from the cold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…All right, I'm counting on you. I have to deal with my mom, so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even before meeting his mother, Amane looked dejected. He headed for the entrance<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while Mahiru quietly slipped into the bedroom. After making sure that the angel was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hidden, Amane reluctantly opened the front door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My goodness Amane, that took you long enough. I'm glad to see you're looking well. I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was starting to wonder if you were asleep."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was Amane's mother, standing just outside his apartment. He hadn't seen her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    since summer break.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Although she was a parent, it would have been difficult to tell from her looks alone. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't just that her face looked young, she never acted her age, either. She wore the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    same sort of happy expression she often had back when Amane was still living at home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah, I'm perfectly fine, so how about heading home?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How can you say that to your own mother? It took me several hours to get here, you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    know? Don't I even get a thank-you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you very much for traveling a great distance, now please go home."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come now, don't say such things. It's not very endearing. You should act more like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shuuto, your father!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Men don't need to be endearing, do we?" While Amane had spat his words acidly, his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mother, Shihoko, didn't seem bothered at all, instead breaking into a fit of laughter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You've really hit your rebellious phase!" she said. "I hope you're not planning on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    having me stand outside all day. I'm coming in, okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wait, nobody said you could—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Have you forgotten that your father and I pay the rent on this place?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was nothing Amane could do to argue or refuse his mother once she'd played<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that card. Reluctantly, he allowed her to enter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    To keep her from going into the bedroom, Amane casually guided his mother to walk<p></p>
    <p></p>
    past the bedroom door and into the living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "By the way, you really should tell me beforehand when you plan on visiting," said<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now, I wouldn't be able to get a proper picture of my son's living situation if I didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    show up unannounced, would I?" Shihoko replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ugh… Look, there's no problem, okay? I'm keeping the place clean."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You certainly are; I'm surprised. You never kept your room clean at home, but you're<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doing better than I'd expected. I'm surprised." Shihoko nodded seriously, looking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    genuinely astonished as she surveyed the living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The unspoken truth was that his place was only clean because Mahiru had helped<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane tidy up. Her advice and constant scolding was a big part of how his place had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    managed to stay clean, too. Really, Mahiru deserved most of the credit, but there was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    no way Amane was going to tell his mother that now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your skin looks good, too; you must be eating well," Shihoko observed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yeah," Amane admitted, unable to meet his mother's eyes. Even his improved health<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was something he owed to the angel.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're even cooking properly, huh. Oh, but it looks like you're cooking for two?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko's manicured finger was pointing at his dish rack. Two people had eaten lunch,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so naturally there were two sets of dishes. Carelessly, Amane had forgotten to put<p></p>
    <p></p>
    them away. He should've remembered how perceptive his mother could be.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I had a friend over." Amane's answer was not quite a lie. He'd spoken as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    indifferently as he was able, doing his best to stop himself from shaking. It was fair to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    say that he and Mahiru had built up to something resembling a friendship, so it wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exactly untrue. There was the small matter of hiding that the friend in question was a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm," Shihoko replied with a tone that suggested she didn't really accept that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    explanation at face value. She scanned the living room again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose you get a passing mark. You're doing so well, I can hardly believe you're a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boy living on his own," Amane's mother finally conceded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Somehow, Amane had been able to deceive her, though only just barely. Strangely, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    felt a chill run down his spine, and he was sweating bullets. On the other hand, maybe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he shouldn't have been so surprised to have passed his mother's inspection. Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really had turned some things around for him, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "See, there was nothing for you to worry about, Mom."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose not; though I can hardly believe it. You could barely do anything for yourself<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at home. You've certainly grown up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm basically an adult," Amane replied, though inwardly, he scoffed at himself for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    having the audacity to say such a thing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good job," Shihoko praised, smiling.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It made Amane a little uncomfortable to hear that, since of course he hadn't done any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of it on his own. There was no way he could risk telling his mother the truth, however,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so he would have to leave things as they were and try to get her out of there.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She's pretty much finished her evaluation, right? I wonder if I can get her to leave<p></p>
    <p></p>
    without saying anything about wanting to eat her cooking or whatever, Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That just leaves the bedroom check, I suppose," Shihoko mused nonchalantly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's eyes went wide at the drop of that bomb. Mahiru was still in there. If his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mother found a girl hiding in the bedroom, a far greater disaster would ensue than if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had just revealed Mahiru from the get-go.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, don't joke around. Even if you're my mom, I don't want you digging around in my<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bedroom."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh? Something in there you're feeling embarrassed about?" Shihoko prodded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There's probably one or two embarrassing things in any high school guy's room, if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you think about it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So you admit it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I admit it. Please don't go in there."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though it was shameful, there'd been no other choice. Amane had been forced to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    go along with his mother's assumption to keep her from entering the bedroom. If she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    discovered Mahiru in Amane's room, she would most assuredly get the wrong idea.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For both his own sake and Mahiru's, Amane needed to avoid that at all costs.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane's mother saw him blocking the door to his room, desperately trying to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    keep her from getting through, she could tell right away that he was hiding something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Closing in on her son, Shihoko said, "I suppose you are grown up, if you're hiding those<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sorts of things from your parents."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If it came down to it, Amane was prepared to keep his mom out by force if necessary,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though he admittedly didn't like that idea. He stood ready to stop her, but then…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thump. There came a noise from inside the bedroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What are you hiding?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It has nothing to do with you, Mom."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So you say." A wide grin spread across Shihoko's face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was the kind of coercive smile that could not be denied. Amane became extremely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    uncomfortable every time she looked at him like this. It had a way of sapping his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    willpower to oppose her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane groaned, and Shihoko saw an opening. She put her hand on the doorknob to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his room, and by the time Amane noticed, it was far too late. Shihoko slipped past<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane, intent on discovering the source of the noise on the other side of the door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What met her eyes beyond that barrier that Amane had failed to protect was the figure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of a beautiful girl. She was leaning her back against the side of the bed while hugging<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a cushion to her chest. The girl's eyes were closed, and her breaths were a gentle<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rhythm. Mahiru had dozed off by the time Shihoko discovered her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A warm room with a heater running and a full stomach after lunch were the perfect<p></p>
    <p></p>
    conditions for an afternoon nap. Amane couldn't help but wonder whether Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    often slept in boys' rooms, but all this really confirmed was that she found Amane to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be harmless enough to doze off in his bedroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He couldn't exactly blame her for it. Sitting motionless so as not to make any noise had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably gotten real boring real fast.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The main problem was, obviously, Shihoko, who had arrived at just the wrong moment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to witness a situation she was sure to misunderstand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Had he been the third party, Amane would have gotten the wrong idea, too. He would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have assumed they were so intimate that Mahiru had no problem drifting off for a nap<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in his room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Grimacing all the while, Amane glanced over at his mother and saw that her eyes were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sparkling. He could only imagine the commotion she was about to raise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh my, Amane, you've got such an adorable girlfriend!" Shihoko shrieked in her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    youthful voice. "This isn't the kind of girl you can just hide away in a corner, you know!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt a headache coming on.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She had immediately jumped to possibly the worst conclusion available, and to make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    matters worse, she was clearly very excited about the idea that her son was dating<p></p>
    <p></p>
    such a lovely girl. There was no doubt that even Amane's mother was smitten with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's beauty.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked so vulnerable when she was asleep. The practiced air of elegant<p></p>
    <p></p>
    refinement that she always wore like a mask had melted away, revealing the full<p></p>
    <p></p>
    captivating nature of her looks. Her cute face had never looked more peaceful—or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more pretty.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had grown somewhat accustomed to Mahiru's appearance, but seeing her like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this, he was once again struck by her incredible charm. Her cherubic face held such an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    innocent serenity. Once again, he felt the urge to reach out and touch her. Her sleeping<p></p>
    <p></p>
    figure, hugging Amane's cushion tight, awakened many desires in him that were best<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kept private.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This truly captivating girl was Amane's girlfriend, or so his mother thought. It was no<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wonder she was excited.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose the reason you didn't want your mother looking in this room is because<p></p>
    <p></p>
    your girlfriend is here? Look at you, growing up right before my eyes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not it! You've got it all wrong! She's not my girlfriend or anything!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come now, you don't have to make excuses! Your mother has no intention of opposing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    your relationship, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I'm telling you, that's not the issue here! We're not in a romantic relationship!<p></p>
    <p></p>
    You've got it totally wrong!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, whether I'm right or wrong, she's in your bedroom right now, isn't she?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's because you showed up all of the sudden! We were just hanging out in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    living room, but I knew you would misunderstand!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You see, the problem with that excuse is that you would never let a girl you don't like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into your apartment. And I really don't think a girl would just waltz right on into the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment of someone she didn't like, would she?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane struggled to find a way to argue the issue. His mother was right; Amane was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    awfully territorial about his living spaces and wasn't inclined to let just anyone into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his domain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The first time Mahiru had come in, she'd practically forced her way, but ever since<p></p>
    <p></p>
    then, he'd welcomed her over, even when she wasn't coming to cook for him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I guess that means I really do like her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As far as Amane was concerned, he was sure he liked Mahiru for her personality, not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her appearance. He enjoyed that seemingly contradictory part to her. There was a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    biting and honest side of her that she didn't show at school, and yet she found it hard<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to be open about her feelings. He liked her curt and annoyingly helpful attitude and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the reserved way she conducted herself. When she was taken by surprise, she would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    get flustered, and the mask would drop momentarily, which was another thing he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enjoyed. Most of all, Amane especially liked that rare angelic smile that he'd only seen<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cross her face a few times. He supposed that each of those attributes were all precious<p></p>
    <p></p>
    parts of Mahiru's appeal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he had to say whether that was a feeling of romantic love, Amane would have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    insisted that it was something else, but he couldn't deny that Mahiru was a wonderful<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girl for many reasons.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I care about her as a friend. Not every relationship between members of the opposite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sex has to be romantic, you know. And I'm pretty sure she doesn't feel that way, either."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was not the kind of mama's boy who would obediently play along with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whatever Shihoko said. Plus, Mahiru would certainly object to the suggestion that she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had feelings for him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now, you don't know that, Amane! Aren't you being rather presumptuous, thinking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you know exactly what her heart wants?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What can I say to get you to understand that our relationship is not like that, Mom…?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shiina, please, help me out here…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No matter how he tried to explain, Amane's mother had already made up her mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane pressed a finger to his forehead, stumped on what to do. With all possible<p></p>
    <p></p>
    urgency, he wished Mahiru would just wake up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nn…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Either Amane's unspoken prayer had been heard or all the ruckus had, because<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyelids fluttered open, and she made a sweet noise as she raised her face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her flaxen hair slipped over her shoulders. The girl's shining eyes, the color of caramel,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were blurry with sleep, and she looked so vulnerable that it felt somehow wrong to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look directly at her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Maybe she wasn't quite fully awake yet as she looked up at Amane vacantly, her eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    still relaxed and drowsy. Amane pointedly stared in another direction.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shiina, I don't mind that you fell asleep, but there's been a misunderstanding, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    please help me clear things up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Misunderstanding…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, hey, Miss Girlfriend, what's your name?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was still clearly confused over what had happened, but Shihoko didn't hesitate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to approach her, beaming with an amiable, carefree smile and an overly familiar<p></p>
    <p></p>
    demeanor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was visibly flustered, still trying to get her bearings.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, uh, um…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's important to tell each other our names when we first meet, you know!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, I-I'm Mahiru Shiina…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, Mahiru, what a cute name that is! I am Shihoko; please don't be shy and call me<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by my first name, okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had reflexively given her name when pressed for it. She looked up at Amane,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her eyes begging him for rescue. Unfortunately, Amane was helpless. He had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hoping Mahiru would save him somehow. Regretfully, he shook his head. He knew that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    once his mother got started, there was really no stopping her. She was set on learning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more about Mahiru, and nothing would dissuade her now. It was unlikely she'd ever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    realize just how uncomfortable she was making the poor girl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A-all right, um… Mrs., that is, uh, Shihoko…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "See? That sounds more like my daughter-in-law."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fujimiya!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That could be referring to either of us, you know? Right, Amane?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mom, you're bothering Shiina."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, you mustn't be so formal with your sweet new girlfriend; call her by her first<p></p>
    <p></p>
    name!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko didn't seem inclined to listen to anything anyone said. Amane scowled at her,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but she didn't show any sign of letting up. Her smile was wide and utterly shameless.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, um, Shihoko?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, dear?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "He and I—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why, I don't know who you mean. He who?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…A-Amane and I; we aren't dating."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though she was obviously flustered by his mother's verbal assault, Mahiru tried<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her best to set the record straight. Unfortunately, she'd looked right at Amane and had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even been forced to call him by his first name, which was apparently exactly what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko had been after. The older woman's smile grew even wider.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I suppose it takes time for things like this to blossom. Something to look forward<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to," Shihoko said, quite presumptuously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Eh, ah, um, that's not…," Mahiru said, trying to object.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh no, I must have intruded just when things were getting good!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "U-um, I want you to let me explain properly! I don't have that kind of relationship<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with… Amane. We were just having lunch together because Amane can't cook!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What a wonderful bride you'll make, sweetie. My Amane set out to live on his own<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even though he's incapable of doing any kind of housework, you see. So I really do<p></p>
    <p></p>
    appreciate you supporting him."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, uh—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had put up a heroic effort, but she may as well have been banging her head<p></p>
    <p></p>
    against a wall at this point. The moment she'd mentioned visiting Amane's place,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooking there, and sitting at the same table as him, the sparkle in Shihoko's eyes had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    changed. The pushy mother somehow looked even more unhinged than usual to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once Shihoko got like this, he knew there was nothing he could do to stop her. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    only person who ever stood a chance was his father, Shuuto.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shiina, just give up. My mother won't listen to anyone when she gets like this."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can't be serious…" Mahiru sounded extremely dismayed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane realized that they weren't getting anywhere. Trying to explain the situation<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't working, and he clearly couldn't stop his mother's wild speculations.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "At any rate, my Amane did quite well to snag such a beauty. I'm surprised."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With Amane exhausted from arguing, and Mahiru having no clear idea what to do,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    both simply went quiet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was possible Amane's mother took their sudden silence as a sign of agreement,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though Shihoko had doubtlessly already assumed that their embarrassment was proof<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough of her suspicions. She was looking at Mahiru with no attempt to hide the wild<p></p>
    <p></p>
    curiosity in her eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What do you think, Mahiru? Can my Amane really make it, living on his own?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh… That's… Well…," Mahiru stammered. "…Enough to stay alive…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You should've just said I'll be fine!" Amane interjected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I remember the place being pretty bad," Mahiru reminded him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't bring that up. I'm keeping it clean now, aren't I?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And I've been helping you with the cleaning this whole time, haven't I?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's true, and I'm grateful for it," Amane admitted. "All of it, truly—the food, the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cleaning, and everything else." Mahiru was inarguably the reason that he'd been able<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to live so comfortably, and he would bow down in thanks to her without any hesitation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He knew that she wouldn't have done so much if she'd hated it, but he always strove<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to make his appreciate known.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As should've been expected by now, Amane's mother interpreted the exchange in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    different light.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well now, Amane, so it wasn't just today's lunch! Mahiru's been doing everything for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you this whole time, you useless child. The way you speak to each other—it's like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you're already living together!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No! How did you even reach that conclusion?! We only live next to each other!" Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fired back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Aha, so it was fate! Isn't that wonderful, Amane. You got me such a beautiful daughterin-law."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not denying that she's beautiful and talented, but I'm totally against calling it fate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or destiny or whatever!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Doesn't it sound more romantic that way?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not what I'm bothered by! I'm telling you we don't have a romantic relationship<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at all!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How persistent." Clearly, Shihoko was choosing to believe that Amane was still too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    embarrassed to admit the truth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's face contorted into a progressively deeper grimace, and he heaved his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heaviest sigh of the last few months. He couldn't recall how many times he'd suffered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at the hands of his mother's wild imagination. Shihoko was really the kind of woman<p></p>
    <p></p>
    who just did whatever she wanted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As for Mahiru, the one who'd been caught unawares by the full weight of Shihoko's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    overwhelming enthusiasm, she could do little else than look helplessly back and forth<p></p>
    <p></p>
    between Amane and his mother, utterly bewildered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, this is probably a parent's love talking, but my Amane isn't very good with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    words, and he isn't very up-front about his feelings, but he is faithful and gentlemanly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'd say he's a pretty good catch. Plus, he doesn't have any experience with girls, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you'll be able to get him to do whatever you want."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What on earth are you saying, Mom? Seriously, cut it out."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That last bit especially is none of her business, Amane thought angrily.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, it's true, isn't it? If not, then why haven't you had any other girlfriends? You<p></p>
    <p></p>
    resemble your father, so I don't think it's your looks. Maybe it's because you're a little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    immature?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's n-none of your business."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really should try harder to act cool in front of Mahiru, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I will not, and she's not interested, either," Amane protested.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, come now! Sweetie, you can train him to suit your own preferences, you know.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane cleans up pretty good if you dress him up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko, grinning madly, struck poor Mahiru again, who could do nothing but offer a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    vague sort of smile in return. Not even an angel could retaliate in a battle like this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's mother was truly something else.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mom, you're bothering her. Please go home."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What a big man you've become, telling your mother to go home."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm serious, please. It's really obvious that you're making her uncomfortable."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh? Is that true, Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't ask her; she'll definitely just say what you want to hear. Just this once, please<p></p>
    <p></p>
    head back. You can come back some other time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if you're going that far, I suppose I get the message. I did barge in while you were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    alone with your girlfriend, after all. It's only natural you'd be upset to lose your alone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fine, you can explain it however you like. Just hurry up and go!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was beyond tired of arguing with his mother, and this whole situation had to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be taking a toll on Mahiru as well. He looked over and saw that she also looked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exhausted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Vowing internally to shower her with appreciation later, Amane shooed his mother<p></p>
    <p></p>
    away and got a look of sour disapproval in return. Even so, Shihoko didn't make an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    effort to stay, so at least she kind of cared, though it was obvious her view of reality<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was still quite different.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, Mahiru, let's exchange contact information, shall we? I want a full report later on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    how Amane's doing, among other things."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, o-okay…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In a last-ditch effort, Shihoko tried to sink her hooks in again. Caught in the woman's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    powerful momentum, Mahiru wound up exchanging contact information with her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now Amane's mother would be able to reach her directly. The thought made Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want to press a hand to his forehead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Beaming wide, Shihoko gripped Mahiru's hand and reminded the girl to look after her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    son. Amane resolved to send his father a message later, asking him to rein Shihoko in.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm exhausted…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry; she's like a hurricane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko hadn't stayed all that long, but she'd left the two completely ragged.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After flumping down on the couch, Amane put his head in his hands and sighed deeply.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru gingerly took a seat, too, but her usually perfect posture was bent and haggard.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had thought that the angel could handle anyone, but even she had no energy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    left after the encounter with his mother. He was unsure if he should try to apologize.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I really didn't want to let her go home still believing the wrong thing," Amane admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, there's no real harm done…," Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I think there is… If she was acting like that, it probably means that she's taken a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    liking to you… One way or another, she's gonna be an issue…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was truly unfortunate that this was going to put a burden on Mahiru. Shihoko's love<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for all things adorable, coupled with her mistaking Mahiru for her son's girlfriend,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    almost certainly meant that Amane's mother would be finding new ways to poke her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nose where it didn't belong in the days to come. Trouble was on the horizon.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shihoko really cares about you a lot, doesn't she?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's a nice way to put it, but sometimes she really just refuses to listen…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    More than just an overly affectionate parent, Shihoko doted and fawned on Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even though he hated it. He knew he shouldn't complain too much, since it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably at least partly his own fault because he was such hopeless slob. It wasn't as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though he was ungrateful for all his mother had provided, but she could be a real pain<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in the butt, and he wished she'd give him more space.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…How nice," Mahiru mumbled quietly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane looked up at her. "What is?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your mother is quite a character but also very kind."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That means she's loud and loves to meddle."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Even so, I think it's nice."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's words weren't an empty compliment; she really did seem envious as she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mumbled and averted her eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A gloomy expression was plain on the girl's face. So much so that Amane thought she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    might break down into tears at the drop of a hat. Anyone could have sensed how fragile<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was right now. It was clearly more than simple exhaustion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru must have noticed Amane looking at her, because she suddenly looked up and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forced her lips into a small smile. Then, just as quickly, she regained her usual<p></p>
    <p></p>
    composure and leaned back against the sofa, something she rarely did.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What are you saying all of a sudden?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing… I was just thinking that it's been a while since anyone called me by my first<p></p>
    <p></p>
    name. Most people only address me by my family name."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was pretty surprising to know that someone who seemed as popular as Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't actually have any friends close enough to call her by her first name. Everyone at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school saw her as a flawless angel. Even Mahiru's acquaintances probably maintained<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some degree of formality with her, and nobody had the courage to really get to know<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her. A lot of students only ever addressed her by a nickname that Mahiru herself didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even like.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I guess if you don't have any close friends, that would leave only your parents,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    right?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My parents would never talk to me that way. Absolutely not." Mahiru's reply was cold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Looking her over, Amane saw that Mahiru's face was an expressionless mask. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    resembled a beautiful doll, completely devoid of feeling. That, too, only lasted a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    second, however, and Mahiru's visage changed again when she noticed that Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was looking at her. Her eyebrows lowered, as if she was troubled by something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Anyway, it doesn't happen often," she muttered, before letting out a sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been wondering for a while if Mahiru had a bad relationship with her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    parents. It had been easy enough to imagine that she had problems at home from her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    frosty demeanor whenever he touched on the subject. Plus, she never went out to eat<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with her parents and hated her own birthdays, but Amane never would've thought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's parents were so distant as to not even call the girl by her first name.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thinking back to how Mahiru had quietly said she enjoyed Shihoko's personality,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wondered how the angel must have felt in that moment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru." Rather suddenly, Amane blurted out the word. He'd never called his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    neighbor by her first name before. The girl in question blinked her caramel eyes. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked stunned, and Amane could tell that he'd caught her off guard. The momentary<p></p>
    <p></p>
    surprise had revealed a youthfulness about Mahiru that she normally kept hidden.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's your name. Someone ought to call you by it," Amane reasoned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I suppose you're right," Mahiru answered bluntly. A few moments later, a tiny smile<p></p>
    <p></p>
    appeared. Amane's chest felt fluttery when he spotted it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he heard her small voice pronounce his own first name, the flutter turned to a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    storm. Maybe it was because, until just a moment ago, his mom was the one calling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him by his first name, but when Mahiru called him by his first name face-to-face, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    felt the uneasy, impatient stirring in his chest churn and roar.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Please don't call me that outside, okay?" Mahiru reminded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I already wasn't planning to. That goes for you, too. Don't slip up outside the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Understood. It's our secret, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't bring himself to look directly at Mahiru, as she was still grinning a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    little. Looking away, he responded in agreement and shifted in his seat, turning away<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to escape the angel's smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though Shihoko's Saturday invasion had been a nightmare, nothing much had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    changed aside from how Amane and Mahiru referred to each other.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They hadn't suddenly become any closer. Addressing each other a little more directly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't a big deal. At most, perhaps Mahiru's demeanor had softened a little, but that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Um, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had come over earlier than usual for dinner on Sunday, perhaps feeling a little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    uneasy, because she looked troubled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was glad to let her in, but he was confused by her peculiar attitude. He'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought that maybe using their first names didn't sit right with her after all, but when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the time had come, she'd said his name without hesitation, so there must have been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something else bothering her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For the time being, they sat on the sofa together, and as he waited to see what Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would do, she pulled a handkerchief from her skirt pocket.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane continued to wonder what was up, Mahiru opened the neatly folded<p></p>
    <p></p>
    handkerchief to reveal a tarnished silver key. It must have been the one he'd given her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the day before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm returning your spare key. In the end, I never got the chance to use it, and then I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forgot to give it back. I'm very sorry about that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I see."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, Mahiru hadn't been able to rest until she'd returned the key. Satisfied that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he understood the cause for her strange behavior, Amane stared at the bit of metal<p></p>
    <p></p>
    resting on the handkerchief.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now that he thought about it, Mahiru came over to fix dinner in his apartment almost<p></p>
    <p></p>
    every night. Usually, he met her at the door, but sometimes it took him a while. There'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even been times where Mahiru had been forced to wait because he wasn't home. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    must have been inconvenient for her to have to wait outside for him, especially during<p></p>
    <p></p>
    these colder months. Somewhere, Amane had heard that chilly weather was a girl's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    worst enemy, and now that he thought about it, he wouldn't have been too happy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    waiting in the cold, either, had the situation been reversed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Mahiru was basically coming over every day, he wondered if it wouldn't be easier<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for her to have a key to get in.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's fine; I think you should keep it," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can give it back to me whenever we stop spending time together."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It seemed perfectly reasonable to Amane. Now that Mahiru had the key, she might as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    well keep it—but she didn't seem convinced.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "B-but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, going to the door every time you come over is a hassle."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, so that's what this is about."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I doubt you're going to misuse it or anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that's true, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been sharing meals with Mahiru for more than a month now, and he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    figured that he knew her pretty well. She was sensible, considerate, and kind. He was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certain that she would never hand the key over to anyone else or do anything while<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't around. If there was anyone he could trust, it was Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Besides, you must think it's a pain to have to ring the buzzer and wait out there all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the time," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Even if it is, I feel like you're being a bit careless."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But I'm giving it to you because I trust you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At that, Mahiru's eyes went wide, and she floundered for words. Confusion, along with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something else that Amane didn't really understand, passed over the girl's delicate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    features.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The truth of it was that Amane had only wanted her to have the key to save himself<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some trouble, but if she really hated the idea, he was prepared to back down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As for Mahiru, she looked intently back and forth between Amane and the key for a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    few moments, then finally let out a gentle sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Understood. I'll hold on to it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You know, I'm never sure if something is a big deal to you, or if you even care at all,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane," Mahiru jabbed with a slightly prickly tone. She sounded fed up, and Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couldn't do anything but smile wryly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Suits me well, don't you think?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You shouldn't say things like that about yourself," Mahiru admonished.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's smile grew wider. Mahiru seemed to be growing more comfortable with this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kind of silly back-and-forth. They were now on a first-name basis, of course. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would've been strange if they hadn't built up some kind of rapport. While Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eyes were still full of exasperation, as if to say that Amane was really a hopeless case,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her gaze wasn't cold. In fact, there was a noticeable bit of warmth to it. She understood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Amane was just joking around.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right then, I won't hesitate to use this. I might even do something to your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment without telling you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Like what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Like… a surprise cleaning!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I would be grateful for that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Or how about if your fridge was suddenly packed full of food?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It'd make breakfast easier, and we'd have more options for dinner, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's idea of a prank clearly needed some work. Amane would've been glad to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    suffer under any one of her suggestions. That she couldn't come up with a real threat<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even when she truly tried only reminded Amane of Mahiru's gentle nature. It was quite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    charming and brought a smile to his lips.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you sure you're not making fun of me?" Mahiru looked like she ready to pout,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    which would've been cute in its own right, but Amane didn't want to upset Mahiru any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Suppressing the grin that threatened to break out, Amane said, "Course not."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    11 A Reward for the Angel<p></p>
    "Well, guess that's how it goes," Amane grumbled as he looked the list of names up and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down. The rankings for the previous week's tests were out, so Amane had shown up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to check them like the rest of his class.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Coming in at twenty-first, Amane was situated around his usual score. It was a good<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough ranking but hardly a result that stood out. He hadn't found this exam any more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    challenging than previous ones, though it was still a relief to see he'd done as well as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he'd expected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Surprising no one, Mahiru reigned over all the rest from her typical first-place<p></p>
    <p></p>
    position. She truly was a genius, but Amane knew perfectly well that she didn't attain<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that position without applying herself. Amane had often seen her studying after<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dinner. He wasn't about to argue that Mahiru wasn't smart, but he felt confident that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it was the hard work that put her at the top more than anything else.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shiina is first again, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course she is. The angel's on a whole different level."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Such proclamations caused Amane to make a sour face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What's with that look? Was your rank that bad?" Itsuki came over, puzzled by his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    friend's odd expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Only the top fifty test scores had been posted. As such, Itsuki hadn't come to see his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    own score, but rather, to accompany Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's nothing. I'm twenty-first."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh? Isn't that better than last time?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Only by a little. Gotta consider the margin of error."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whoa, you clever people even speak differently compared with us common folk."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki grinned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah." Amane ignored his friend's sarcasm and turned back to the class<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rankings. He knew Mahiru really gave it her all when it came to studying. She didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like all that effort to show, however, so she worked tirelessly in secret to make her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    success look like it came naturally. Others might've praised her or called her a genius,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but since they didn't know about all the behind-the-scenes struggling, they couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    recognize her actual accomplishments.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That must have been an oppressive way for Mahiru to live.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I should at least do something," Amane whispered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm? What'd you say?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing. Come on, let's go back to class."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "'Kay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? What's this, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had gone to the supermarket and returned with dinner ingredients. When<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she'd started to put them in the refrigerator, a conspicuously unfamiliar white box had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    caught her eye.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm? Ah, it's a cake."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was likely that Mahiru already had an inkling as to the box's contents based on its<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shape, but she'd gone ahead and asked anyway. Amane had gone to a patisserie that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose talked about a lot on social media to buy the cake.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Do you like cake?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not really. I bought it for you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What? Why?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I thought it would be nice as a little celebration, because you were top of our year on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the test. It's to congratulate you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru quickly blinked a few times, unable to process that the cake was for her. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked quite taken aback.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "B-but I get top rank every time, so it's not really something to celebrate," she protested.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you're always working hard, so I thought it might be nice to get a reward for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    once. It's a shortcake. I hope you like that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? I mean… I don't hate it or anything…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Great. Have some after dinner."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While Mahiru still looked a bit troubled, Amane cut the conversation off there. He'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decided that it would be best to act like this was no big deal, since Mahiru always<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed troubled when people treated her like she was special.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was the type of person who would exhaust herself taking care of someone else<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but then neglect herself. Amane had never once seen the girl do anything enjoyable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for her own sake, and whenever anyone praised her or showed appreciation, she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just redouble her efforts and run herself down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Simply put, Mahiru was not good at accepting kindness from others. Amane hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    known her for all that long, but he was sure that much was true. That's why he wanted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to return just a little bit of the kindness she was always showing him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane smiled again as Mahiru got everything ready in the kitchen and began cooking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for that night.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After dinner, Mahiru put the cake on a plate and brought it over to the coffee table with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a nervous expression. Amane couldn't help but chuckle at the sight.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wh-why are you laughing?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing. Don't worry about it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It doesn't seem like nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine—stop worrying."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane found it amusing that Mahiru was acting so stiff, but his laughter clearly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bothered her. He was supposed to be showing her some appreciation, not making fun<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of her, so Amane quickly shut up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru set the cake and the coffee she had brought along with it on the low table, then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sat down on the sofa.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her movements were still slightly stilted, and Amane felt another fit of laughter<p></p>
    <p></p>
    coming on, but Mahiru was sitting next to him now, so he did his best to quash the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    temptation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A shy look in her eyes, Mahiru glanced up at Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Right, so congratulations," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you very much. But…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine; just enjoy it. You worked hard."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's true, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, eat up. Even you should treat yourself to something nice once in a while."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The deed was done, and the cake was already here. Mahiru couldn't object to that. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gave a small nod before picking up the plate of cake and a fork.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Very well, then I will gratefully accept this," she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Please go ahead."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With a nimble wave, Mahiru cut the cake into bite-size pieces with her fork and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cautiously tried some. Amane imagined that girls were naturally very picky about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    their sweets, but since he'd gotten the cake from one of Chitose's favorite shops, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was fairly confident it was a good choice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He knew his hunch was correct when he saw Mahiru's eyes widen slightly when she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    put the cake in her mouth, then the corners of her mouth relax slightly. Usually,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's expressions really didn't change all that much, but recently, she'd become a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bit more animated, or perhaps it was that Amane had gotten better at reading her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    emotions.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The mellow, carefree face that Mahiru let show as she slowly savored her cake was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one she made only while eating.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Hmm? Is something wrong?" She must have noticed Amane staring, and he quickly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, nothing," he answered hastily.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now it was Mahiru's turn to stare at Amane. Suddenly, she snatched up the fork again,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as if an idea had just struck her. She stabbed one bite of cake and held it out toward<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane in a suggestive way. In other words, she was offering to feed him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, um… no, thanks, I didn't really want any," Amane protested.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Really?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…No, well, um… if it's all right, I guess I'll have some, but, uh…" Amane certainly hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expected this development. At a loss, he reflexively agreed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A beautiful girl, hand-feeding him cake. For many adolescent boys, it would be a dream<p></p>
    <p></p>
    come true. Unfortunately, Amane's shyness prevented him from enjoying the situation<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as much as he would've liked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're the one who bought it in the first place, Amane, so you've got to have some,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed entirely unaware of any of the implications behind her gesture. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    maintained an ordinary, clueless expression as she held the cake out toward his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way he could turn her down, so Amane steeled himself and bit down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    An incredibly sugary flavor instantly hit him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…This is crazy sweet," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it is cake."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That wasn't what Amane had really been getting at, but Mahiru remained oblivious.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sweetness spread through Amane's mouth as he chewed, but he was too preoccupied<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with something else to appreciate the flavor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…This really doesn't seem weird to you, does it?" Amane questioned in a low voice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was practically gagging on sweetness and shame, and Mahiru was acting like this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was all quite normal. Amane snatched the fork from Mahiru's hand and held out a bite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of cake to her in the same way she'd done for him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Turnabout is fair play, right?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Um." Mahiru hesitated.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Eat it," Amane insisted, his tone surprisingly forceful. Mahiru looked even more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    confused. Perhaps knowing that she'd started this, she decided to play along and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    timidly took a quick bite. The action reminded Amane of a small bird nipping at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane stared at Mahiru as she chewed, and gradually, a change came over her. At first,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she'd just looked entirely bewildered, but as her mouth moved, a slight redness spread<p></p>
    <p></p>
    across Mahiru's face. By the time she swallowed the cake, there was no hiding her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    obvious embarrassment. Mahiru's usually milk-white cheeks now resembled apples,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and her eyes were shimmering, slightly blurred with tears.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So what do you think?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I-it's d-delicious…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not that. What do you think about being fed?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Surely Mahiru understood now how Amane had felt earlier, and her eyes shifted down<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to look at the floor while she trembled faintly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I feel very much like running away."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I bet you do. That's exactly the sort of thing that might give people the wrong idea,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you know. Save it for your female friends, okay?" Amane turned away sharply to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    emphasize his point.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay," Mahiru replied with a voice that was barely above a whisper.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She'd probably only fed Amane so easily because she trusted him. Mahiru hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    meant any harm by it, of course, but it was still troublesome.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A stubborn sweetness still clung to the inside of Amane's mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Guess someone feeling too safe around you can be its own kind of problem.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In the end, Mahiru curled up into a ball next to Amane, looking slightly embarrassed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as she let a small sigh escape.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    12 Cooking Classes with the Angel<p></p>
    Amane usually bought something to eat for lunch at school, but on days off, that wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    possible. He and Mahiru each had their own errands to take care of, so it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    impossible to eat both lunch and dinner together. Even if it had been doable, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would've felt supremely guilty asking Mahiru to make and eat two meals with him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Usually, Amane only needed to handle his weekend lunches himself, but if he made too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    frequent use of the convenience store, Mahiru would scold him, saying something like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You need to eat a properly balanced diet." With the costs of his dinners piling up,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane also felt awkward about going out to eat for lunch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What to do for his midday meal was quickly becoming an issue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I wonder if I should cook something?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without any errands that would take Amane out of the house, he sat at home by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself. Noon was only an hour away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had likely already gotten started making something for herself, but the same<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could not be said for her hapless neighbor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When it came down to it, Amane could make something if he really had to. It wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like in manga where he'd churn out some censored blob. While it wouldn't look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    particularly fantastic and might not taste spectacular, the food Amane was capable of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    creating was edible. It wasn't exactly cooking, but it was close enough, and it kept him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The problem was that he'd grown accustomed to Mahiru's top-rate meals, so the idea<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of going back to his own dishes was not particularly appealing. Nobody would want to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    go back to such plain fare after sampling such delicious works of art.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …Augh, Mahiru really spoils me.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had become a slave to Mahiru's cooking. He felt ashamed at the thought of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    going out to eat again, but he'd also lost interest in convenience-store meals.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Deciding that he'd been depending on Mahiru too much, Amane concluded this was a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    good time to challenge himself. Even though he'd failed when it came to preparing his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    own meals thus far.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru wouldn't be with him forever, after all. Things between them were nice and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reliable for now, but there were still two years of high school left, so if anything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    happened during that time, this relationship of theirs might come to an abrupt end.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What's more, they would surely go their separate ways when it came time for college.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way things would simply go on like this indefinitely.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I guess I'd better try to put in a little effort now, while I still have her around.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Resolving to do something, even if it was relatively minor, Amane stood up from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sofa and grabbed his wallet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, did you go to the supermarket?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    On his way back from the store, Amane ran into Mahiru in the apartment lobby. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't sure if the coincidental meeting was good or bad. Mahiru looked like she'd also<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just gone out, because she was carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery<p></p>
    <p></p>
    store.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah," Amane admitted. There was no need to hide it, so Amane waved his supermarket<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bags to show her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With a curious expression, Mahiru asked, "Oh, was the shopping from yesterday not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough? Didn't you buy everything on the list?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "N-no, that's not it… It's just… I thought I might try making lunch on my own," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…On your own?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Despite the explanation, Mahiru's eyes seemed full of doubt. It was only natural.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Before becoming dependent on Mahiru's cooking, Amane had survived by buying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    premade meals and convenience-store lunches. It must have been difficult for her to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    believe that he was really going to cook for himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't want to say anything mean," Mahiru continued, "so I'll just tell you it would be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    safer for you to stop now. What if you burn yourself or get a cut?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You know, it's not like I literally can't cook anything at all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Right, it's just that you can't cook anything that tastes good. And that's assuming you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    don't kill yourself in the process."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's thorough dressing down left Amane speechless. She'd said exactly what he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself had been thinking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you say you're going ahead with it, I won't stop you," Mahiru said, "but manage your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expectations, or you'll end up severely disappointed."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Fair enough," Amane conceded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    By "expectations" she must have been referring to her own cooking. Mahiru was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    confident in her abilities, and she was well aware how much Amane enjoyed her food.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's just that, well, you're always talking about nutrition and stuff. There might be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some time in the future when I really have to live on my own, like college. I can't rely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on you forever, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Overdependence on Mahiru only spelled trouble for Amane. After realizing how much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had been spoiling him lately, he felt like he ought to be able to at least manage<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the basics.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes went wide at Amane's words, then she let out a sigh that sounded just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the slightest bit impressed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I think it's a great thing to set your eyes on the future, but if you're going to do that,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shouldn't you have come to me first?" she posed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Rather than making whatever kind of mess you're about to do without my supervision,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it would be much better for me to watch and ensure nothing goes wrong. Amane, are<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you confident that you won't accidentally destroy your kitchen?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…No." Amane sighed. He knew he made a terrible mess of his kitchen whenever he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tried to use it. With no rebuttal, he gave Mahiru a slow nod.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It figures," Mahiru replied stolidly. "That's why it's better for me to be there, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Would that be asking too much?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If I didn't want to do it, I wouldn't have suggested the idea." Her voice had a bit of a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cold edge to it, but since she was agreeing to help him, Amane didn't mind. He bowed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    deeply to express his gratitude.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't need to be so formal," Mahiru said, sounding flustered. Amane smiled, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the two stepped into the elevator, taking it up to their floor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…By the way, do you have an apron?" Mahiru inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No problems on that front. I bought one for cooking class."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And did you use it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There was really no point. All I did was measure ingredients and wash dishes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Figures." Mahiru sighed, as if that was exactly what she had suspected. She accompanied<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane into his apartment. There was actually another apron already there, one that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had left behind. Amane would've felt fairly uncomfortable using that one,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    however.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Donning the apron she kept at Amane's place, Mahiru gathered her hair up into a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ponytail, like she usually did. Eyes narrowed, she watched Amane put on the dark
    <p></p>
    colored apron that he had pulled from the back of a dresser drawer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wow, I've never seen you in that before, Amane. It kind of feels like the apron's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wearing you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, well, excuuuse me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I guess there's nothing we can do about that. So you've already decided what you plan<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to make, right? Since you went and bought the ingredients." Mahiru took a peek at the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shopping bag that Amane had set on a shelf.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane nodded. "Stir-fried vegetables and an omelet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Veggie stir-fry because I've been scolding you to eat more vegetables and an omelet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because you like eggs, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Bull's-eye."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not like it was a difficult guess. What seasonings do you have for the stir-fry?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "This: yakiniku sauce."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh… straight from the bottle, huh? I suppose it has that robust flavor that boys like…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and I guess it is tasty…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's better than me trying to make something from scratch, isn't it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If Amane had no yakiniku sauce on hand, he'd planned on whipping up something that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    used salt, pepper, and soy sauce instead. Truthfully, he was glad that he did have the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    yakiniku sauce. Amane whispered a silent expression of gratitude for his good fortune<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of still having a condiment he could use, then he followed Mahiru's example and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    washed his hands.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While he did that, Mahiru was arranging all the necessary utensils and lining up the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ingredients so they would be easy to use. Truly, the angel's efficiency knew no bounds.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For the veggie stir-fry, you just need to cut the vegetables up and fry them until<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they're cooked evenly through, okay?… Do you know how to cut them?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you making fun of me?" Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was obvious he knew that much. He wasn't very good at it, but he could handle a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    knife.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Under Mahiru's careful supervision, Amane began to finely slice up some cabbage, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he quickly realized how meaningless his earlier words had been after he cut his own<p></p>
    <p></p>
    finger.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    First Amane had been shown how to do it, and then Mahiru left him to try on his own<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while she watched. He'd done fine in the beginning, while Mahiru was helping him get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    used to the task, but as soon as she'd left Amane on his own, he'd slipped up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Owww," he mumbled, looking down at his finger. It was only a small cut, but it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bleeding.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The first thing to do was wash it, but of course getting it wet would sting, too.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I thought something like this might happen. Here, give me that." Mahiru took a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bandage from her apron pocket and skillfully wound it around Amane's hurt finger.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was equal parts grateful and impressed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're very prepared," he complimented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Beginners often hurt themselves."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You have no faith in me, do you?" Despite such an accusation, Amane knew full well<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that there was no reason for her to think he was even slightly capable. He'd hurt<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself almost immediately, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I do recognize that you were trying your best," Mahiru consoled. "That's wonderful."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Gee, thanks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I still would have liked you to ask me ahead of time, though."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You say that, but it would've been awful to make you cook lunch for me, too, especially<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on a weekend."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know you're trying to handle things by yourself, but if you mess up and it becomes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a whole situation that ends with calling me anyway… It would be easier to have just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been here from the start."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fine."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This time, Amane had gotten away with only a light injury, but if some terrible kitchen<p></p>
    <p></p>
    disaster had happened instead, or if he had used some appliance wrong and it stopped<p></p>
    <p></p>
    working, he knew he wouldn't have been able to deal with it on his own. Mahiru was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    absolutely right.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…And please don't ever try to fry anything. You'll start a fire," she added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm nowhere near advanced enough to make fried food," Amane admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't think it's actually quite that difficult… Once again, I'm forced to wonder how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you survived on your own all this time," Mahiru quipped.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry about all this," Amane replied in a sulky voice. "Now you know why I was living<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on convenience-store food."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked at him with concern on her face. Amane wasn't particularly disheartened<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or angry, so she had nothing to worry about, but Mahiru cast her eyes downward,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemingly a little troubled about something anyway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's just—I'm scared of the idea of you making fried foods, Amane, so if you really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want some, please come ask me instead."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right then, tomorrow I want to eat fried mince cutlets." Immediately recovering<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his good humor, Amane was already putting in a request for the next day's dinner.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru gave a small, relieved sigh once she heard that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, but you're eating plenty of cabbage salad on the side. And I'm making miso<p></p>
    <p></p>
    soup with lots of vegetables, got it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah. And… thank you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For everything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru did so much for Amane every day and still found time to worry about him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was truly grateful, even if he sometimes said stupid, hurtful things. He wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sure where he'd be without her. Admitting as much felt a little embarrassing, though.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You help me a lot," he murmured very quietly. He then promptly turned back to the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    vegetables.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Let's eat."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sounds good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Grappling with the vegetables had taken nearly an hour, but it had been worth it. On<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the table was a stir-fry made from clumsily cut greens, a beautifully shaped omelet…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and a pile of scrambled eggs.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Naturally, the beautiful omelet was one Mahiru had made in an attempt to provide<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane with something to use as a reference. While Amane had tried his best to make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a second omelet, he'd ended up with scrambled eggs instead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The failed attempt was set in front of Mahiru so she could evaluate his work. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    picture-perfect example, the platonic ideal of omelets, had been prepared for Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After pressing her hands together in thanks for the food, Mahiru grabbed a piece of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the tattered eggs with her chopsticks to check the taste.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's flavorless scrambled eggs, all right. Didn't you add any salt or pepper?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I forgot. Plus, I was supposed to be making an omelet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You scrambled it up too much. What were you thinking, mixing it with the chopsticks<p></p>
    <p></p>
    until it fell apart? I warned you about that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had forgotten to add the seasonings because he'd mixed up his egg while<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was making her omelet. Otherwise, he'd been under careful supervision<p></p>
    <p></p>
    throughout the whole process. The lacking flavor and shape of his eggs was clearly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's own fault.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    On the other hand, Mahiru's dish was soft, fluffy, and unspeakably delicious. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    difference between them was night and day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I think, for you, it was a really good attempt. The most important thing is that you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tried. Still, I'm worried that if I let you try it on your own, the cleanup afterward will<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be awful, so I'd like you to take it slow, okay?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm going to become totally reliant on you," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's a little late for that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ugh…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Just joking. Well, not really, but I like that you appreciate my cooking, and I don't hate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    teaching you to cook, either, so… really, you don't have to worry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thanks again—for everything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was really thanks to Mahiru's kindness that Amane was able to live as well as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was. He owed her quite a bit, but he knew that Mahiru would hate it if he groveled too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much, so he held his head high.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Curiously, Mahiru was wearing a slightly lonesome expression as she said, "If you do<p></p>
    <p></p>
    learn how to cook, Amane, I guess I'll be relieved of my duties."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was certainly true that when Amane learned to fix his own meals, there would be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    no need for Mahiru to do it for him anymore, but Amane shook his head.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, that's… I mean… Your cooking is the best, Mahiru, so please… I want to keep<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eating it for as long as I can. Though, I guess that's kinda shameless of me to ask."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane would never have denied it was selfish of him to want Mahiru to continue<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooking for him, but at the same time, her food was obviously leagues better than his,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and he couldn't turn it away. The addiction had long since set in, and Amane was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    terrified of being cut off.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes widened at the humble plea, and she smiled slightly. The vague tinge of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    loneliness vanished in an instant.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ha-ha. You really are hopeless, aren't you? Well, I don't intend to stop, so you can<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relax."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thanks," Amane said, feeling relieved that the shade of anxiety he'd seen on her face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was gone, replaced with a faint smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How about I get you to help me out sometimes? Peeling vegetables, measuring<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ingredients, things like that," Mahiru proposed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Like a kid helping in the kitchen."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, that's where you need to start, you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Amane's skill level truly was on par with a child's, there was really nothing he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could say back. Mahiru looked amused.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    13 Christmas with Everyone<p></p>
    "Hey, Amane, can we have a Christmas party at your place?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nope."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The proposal had been immediately shot down, and Chitose puffed out her cheeks to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    make her disappointment obvious.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Christmas Eve was fast approaching, but since Amane lived separately from his family<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and was a loner by nature, the holiday didn't hold any real significance. Still, Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and Itsuki seemed keen on spending it with him and had come to ask him about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    holding a little celebration.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose had gone out of her way to barge into Amane and Itsuki's classroom at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lunchtime with the idea, and now she had her cheeks puffed out because of Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    near-instant refusal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, Amane," Itsuki angled. "You're alone anyway… ah, unless maybe there's a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girlfriend in the picture?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, there isn't."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well then, it's fine!" Chitose interjected. "Or could it be that you secretly hate us?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if Amane hates us, then I guess we don't need him, either," Itsuki added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In their own way, his friends were probably expressing their concern for him. There<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was also the possibility that they were hunting for a place where they could relax and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    flirt. Amane felt bad about refusing them, even when they made such exaggeratedly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    disappointed faces at him. He didn't actually hate them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was not to say Amane had no concerns, however. First was the thought of how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the two of them would act in a private setting. Amane could feel the embarrassment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    washing over him at the mere thought of Itsuki and Chitose's shameless intimacy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Then there was the fact that he would have to explain things to Mahiru. She would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have to steer clear until Amane's friends left, and he would have to be very careful<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about covering up any evidence of her frequent visits.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fine. I get it, I get it. The twenty-fourth, right? I have a condition, though: You have to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    set me free before nightfall and go somewhere else together to get all your flirting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    done. I'll remind you that excessive physical contact is prohibited in my apartment."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With Amane's concession to the couple's demands, Chitose's face lit up with a smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Guess there's nothing we can do about that rule. I'm sure we can work something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out," she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Who do you think you are to say such entitled things?" Amane quickly grabbed one<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of Chitose's cheeks and pinched.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Owwsh!" she slurred. "Itsukiii, Amane's buwwyying me!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, Amane, don't be mean to Chi! I'm the only one who's allowed to pinch her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cheeks," Itsuki said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fine, fine; pinch her real good for me, then," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Leave it to me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't you dare!" Chitose cried.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane entrusted Itsuki to carry out the sentence, but as one might've expected, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and Chitose turned it into just another excuse to flirt. Within moments, the two of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    them started messing around, playfully pinching each other's faces.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now Chitose actually looked happy to be pinched.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane shrugged. "…Can I go?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This was Amane's classroom, but he wanted to get some distance from the
    <p></p>
    lovey-dovey couple before they got any more insufferable.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way! We've got to make proper plans. We need to arrange for food and a cake!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not making anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way Amane could fix a Christmas meal. Mahiru could handle it, no<p></p>
    <p></p>
    problem, but there was absolutely no way he could get her help this time. That's why<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane quickly brushed off the idea, insisting that it would be impossible for him to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cook. Chitose didn't seem convinced, however, and was staring at him strangely.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I was just thinking you look awfully healthy for someone who can't cook," Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So? What's the problem?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you see, Chi, Amane's got his own reasons for that," Itsuki commented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, well, don't you want to know about them, too, Itsuki?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'll get him to spill later."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not telling you a thing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane glared at Itsuki as if to tell him not to make promises he couldn't keep, and he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    laughed out loud, in a forced way. Itsuki knew when to let things go, but he had a bad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    habit of dredging up old stuff at rather inopportune times.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You guys are a real handful…," Amane muttered. "Well, for dinner, can't we get takeaway<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or something? We'll have to order the cake if we want one." Attempting to move away<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from his own affairs that the couple seemed so eager to pry into, he made a pragmatic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    proposal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way he could make a cake or prepare a meal on his own, so arranging<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for ready-made food seemed to be the way to go.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, all right then, let's have pizza! I'll book a cake from my usual place; they're still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    taking orders!" Chitose declared.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't want chicken?" asked her boyfriend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You like pizza better, too, don't you, Itsuki?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "True, true. That's my Chi; you know me best."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Eh-heh-heh…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While the two lovebirds had decided on what to get without discussing it at all with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane, he was fine with pizza. Something like that made it feel more like a party<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anyway. Given the way things were going, they would probably pick up some takeaway<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pizzas from the shop that Amane and Itsuki often visited.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The moment Amane heard the word pizza, he thought of Mahiru—and when she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nibbled her pizza like a small animal. Amane had found it strangely charming, probably<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because he usually saw her eating so elegantly. Come to think of it, he'd gotten Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to eat cake the other day, too. Amane's cheeks glowed warmly as he remembered that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I won't do anything like that again, Amane vowed to himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It'd been so embarrassing to feed each other; there was no way Amane could endure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a repeat of that. Mahiru and Amane weren't some affectionate couple like Itsuki and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose, so the opportunity should never come up again anyway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Hey, Amane, what's up?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, no, nothing. All right, we'll leave the cake order up to you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had drifted back into some embarrassing memories for a moment, and Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had started staring at him with a concerned expression, puzzled. Panicking, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chased the flustering thoughts from his head and did his best to be casual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right! Let's get our pizza order in, too!" he said, a bit more worked up than usual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With Chitose's excitable voice still ringing in his ears, Amane returned home and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decided to ask Mahiru about her Christmas plans.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Christmas plans? I don't really have any," Mahiru replied quickly from her place on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the sofa. Amane had posed the question after finishing the dishes and joining her in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the living room. He'd been confident Mahiru would be going to a girls' party, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apparently, she didn't have anything lined up. Maybe Amane's surprise showed,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because Mahiru made an annoyed face at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Basically, all the girls I know and most of my female classmates have boyfriends to go<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out with. And I always turn down all the boys who invite me out, so my schedule is<p></p>
    <p></p>
    totally open," she explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Breaking all the hearts, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whenever she was out in public, Mahiru kept her guard up, and any hopeful suitors<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were sure to end up drowning in their own tears when faced with the angel's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    impregnable defenses.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Still, Amane had to respect anyone who had the guts to ask Mahiru out. No one would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be able to do such a thing without a huge amount of self-confidence, and Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    admired those optimistic types.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I wonder why boys want to spend Christmas with me so badly anyway?" Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wondered aloud.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "They're probably hoping to get to know you better," Amane explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What for?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, because they want to date you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And why would they want to date me?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Probably to do all the sorts of… things that dating people do."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How obscene."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane offered a silent prayer for all the guys who'd just been ruthlessly discarded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I don't think every one of them is like that, so don't be too distrustful. I'm sure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you understand that you're the sort of girl who draws all their eyes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're right. It's unlikely that all of them are harboring lewd thoughts. After all, you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    aren't like that, are you, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Have I ever treated you that way?" Amane had certainly thought Mahiru looked cute,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or that he wanted to rub her head, but he'd never gone so far as to fantasize about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    being intimate with her. If such things ever did cross his mind, Amane was sure that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru would likely notice and pull away from him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was only because Mahiru saw Amane as a harmless puppy that he could sit there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    next to her. Baring so much as a single fang could be enough to send her running away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The needs of Amane's stomach ranked higher in his mind than other appetites, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had no intention of jeopardizing his relationship with Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose you're right. You never seemed to have any interest in me from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    beginning, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm-hmm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's why I trust you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, thanks for that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As a guy, Amane wasn't sure how he felt about Mahiru's reasons for trusting him, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for the time being, he decided he was okay with being the "safe guy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…So, Amane, did you have something in mind when you asked me about my Christmas<p></p>
    <p></p>
    plans?" Mahiru inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm? Oh, on the afternoon of the twenty-fourth, Itsuki and Chitose are coming over,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so I thought I would let you know that, uh, our usual dinner might have to start late."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Having returned to the original topic of conversation, Amane carefully explained the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    situation while Mahiru nodded along.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I understand. Please call me once your Christmas party is over, and I'll make dinner<p></p>
    <p></p>
    then. I'll try to take care of the prep work ahead of time," Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure; sorry about all that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine. Have fun."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You won't be lonely?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm used to spending Christmas alone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's casual attitude about spending the holiday alone struck Amane as rather<p></p>
    <p></p>
    depressing. Perhaps thoughts of Christmas had reminded Mahiru of her parents,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because a small, self-deprecating laugh slipped out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Ah, um, this is really presumptuous of me to say, but… even if I can't do Christmas<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Eve, how about we spend Christmas Day together?" Amane felt extremely awkward<p></p>
    <p></p>
    making this sort of suggestion. He didn't have any particular ulterior motive, but two<p></p>
    <p></p>
    people getting together on the holiday usually did carry a certain implication.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There's no special meaning to this, Amane told himself. It was just that he hated when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked so lonely; that was all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Surprised, Mahiru blinked quickly at the suggestion. "Together? Doing what?" she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? Ah, well, I didn't really have anything in mind. Sorry." Now that it was obvious<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he didn't have a plan, Amane figured he should drop the issue. There was also the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    consideration that going out together meant there was a risk of being spotted by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone from school. That would be a huge problem for Amane and Mahiru both.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The best option would be spending time at home, but there was probably nothing in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's apartment that would interest Mahiru. It would likely boil down to just sitting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    next to each other, doing nothing, which would probably be incredibly awkward.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If that's all Amane could offer, he suspected it was probably better to just spend the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    day apart. As he prepared to withdraw his proposal, he noticed that Mahiru was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    staring at him quietly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Okay. I'd like to try that," It was unexpected, but Mahiru actually seemed interested.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her slim finger was pointing at the television. To be more precise, she was pointing at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the game console housed inside the TV stand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recently, Mahiru had been visiting in the evenings, so Amane hadn't booted up the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    system much, but it seemed like Mahiru was curious about it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I've never used one of those things…," she confessed in a small voice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't have any concrete reason to refuse Mahiru if she wanted to try playing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    games, but the thought of a guy and girl who weren't dating or anything spending<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Christmas day together playing video games was somewhat surreal. Even if he wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hoping for anything romantic, it was only natural that the idea gave rise to a confusing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mix of emotions.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, well, that'd be fine, but… is that okay? To spend the day gaming?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is there anything wrong with that?" Mahiru replied with her own question.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I guess not, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, then let's go with that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "S-sure."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Great, I guess that's what we're doing…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since it was what Mahiru wanted, Amane resolved himself to do everything he could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to make sure it happened. He wanted to at least give her this modest bit of enjoyment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was always taking care of him, and she hardly ever asked for anything, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would let her play anything she wanted, as long as he had it in his collection. It wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like he had any plans on Christmas Day anyway, so this was a small price indeed for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's fantastic cooking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, we can have a laid-back day that doesn't have anything to do with Christmas<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or whatever," Amane declared.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Then it's decided," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane found it difficult to look directly at Mahiru's smiling face, so instead he nodded<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and turned away while doing his best to look casual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Merry Christmas!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Christmas Eve arrived before too long.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    School had already let out for winter break, and everyone was probably spending the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    day enjoying themselves. Itsuki and Chitose had shown up at Amane's apartment,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    party supplies in hand, at around one in the afternoon.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    On the table, the pizza and juice they had ordered for delivery were already laid out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The three had actually planned to meet up a bit earlier, but the Christmas crowds had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slowed everything down and put them all behind schedule. Thankfully, it was only an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hour past noon, and Amane hadn't been waiting too long, so no one seemed all that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bothered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah, Merry Christmas," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, you don't sound very excited! Try again," Chitose instructed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Merry Christmas!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're saying the words just fine, but you're not really in the spirit, are you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't like to be compared to Chitose, who was very excitable by nature.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Realizing that she was even more worked up than usual, Itsuki did his best to placate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose. He flashed a flippant, yet still-warm smile at his girlfriend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, we don't need to worry about that. Let's get to the eating part and the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    having-a-good-time part and then the falling-asleep part," said Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can't sleep here, idiot," Amane snapped.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm just kidding, geez. Besides, if I am gonna sleep, I'm going to Chi's place."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You'll have to do that when her parents aren't around."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, Amaneee! What kind of perverted things are you thinking?!" Chi cried. She was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grinning, but Amane didn't respond. Instead, he made for the kitchen to grab some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cups and utensils. Pouting, Chitose looked briefly disappointed at this lack of reaction<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but then quickly followed after him, shouting that she would help.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The kitchen was, naturally, neat and tidy, with everything in order. Mahiru had made<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it her territory as of late, so all the various tools and seasonings were lined up for easy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    access.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whoa, this is way cleaner than I expected," Chitose commented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks a lot," Amane responded idly. He took small plates for individual portions and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some cups out of a kitchen cupboard. When he tried to hand half to Chitose, he found<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her staring fixedly at the cupboard.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What is it?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing!" she answered hurriedly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt something devious behind Chitose's sly smile, and a shiver shot down his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    back. The best course of action for the time being was to ignore her entirely, however,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so Amane did his best to act like nothing was wrong. He had a terrible feeling Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was brewing up some elaborate misconception, but since she hadn't said anything,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't sure what it could be.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Grimacing, Amane and Chitose returned to the living room where Itsuki was waiting.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was becoming abundantly clear that Chitose was in an even better mood than when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she'd first arrived.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Seriously, though, your apartment is super clean. It's so big and luxurious," Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    muttered. The three friends had mostly finished eating. They'd been listening to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Christmas music through the speakers in the living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was little Amane could say in response to Chitose's comment. He was living in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a nice apartment because his parents were paying for it, and the place was only this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clean because Mahiru had helped him keep it that way. After considering that, all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could say was "Yeah, thanks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's definitely impressive how much better the place looks now that it's clean…," Itsuki<p></p>
    <p></p>
    remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up…," Amane shot back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yep, yep, I smell a girl!" Chitose added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How did you make that jump?" Amane had no idea how Chitose made the connection<p></p>
    <p></p>
    between his clean apartment and a feminine presence.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm? Call it a woman's intuition. The way everything's arranged is a little off for you,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    personality-wise. There's something about the way the books are lined up and how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the cords are all gathered to keep them from getting tangled or torn. Plus, there are all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sorts of cooking implements in the kitchen that seem like they really don't belong to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…They're my mom's," Amane lied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Preemptively, Amane had shoved all of Mahiru's things into the back of a cabinet, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose must have caught sight of them when Amane had been getting the plates.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's tableware alone hadn't been enough, so Mahiru had brought a few things<p></p>
    <p></p>
    over from her place, but Amane hadn't expected Chitose to notice. For better or worse,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was not the kind of person who usually paid attention to such details.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it's not like we care that much, right, Itsuki?" Amane's reply had been suspiciously<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slow. Sensing a deeper meaning in that, Chitose leaned over to Itsuki, grinning.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Casually, and without a hint of hesitation, Itsuki reached over and rested his hand<p></p>
    <p></p>
    between Chitose's knees as he embraced her. It was getting extremely difficult to look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    directly at the couple.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, why don't you get a room, you two?!" Amane shouted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, you jealous, Amane?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Psh, yeah right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Rather than any sort of envy, Amane just wanted them out of his sight. He wished they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would stop, but this sort of behavior was business as usual for the couple. Scolding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    them for it was a waste of energy at this point.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Looking very satisfied with herself as she clung to Itsuki, Chitose leaned against his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chest and looked up at Itsuki's face. "…I bet everyone's flirting at their own parties<p></p>
    <p></p>
    right about now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, don't forget you've got a guy right here crying bitter tears of loneliness," said<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There's no way everyone is acting like these two.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There had to be some people who were spending the holiday with family—and others<p></p>
    <p></p>
    who were spending it with friends. Surely there were even some spending the holiday<p></p>
    <p></p>
    completely alone. Amane felt like Chitose ought to choose her words more carefully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Not everyone was lucky enough to spend Christmas with other people.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do boys really want sweethearts that badly?" Chitose asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't think they do," Amane answered flatly. "I certainly don't."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, but…," Itsuki interjected, "you're an outlier."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, everyone gets restless right before Christmas, you know," Chitose continued.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Especially single guys. The other day, I asked the angel about her Christmas plans and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    found out she'd ruthlessly rejected just about every boy in school. She left 'em all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brokenhearted because she supposedly already made plans with someone else."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh," Itsuki said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had a feeling that someone was him. The idea that he was little more than a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    diplomatic excuse to turn down other dates wasn't a pleasant one, but he knew that it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pained Mahiru to have to refuse anyone. If having plans with Amane helped ease<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's conscience, then he supposed he couldn't object. After all, she wasn't giving<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his name out, so there shouldn't be any trouble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All those poor boys looked so crushed. It was rude, but I laughed," Chitose recalled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You shouldn't laugh!" Itsuki scolded playfully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, using a holiday as an excuse to try to score a date with a girl you barely know<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is total crap, isn't it? They're already off to a late start 'cause they haven't built any kind<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of relationship, so they try to take a convenient little shortcut to get to where they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really want to be. Plus, I bet those guys are the kind who'd say they were taking her to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a party with a lot of people but then create some excuse to be alone with her. It's a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    scary thing, for a girl."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose went on to add that the angel was certainly not the type to go along with those<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kinds of games anyway, then stuck out her tongue and clung to Itsuki even more, as if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she'd touched on an unpleasant memory. Trendy and beautiful, Chitose had a different<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look than Mahiru. It wouldn't have been surprising to learn that she'd had some bad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    experiences with guys in the past. Amane felt a little sorry for her. Popular girls<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certainly had it rough.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It must be hard on Shiina, dealing with all those propositions," Amane said suddenly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're really not interested in the angel, are you, Amane?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not really," Amane replied flatly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You already have that angelic next-door neighbor of yours, huh?" Chitose needled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't think I won't kick you out of my apartment…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, don't! I'm sooo scaaared!" Chitose whined, clinging to Itsuki as she playfully<p></p>
    <p></p>
    glared at Amane. "So you're not denying that your neighbor has been taking care of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's words stuck in his throat, and Chitose grinned with smug satisfaction, though<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her expression quickly changed when she saw his face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't glare at me like that! Sorry, geez…" Chitose apologized in a tone that held very<p></p>
    <p></p>
    little remorse. When Amane narrowed his eyes at her a second time, she gave a cutesy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shriek and clung to Itsuki again. Then she happened to look through the window<p></p>
    <p></p>
    behind her boyfriend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something outside was surprising enough for her to stare, so Amane also followed her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gaze and looked at the window, wondering what was going on. Little white flecks were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wafting down from the blue sky.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Ah, Itsuki, look! Snow!" Chitose cried.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whoa, a white Christmas!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Snow wasn't that unusual at the end of December, but it was rare to see any on such a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clear day, and it seemed to delight the lovebirds.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was still daytime, and the temperature was only going to drop as the sun began to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    set. Christmas Eve was likely to be blanketed in snow this year. Couples all over town<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were likely rejoicing, and the couple in Amane's apartment had already stepped out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    onto his balcony for a better view.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm sure you're going to be making out over there for a while, so I'll fix you some warm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    drinks," Amane shouted as he watched Itsuki and Chitose head outside. As Amane was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    standing up, a hysterical shriek suddenly caught his ear.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?! Wh-why are you here?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The last voice in the bunch was one Amane had only become accustomed to hearing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relatively recently. It rang clear and sweet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt his stomach sink.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Aware that Itsuki and Chitose were huddling together on his veranda, Amane dashed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out in a panic and saw that Mahiru had also come out onto her own balcony to look at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the snow. In doing so, she had been spotted by Amane's friends the moment she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    leaned over the railing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane looked at Mahiru, who was now sitting beside him, and sighed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Faced with the terrible disaster of everyone encountering each other on the balconies,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been left with no other option but to invite Mahiru into his apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No matter what Amane tried now, his two friends would definitely be suspicious. At<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this point, telling them the whole truth was probably the only way to avoid unnecessary<p></p>
    <p></p>
    speculations and misunderstandings. Things were bound to get worse if he couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    keep Itsuki and Chitose quiet about this, too.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Um, I really am sorry," Mahiru said gently.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You didn't do anything wrong."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was a white Christmas and also the first snow of the year. Of course Mahiru had gone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to her veranda to take a look. No one could've blamed her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If Amane had heard the sound of her opening her glass door, he might have been able<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to do something, but there'd been music playing in the apartment, so he hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    noticed. Mahiru had likely been trying to stay quiet anyway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose was staring at Amane and Mahiru as they reflected on their carelessness, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her eyes sparkled as she leaned in close. "So Amane's next-door neighbor was the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    angel all along?!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um, please don't call me that…" True to form, Mahiru hated being called an angel to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her face and politely objected to the nickname, but Chitose was grinning from ear to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ear, and it wasn't clear whether she was listening.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki, meanwhile, scratched his cheek and looked back and forth between Amane and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, eyebrows raised. "Wow. So… just to recap, Shiina lives next door, and she's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been making you meals this whole time. Is that about right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yeah," Amane admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "W-well… um, I had a favor to repay, and I could tell by looking at him that Fujimiya<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was not eating well, and that bothered me, so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The two tried their best to explain how they first met and why they'd continued seeing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    each other. Itsuki acted like he understood but still wore an expression like he didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quite comprehend it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought that if he were in Itsuki's position, he probably wouldn't be able to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grasp the whole story, either. Who would believe that an incredible girl like Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would so casually decide to start caring for an unremarkable slob like Amane?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm, so I think I understand the situation, but what's really strange about all this is<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the idea that you don't have any ulterior motives toward Amane, Shiina. Like, you're<p></p>
    <p></p>
    basically acting as if you're his part-time wife," said Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Guh!" Amane sputtered in surprise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Wife?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wouldn't have chosen such a word, but he had to admit that their current<p></p>
    <p></p>
    interactions did somewhat resemble that sort of relationship. Mahiru made him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dinner every night and had even treated him to lunch on a recent weekend. On top of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that, she sometimes helped him with cleaning. On the surface, it wasn't too far off from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stereotypical married life. The important distinction was that neither Amane nor<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru harbored any romantic feelings for the other.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes had also widened slightly at Itsuki's assessment, but she very quickly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    recovered from the shock, and Amane could see her slipping into her cordial public<p></p>
    <p></p>
    persona. "I can assure you that I have no such intentions whatsoever."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane realized that she was handling Itsuki and Chitose the same way she handled<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everyone else at school. Suddenly, he felt extremely embarrassed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's perfectly innocent," Amane added. "Shiina is just helping me out, okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you say so, Amane. It's just… What a strange pairing. It's really a bit hard to swallow<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that such an incredible girl is cooking for you… Hey, that stuffed animal you bought,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was that also for her?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Maybe," Amane conceded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whaaa—?!" Chitose broke into a shout.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, be quiet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I haven't said anything yet, though?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your face is loud enough."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Rude!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose's smirk was irritating. She looked incredibly pleased with herself for having<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "solved" this mystery. Up to this point, the conversation had proceeded without much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    teasing, and Amane was grateful for that. He certainly didn't need any unnecessary<p></p>
    <p></p>
    prodding right now, and Mahiru likely wouldn't be thrilled by the idea, either. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had been hoping that Chitose would keep her mouth shut.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on now; calm down, both of you." Itsuki put a stop to things before they really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    got out of hand. He'd picked up on the change in Amane's demeanor and was not the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    type to poke fun at his friend like Chitose would. Itsuki was the kind of guy who was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sensitive to how people felt. Of course, Amane wished he'd stopped before prying in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the first place, but that ship had sailed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After scolding Amane and Chitose, Itsuki turned back to Mahiru, who was sitting stiffly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the sidelines, and bowed his head. "…Um, Shiina, thank you for taking care of our<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Since when did I become your kid?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I should be thanking you, for being such dear friends to Fujimiya," Mahiru answered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gracefully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "C'mon, not you, too! You're making me sound like a worthless jerk."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You kinda are, though," Itsuki remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, screw you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd heard Itsuki say things like that to him before, but Amane was hardly in the mood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    right now. Mahiru could have joined in the banter, but she wisely kept silent and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smiled, content to watch the exchange between the two boys. She wasn't being quite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as expressive as she was when she was alone with Amane, but that smile lifted the veil<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on her usual act just a little bit. Perhaps noticing, Itsuki looked befuddled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane made a crack about Itsuki checking her out despite his being taken, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose started pouting and laid into Amane even harder. It was kind of funny, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had her head tilted in bemusement, so Amane downplayed his enjoyment and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    assumed a more relaxed pose.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…All right, look. We don't have a mushy-sweet relationship like you guys do, but I still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    need you both to understand that this could get really hairy if word got out," said<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Got it; say nothing to nobody." Evidently picking up on his friend's attempts to point<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out the potential danger, Itsuki quickly nodded in understanding, much to Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    surprise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You too, Chitose," Amane added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not that much of a chatterbox, you know. Besides, no one would believe that such<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a cute girl is making dinner and stuff for you of all people."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, excuse me for being so undeserving…," Amane muttered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Geez, I didn't mean it like that!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was well aware that what Chitose was saying was true. It was difficult to accept<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that the star of the school was taking care of an ordinary schlub like him. If anyone did<p></p>
    <p></p>
    believe the story, they'd probably curse Amane's very name for being so undeserving<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of Mahiru's angelic attention. Amane was particularly imaginative when it came to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    visualizing that last part, which was why he really didn't want the truth about their<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relationship getting out. He could do without all the trouble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose laughed at Amane's sudden humility. Then her gaze shifted to Mahiru, as if her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eye had been drawn to something. Chitose let out a heavy sigh as she stared longingly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at the other girl. Mahiru quickly turned uncomfortable, like she wasn't sure what to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    do.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um, what is it?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It just struck me all over again. Shiina, you're ridiculously cute, aren't you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? Thank you very much…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Having praised Mahiru right to her face, Chitose continued to stare, scrutinizing every<p></p>
    <p></p>
    last bit of her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "This is my first time seeing you so close-up, but sure enough, you really are as beautiful<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as an angel, aren't you? Your face has a nice shape, and your skin is lovely and creamy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Plus, your eyelashes are long, your hair is smooth, and you're slim but still curvy!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, um…?" Mahiru managed, flustered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sighed deeply. He couldn't deal with Chitose when she got like this. While the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girl definitely had her merits, there sure were some things he couldn't stand about her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He couldn't put up with her high-energy personality or the fact that she was always<p></p>
    <p></p>
    butting into other people's business.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had a particular appreciation for how difficult she could be because he had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone similar in his family. It was all the ways in which Chitose reminded him of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his mother that really drove him crazy. Undeniably, Chitose resembled Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mother in taste and disposition; she was obsessed with cute things.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wow, seriously, looking closely, you're an incredible beauty—and so cute! Hey, hey,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    can I touch your hair? I mean, do you have a secret to getting your hair so smooth and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shiny? What shampoo and conditioner do you use?" Chitose pressed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wait, ah, um… so sudden…," Mahiru stammered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your skin's so soft, too. What kind of regimen do you follow to keep it like this?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose, who seemed caught between a desire to share beauty secrets and a want to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    poke and prod at the beautiful girl, stretched out a hand toward Mahiru as she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bombarded her with questions.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt sorry for Mahiru, who, despite her discomfort, was powerless against the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    onslaught. Cursing under his breath, Amane lightly bonked Chitose on the head. It was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a just a tap, since the goal was simply to get Chitose to cool her heels, but she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apparently been caught by surprise as she cried "Oww!" and drew her hand back away<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from Mahiru. As for Mahiru, she seemed relieved by Amane's intercession. He'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forgotten about it because she was conducting herself with her usual angelic poise,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but Mahiru was extremely wary around people she wasn't used to. Chitose was a girl,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so Mahiru wasn't as wary as she had been with Amane, but her fear of strangers was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    still quite clear.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can't believe you did that!" Chitose whined.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She's shy, and you've only just met her, so stop trying to touch her," Amane chided.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can touch her once we get to know each other?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You'll need to ask Shiina about that. Be respectful."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had obviously been getting ready to make a run for it. It was a good thing he'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stepped in. Even Chitose seemed to understand why she should stop when she saw<p></p>
    <p></p>
    how clearly shaken Mahiru was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm sorry; I got too excited and almost did something without asking," Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apologized.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, mm-hmm…" Mahiru still seemed upset by the close call, and she looked at Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as if she didn't know what to do, her eyes pleading for help.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, Shiina, Chitose can be sorta a handful, but she's not a bad person… I think," Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is that supposed to be a compliment?" the excitable girl snapped.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look at the way you were acting. Can you really argue?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nope!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose, having just openly disavowed her own actions, stared at Mahiru for a moment,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    then once again extended a hand toward her, wearing a very serious expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "In that case, it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance!" This time, however, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    presented Mahiru with an open hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? Y-yeah, nice to meet you…" Mahiru hesitantly accepted the handshake.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once Chitose took a liking to someone, Amane knew she was determined to be their<p></p>
    <p></p>
    friend, whether they wanted it or not. Something told Amane that Mahiru would be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    swayed by Chitose's persistence. Really, as long as she didn't do anything too weird in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her pursuit of Mahiru's friendship, Amane didn't mind. An ordinary, low-key<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relationship was best.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "First impressions are so important for becoming good friends, you know! You<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably already know who I am, and I'm sure you've heard my name from Amane,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but I'm Chitose Shirakawa. I'm Itsuki's girlfriend. I guess you could call him… Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    best friend?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh my, I'm blushing! A best friend, wow," Itsuki ribbed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't act so flattered, Itsuki; it's weird," Amane shot back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There you go again… Hey, Amane, they've got a name for people like you, y'know…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sweet and sour!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'll seriously kick you out."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Forcing us outside in the snow? Oh, how cruel!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't try to wheedle your way out of this one."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki cackled with laughter, and Amane looked even more annoyed. Mahiru's eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    went wide as she watched their exchange.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, we always act like this," Itsuki informed her as he smiled cheerfully. "So anyway,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'm Itsuki Akazawa. I'm best friends with that knucklehead over there. If Amane ever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    does anything stupid or weird, you can come talk to me any time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is that any way to talk about your best friend?" Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, Fujimiya doesn't seem to have any interest in me," Mahiru said. "He may not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have any basic life skills, but he's an otherwise ordinary guy, so I'm not expecting any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    trouble."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks, I guess… but you could have left out the part about me being incompetent."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could have gone without that specific remark, but he was happy to hear that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru did indeed see him as a person she could trust.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki drew close and whispered in Amane's ear, "You've gotten awfully close to Shiina<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for somebody who says he's not interested."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane would be lying if he said he wasn't interested at all, but he really wasn't actively<p></p>
    <p></p>
    trying to steer their relationship in that direction. He was certain that Mahiru just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wanted a close friend, not a romantic partner. The two of them were happy spending<p></p>
    <p></p>
    their time together as they had been.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Glancing at Mahiru, Amane saw that she'd gotten all flustered again. Chitose had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    begun another round of interrogation, having decided her conversation with Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was over.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, Mahiru didn't seem to hate the attention, and Amane hoped that maybe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    when she got more comfortable, she might relax a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As bewildered as she was, Mahiru responded to the barrage of questions with a small<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smile. It came as no small relief for Amane that the two girls were getting acquainted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    without any issue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm really sorry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After night had fallen, and Itsuki and Chitose had gone home, Amane apologized to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, who looked more than a little worn-out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was obvious that Mahiru had been left exhausted and confused after dealing with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    two strangers who'd just discovered their secret. This conversation felt like an exact<p></p>
    <p></p>
    repeat of the one they'd had after Shihoko's surprise visit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, my own carelessness was what caused it, after all," Mahiru refuted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "They sure did make a fuss."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "They're… lively people."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can be honest; they're both loudmouths."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "They were a little assertive, but they're interesting."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "'A little' is being very generous… Well, as long as you didn't mind, I guess it's all good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was convinced that his friends' behavior had crossed the line for Mahiru, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the mild-mannered girl was taking it all in stride. He was glad that she hadn't found<p></p>
    <p></p>
    them too troublesome, but he wasn't sure whether it was a good thing that she and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose were apparently becoming friends.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose is a totally different type of girl from Mahiru. Very… energetic? Which is nice, I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    suppose. He trusted Chitose not to do anything malicious, but he would need to keep<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an eye on her to be certain she gave Mahiru enough space.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't have any people like that in my life, so it was kind of fun."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Right, I imagine you don't really have anyone like Chitose in your circle… If she gets<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too persistent, you can just slap her, okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I w-would never resort to violence, so I'll do my best to keep her in check with my<p></p>
    <p></p>
    words."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose had an excess of energy and often let her enthusiasm get the better of her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was sure that eventually his advice would be warranted. As he fixed in his mind<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an oath to caution Chitose directly the next time he saw her, Amane turned toward the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    window and watched the snow fluttering down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If it weren't for this weather, we never would've been discovered, he thought. Snowflakes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were supposed to carry good tidings for lovers everywhere, however, so Amane didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    think it right to curse them for his troubles.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru also seemed to enjoy watching the snow because, once she realized what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was looking at, she stared out the window in the exact same way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was winter, so the sun had set early. The sky was dark, and the snow was pale, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he could just barely see the flakes falling in the light coming from the surrounding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment buildings.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A white Christmas, huh?" Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I guess so," Amane answered. "Though, that sappy stuff doesn't have much to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    do with us."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's still very pretty. Isn't that enough?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Spending a romantic white Christmas together didn't mean anything to them, since<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they weren't a couple, but… Mahiru seemed to be enjoying the sight anyway, so the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    snow couldn't be all bad.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The dancing snowflakes lightly dusted the surroundings, leaving the dark world<p></p>
    <p></p>
    coated in a powdery whiteness. At the rate it was falling, the chance of the snow really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    piling up didn't seem very high.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If it's too heavy, though, public transit will shut down, so I hope it's only a light snow,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru commented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's very pragmatic of you," Amane remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "People can't survive on romance alone," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're exactly right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Albeit in an unusual way, the snow had brought them closer together, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They both smiled slightly, and Mahiru stood up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right then, I'll bring dinner over."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, bring it over?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I made beef stew at my place earlier. I thought for sure that if I roasted a whole turkey,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the two of us wouldn't be able to finish it…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It would never have even occurred to me to roast a turkey."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're just bad at cooking, Amane. For lunch tomorrow, I was thinking we could make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    omelet rices with beef stew on top."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That sounds so delicious…" Amane's mind had already leaped straight past tonight's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dinner and had started looking forward to tomorrow's lunch. "I like my eggs cooked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hard."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What a coincidence; I've always preferred them that way, too. Okay, I'm bringing the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stew pot over."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru sauntered out of Amane's apartment and headed back to her own place for a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    moment. Vacantly, Amane watched her as she left, reflecting on the turbulent day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He really hadn't expected to be discovered. His friends might have suspected that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something was up, and Amane had anticipated them growing curious, but he never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would've expected that Mahiru would simply step right onto center stage.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Part of him wished that their relationship could've stayed their secret for just a little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while longer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What am I thinking? Amane wondered. It was better this way. He no longer had to hide<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything from Itsuki and Chitose, which made his life much easier. So then why did<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he feel a bit wistful? Where was this strange feeling coming from? Though everything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had turned out okay, some part of Amane was still agitated, and he needed to relax.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did something happen?" Mahiru had returned, holding the stew pot, and she tilted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her head questioningly as she stared at Amane with a confused look.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's nothing." Amane straightened out his expression, but Mahiru still seemed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    puzzled for a good while by the expression she had spotted on his face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Phew, that was good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unsurprisingly, Mahiru's cooking had been delicious. With it being Christmas, she had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    made even more elaborate dishes than usual. She had turned the rest of her carefully<p></p>
    <p></p>
    simmered beef stew into a pot pie, which she and Amane had shared.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Splitting the pie open and eating the crispy, textured crust together with the rich sauce<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of the beef stew could only be described as a moment of sublime bliss.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had apparently prepared the pie dough especially for this. Truly impressed by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her culinary prowess, Amane loosed a contented sigh while polishing off his second<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pastry of the day, another product of Mahiru's skilled hands.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While making the dough for the pot pie, Mahiru had apparently taken the opportunity<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to prepare another type of sweet dough at the same time. She'd used it to make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    handmade mille-feuille for dessert. This girl was already working at a professional<p></p>
    <p></p>
    level.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm glad you like it… You sure ate plenty," Mahiru observed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm. Because it was delicious," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you for saying so."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had grown accustomed to seeing the faint, relieved smile that emerged on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's face whenever he complimented her food. He had made it his daily mission<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to see that expression, as it was so much softer than her usual reserved countenance.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though an embarrassing thought, Amane liked to think of it as a special kind of smile<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reserved just for him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…So tomorrow we're having omelets over rice, huh…? I'm really looking forward to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really do like eggs, don't you? You tore into those rolled dashi omelets with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    incredible enthusiasm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "They were delicious; I couldn't help it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though eggs were one of his favorite foods, Amane couldn't stand them if they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were badly cooked. The fact that he'd wolfed them down was just more proof of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's excellent preparation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though Amane recognized that it was awfully selfish to be keeping her cooking all to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself, he was not inclined to share with anybody else. The plan was to keep enjoying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it for as long as possible.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Amane, you look super happy when you're eating, you know?" Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course, because your cooking is so good," he replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm flattered, but… really, it's nothing that special."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, it definitely is… You need to get a better sense of your own worth…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This was the homemade food of an angel; there were more than a few boys who'd do<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anything to have some.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But to me, this is just the stuff I make every day."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm a lucky guy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Why's that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Because the stuff you make every day is so delicious."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was a boy ruled by his stomach, and being able to enjoy delicious, freshly made<p></p>
    <p></p>
    meals so regularly was, for him, the ultimate happiness.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How did you get so good at cooking anyway?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Someone important to me once said 'Make sure you grab anyone who makes you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    happy by the stomach,' and I took those words to heart," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry you ended up grabbing me instead."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm thinking of it as a rehearsal." Mahiru's candor caught Amane by surprise. A small<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smile spread across her lips.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…But seriously, whoever taught you must have been amazing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's right; they were an incredible cook. I'm still no match for them. Their cooking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tasted like pure happiness." Mahiru took on a faraway look with a gentle smile. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression felt reassuring to Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    From the way Mahiru described it, the person in question had obviously loved her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    very much, and Amane could tell that Mahiru had idolized them as well. She must have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been really lucky to have someone like that in her life.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I bet it was really good," Amane said, nodding. "But you know… to me, your cooking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is what tastes like happiness."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Leaving his mother aside for the moment, Amane's father was a decent cook, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's dishes suited Amane's tastes better. Mahiru's cooking was comforting yet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exciting, with a relaxing flavor that he didn't think he could get tired of, even if he had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it three times a day for the rest of his life. No matter how much he ate, he just wanted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more and more.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though, of course, he could never say that. It'd put too much of a burden on Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Suddenly, the girl stiffened. She looked like she'd been attacked in an unguarded<p></p>
    <p></p>
    moment. She stared at Amane with an innocent and somewhat vacant expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Mahiru?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah… it's nothing." Snapping back to her senses, Mahiru quickly shook her head, then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stared down at the floor. Hugging her favorite cushion tight, she let out a soft sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something about her had completely changed in the last few seconds. It was strangely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    endearing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What's up?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's just—to think that someone like me could make something taste like happiness…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't know why you're putting yourself down, but your food is so good that I want<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to eat it every day."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Th-thank you." Mahiru looked up at Amane with a bit of a bashful look and a small<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grin. The sight of it filled Amane with the urge to hide his face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This kind of expression was rare for Mahiru, but it inevitably set Amane's heart<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rattling in his chest, even though he'd constantly told himself that he wasn't interested<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in her like that. Seeing Mahiru's smiling visage stripped of its usual stony mask made<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him suddenly feel hot, and Amane worried that she would notice and get embarrassed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Say, um, Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Tomorrow we'll be meeting up around lunchtime, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unable to stand the atmosphere any longer, Amane forced a change of subject. Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't seem to take much notice, however, and she idly considered what Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, that's the plan, isn't it? We'll make lunch, then play games like we promised…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was it, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Unless… you don't want to?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I was just confirming. Really, even though we spent Christmas Eve together, are<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you sure it's okay to spend your next day with me, too?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If I hated the idea, I wouldn't have suggested it… I'm looking forward to it." Another<p></p>
    <p></p>
    small smile appeared on the gentle curve of Mahiru's lips.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yeah," Amane muttered. It was all he could do to turn away and hide his growing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    embarrassment.<p></p>

    14 Christmas for Two<p></p>
    When Mahiru arrived at Amane's apartment the following day, she seemed a little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    restless. It would've been perfectly understandable to be nervous about visiting the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    home of a member of the opposite sex on a holiday, but that didn't seem to be it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru wants to play games. She's probably just excited.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, this would be her first time ever playing a video game. In some ways, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was like a sheltered highborn young lady who knew little of the world at large.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Before we play, I'll make lunch, okay?" Mahiru confirmed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm. I'll have mine well-done, please," Amane answered casually.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know; I remember."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even dealing with such a demanding customer didn't seem to dampen the girl's mood.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With a flutter of her apron, she headed for the kitchen and began preparations for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lunch. From the way she was behaving, Mahiru seemed to be quite pleased.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt a little awkward and embarrassed about how much he had been looking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forward to this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It's just because I'm looking forward to enjoying the games, that's all, he told himself. <p></p>
    <p></p>
    It certainly was not that he had been excited about spending time alone with the
    <p></p>
    next-door angel. As he watched Mahiru's ponytail swaying back and forth,d<p></p>
    Amane smiled wryly to himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…How are you supposed to hold it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After lunch, the two of them settled on the sofa in front of the TV. Both were now<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looking straight at the screen.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane had asked her what game she wanted to play, it became apparent that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't even know where to start, so he'd booted up a well-known 2D game and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    handed her a controller. Unfortunately, Mahiru immediately got flustered as it became<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apparent that she had no idea what to do with it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, okay, so you move around with this joystick, and you jump with this button…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, usually so calm and collected, was looking back and forth between the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    controller and the TV as she manipulated her character on-screen. It was obvious that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this was her first time. She charged straight at the enemies without dodging, dying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    over and over again. Amane began to wonder if perhaps there were things even an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    angel couldn't do, though she did seem to be gradually improving, if ever so slowly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I can't win," Mahiru professed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Never mind clearing the stage—you haven't even defeated the first enemy," Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    observed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it's just a matter of practice; you gotta keep trying. Get that muscle memory."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane warned Mahiru that it would be a challenge, but she didn't seem ready to give<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up. It was charming to watch the girl tackle the game with such a serious expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't help but smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unfortunately, Mahiru was just too much of a beginner and kept on losing. Eventually,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it was obvious that she was growing frustrated. As she shot a glance at Amane, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could have sworn he heard a gamelike sound effect accompany her sullen face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, here, you need to do it like this…" Mahiru was sure to lose interest if she continued<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to metaphorically bash her head against a wall, so Amane put his hand on the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    controller she was holding and tried to physically show her what to do.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had cleared this game on countless occasions, so he was able to help Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    get through tough spots. Surprisingly, Mahiru was actually worse than the average<p></p>
    <p></p>
    player. Most people wouldn't have gotten stuck nearly as many times as she did, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane kept that thought private.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look, this enemy moves at a consistent speed in an irregular pattern, but if you watch<p></p>
    <p></p>
    here, he moves toward your character and speeds up as he approaches. Just watch<p></p>
    <p></p>
    your timing and jump."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane put his hand over Mahiru's smaller one and gripped the controller to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    manipulate the character on the TV, showing her how as he explained. On the screen,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the game character moved as Amane had said it would, avoiding the oncoming enemy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't much of a move, but it was apparently enough to impress Mahiru, who let out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a small gasp of astonishment. Her eyes, rimmed with long lashes, snapped wide open,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and her expression brightened.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The two were sitting closer together than they ever had before, and Amane noticed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for the first time that Mahiru's lower lashes were fairly long, too. Smiling, he watched<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru happily play.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane admired her beautiful profile, Mahiru turned toward him, possibly because<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she'd felt his eyes on her. He'd needed to get close in order to be able to reach the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    controller, so the two had ended up far nearer to each other than either had expected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Their arms and hands were even touching, and Amane could feel Mahiru's breath<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lightly grazing his skin. Amane found himself surrounded by warmth and a faint, sweet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fragrance.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "S-sorry…" Amane suddenly realized that his hands were almost completely covering<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's, and he pulled away in a panic, while Mahiru's eyes darted around the room<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as if she had only just realized they were touching at all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Blinking dramatically, Mahiru replied, "No… it's fine. I'm the one who should apologize."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The girl's cheeks had flushed scarlet, and Amane was filled with regret over what he'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    done.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru wasn't a fan of physical contact. No matter how used to each other they had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gotten, having someone touch her hands like that had probably been too much for her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thankfully, while she looked fairly embarrassed, she didn't appear upset or angry.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Really, I'm sorry," Amane said again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um, I'm not that bothered by it…," Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't you hate physical contact?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I was surprised but not upset. It's not like you're a stranger."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It seemed that today, the magnanimous angel had seen fit to forgive Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    transgression. Relieved at how easily Mahiru let it go, Amane restarted the game.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Fixing his eyes on the TV screen, Amane got ready to help Mahiru make some real<p></p>
    <p></p>
    progress in the game this time. Then he saw that her character had fallen off the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stage—a rather predictable outcome. Amane was seriously beginning to wonder if he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could do anything to help her get better.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In the end, Mahiru somehow managed to clear one level, whining all the while. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    two of them agreed that was probably a good stopping place for the time being.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If Amane kept making a total beginner face death, it would have a considerable effect<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on her motivation. His plan for now was to get her to try another game and loosen up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, you're tilting."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    To that end, next Amane had suggested a racing game, since that had some grounding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in the real world, but Mahiru was leaning with her entire body.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no gyroscopic control element to the game, so there was absolutely no need<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to physically move around. Amane wasn't sure whether Mahiru even noticed what she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was doing, but she swayed left and right with every turn she made in the game.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In contrast to the earlier game, this one was all about driving a car, and Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought it'd be easier, since pretty much everyone understood the concept of driving<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to some degree. Playing through the tutorial also might've helped, because even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though Mahiru's driving was a bit clumsy, she was able to handle the actual gameplay.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was trying her absolute hardest to perform well. Her body swayed this way and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that while she maintained a very serious expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This is ridiculously cute, Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was strangely adorable, rocking back and forth like a pendulum. Her intense<p></p>
    <p></p>
    focus and effort only made her look even cuter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With every turn, Mahiru's body automatically leaned way to the side. Eventually, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tumbled right onto Amane's lap, and he was forced to choke down a laugh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You really don't need to tilt your whole body, you know?" he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I-it wasn't on purpose," Mahiru replied sheepishly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I know. But still, you were leaning pretty far."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru sat back up, somehow keeping her trembling, pouty lips in check.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The girl had felt soft and light when she'd accidentally flopped on him. That much was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to be expected as Mahiru had a small build, but she was so slim that sometimes Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    worried she might snap in half.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Roused out of Amane's lap, Mahiru's cheeks were flushing, and her body was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    trembling, likely from embarrassment. It was times like these that the girl really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    resembled a small animal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Finally, Amane couldn't stand it anymore, and he burst into a fit of laughter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A-are you making fun of me?" Mahiru demanded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, no. I was just thinking how charming you are."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So you are making fun of me!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You think I'd mock someone while they're trying their best?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "See? You were just very cute; that's all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…When you say cute, I'm sure you mean childish."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was a bit of a peevish overtone to Mahiru's words, and Amane was worried she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    might get depressed if he teased too much; thus he decided to keep any further<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thoughts to himself. He flashed Mahiru a half smile in response to her expression of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    disapproval, and she quickly turned away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Any trace of the angel's gloomy mood vanished instantly when she returned to the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    game. Her intense concentration overrode everything else on her face. It was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    becoming clear that she was getting used to the game, as she was managing to keep<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up with the other cars, if a little awkwardly. Amane had been right to assume a more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    familiar concept like steering a car was better for Mahiru. She did still veer off course<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into the dirt or slam into a wall a few times, though.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been worried she might end up running the whole course backward, since<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she'd never played a game before, but he was relieved to see that she was making<p></p>
    <p></p>
    better progress than he'd expected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Trying to play the racing game together with Mahiru proved to be a little difficult, as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she kept distracting Amane without realizing it. As she tilted her whole body back and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forth with the game, she occasionally leaned right into him. Each time she did so, a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lovely scent would waft over him, making it difficult to keep his composure.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even with the unusual handicap, Amane still managed to maintain a huge lead. They<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were competing against the weakest computer opponents, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…How are you so fast?" Mahiru inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Practice and experience," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After playing the game so many times, Amane knew the course by heart and understood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    how to best navigate the turns. Even with Mahiru's outside interference, he was able<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to seize every advantage and hold the lead without much trouble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Glancing back at Mahiru, who appeared utterly dumbstruck, Amane quietly switched<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the game to solo mode and dropped out of the competition. Mahiru didn't have enough<p></p>
    <p></p>
    experience, so Amane thought it'd be better to play together after he let her practice<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by herself for a while. It was better that she got comfortable playing against computer
    <p></p>
    controlled characters rather than feel disappointed over losing to Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thankfully, it was clear that Mahiru had no shortage of determination, and she stared<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enthusiastically at the screen even after going to solo play. With an attitude like that,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was sure she would quickly learn to hold her own against a computer opponent.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was obvious what a hard worker she was, even with something like a video game.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Such perseverance was rather charming, but whenever Amane let a smile slip onto his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    face, Mahiru would quickly take notice and slap his knees in protest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he laughed too much, amused by her protests, Mahiru would frown and grumble,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, you idiot."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I won."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After two hours of dogged perseverance, Mahiru crossed the finish line as the words<p></p>
    <p></p>
    FIRST PLACE flashed across the screen. She turned to look at Amane, obviously proud<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After a hard-won battle with the racing game, Mahiru had achieved the glory of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    finishing first.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though she'd ended up in last place on so many earlier tries, Mahiru had refused to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quit and kept going, improving her ranking bit by bit until at last, she won. Such<p></p>
    <p></p>
    investment had probably made the victory quite emotional.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's expression seemed to proclaim "I did it!" and Amane dutifully clapped in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    admiration.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's great. I could tell you really tried hard," he praised.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yep!" Perhaps because Mahiru was enjoying the praise, her usual demeanor had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    softened, and she appeared a little bashful. She didn't break into a huge, obvious grin<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but instead wore a fleeting, shy curl of the lips that looked ever-so-slightly pleased. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed so sweet that it was hard to believe it belonged to the same cool, reserved<p></p>
    <p></p>
    person.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recently, Mahiru had been acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect<p></p>
    <p></p>
    young lady. Today most of all, she was really acting like a kid. Her cherubic smile had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something innocent about it, and looking at her, Amane felt his sense of reason begin<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to give way as the roaring desire to hold her close rose within him. The urge to pet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru like a cat seized control of his arm, and before he knew it, Amane found himself<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reaching out toward her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is something the matter?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Quickly, Amane regained control of his wayward limb. "Ah, n-no, it's nothing. You really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    got good at this, h-huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm getting better?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For sure. You're way better than when you first started."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you. It was a lot of fun, so I guess I got pretty engrossed." Mahiru chuckled to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane avoided making eye contact by crossing the room and retrieving a small box<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from a basket on the shelf. "Let's say this is your prize for first place," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, um, that's really not—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you don't like the idea of a prize, then think of this as something left behind by a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stout old man with a white beard and a red suit."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was a Christmas present that Amane had carelessly forgotten to give Mahiru the day<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Mahiru's birthday and Christmas weren't that far apart, Amane had expected<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some difficulty picking out this second gift. Thankfully, he'd also gotten a little more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    familiar with the practice, so it surprisingly wound up not being as tough to choose a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Christmas present as it had been finding one for Mahiru's birthday.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru blinked rapidly, as if the reference to a Christmas present had just reminded<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her that today was in fact Christmas, and she nervously accepted the box. At Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    urging, she carefully undid the wrapping.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Well, it's nothing special, though, Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She opened the box and slowly took out the gift. It was a leather key holder.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Expecting Mahiru to feel uncomfortable if Amane got her something too expensive,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had avoided getting a fancy brand-name item. He'd selected this one purely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because the design seemed like it would suit Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was simple, with flowers and ivy carved into the leather, making it perfect for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everyday use. Amane wasn't too well versed in flowers, so he didn't know exactly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    which ones were featured in the design, but he thought their dainty forms suited<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru well, and that's why he'd chosen it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I gave you my spare key and all. If you don't want to use it, that's okay, too,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I definitely will, thank you. You've got a better sense of style than I expected,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What do you mean, better than expected?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, normally you just wear sweatpants or jeans… It's not like you're into fashion<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I just don't own anything besides functional clothes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Getting dressed up in nicer outfits was a tedium that Amane avoided whenever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    possible. He'd never had the occasion to show Mahiru what he looked like in better<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clothing, so she'd only ever seen him in his school uniform and casual house clothes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was no wonder she assumed he had no fashion sense. Such a guess had been right<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the money, and Amane didn't seem likely to dispel that slovenly impression<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anytime soon.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…If you made an effort, you'd probably look pretty good, you know? You kept up your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    appearance in middle school, didn't you?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That was because my mom forced me to… Wait, how do you know that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shihoko sent me this picture and said, 'Here's what he could look like if he tried'…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Unbelievable."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was shocked to see the photo of the time his mother had dressed him up and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brought him to work. Silently, Amane cursed his mother's indiscretion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…That style didn't suit me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose you're right, Amane. You know, you never make eye contact, and your face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is always hidden behind your hair, but I think you have rather distinguished features…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's small hand stretched out toward Amane's face, and her white palm brushed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    against his forehead as she pushed his long bangs upward. She was looking at him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with a curious expression. He didn't think his face was anything to marvel over; it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    perfectly ordinary—not quite ugly and not quite handsome. Amane began to wonder<p></p>
    <p></p>
    why Mahiru was staring so intently at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What is it?" he asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing. Your eyes look livelier than they used to, that's all," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without looking away, Mahiru reminded Amane that several months earlier, his face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had been vacant like a zombie's.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While Mahiru continued to stare, Amane was beginning to feel uncomfortable that a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girl, not to mention an incredible beauty, was staring at him so intently. He wondered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    what she found so fascinating about his boring looks.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Eventually, he couldn't stand it anymore. Amane slowly reached out and brushed a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lock of hair away from Mahiru's own lovely face. He was hesitant to touch her, but she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had reached out and touched his hair so casually that he thought she'd probably<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forgive him for doing the same. It would only be the faintest moment of contact; surely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that much would be all right.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But wow, she really is beautiful…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was much prettier than the glamorous models in the magazines that had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    previously been scattered around Amane's room—and much more appealing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something about her felt amazing every time he looked upon her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Photographs, Amane knew, couldn't be trusted anyway. Even if they could capture a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    moment of beauty, preserving it in time, photographs could be made to deceive.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, however, was standing there before him in the flesh. Her beauty was real—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unadulterated. Amane didn't think he could ever get tired of beholding such a creature.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane continued studying her features, Mahiru's eyes started to shift, and she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pulled away from him, dropping her controller. Amane wondered what was bothering<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her as she hugged a nearby couch cushion tight against her chest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um. So… right. I have a Christmas present for you, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um, oh, thanks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was about to ask what on earth it might be, when Mahiru cut him off by pulling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out a nicely decorated gift bag from her purse. Hastily, she pushed it into his hands.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, I'm going to prepare dinner."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? Y-you are…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With those words, Mahiru quickly stood and moved to the kitchen. Amane was left<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with nothing but bewilderment at the overly rapid development.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After Amane finished washing the dishes from dinner, he returned to the living room<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to find that Mahiru was restless. She was sitting beside him, in the way they had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    recently grown accustomed to, but this time, Mahiru was having trouble maintaining<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her composure. She'd been averting her gaze all through dinner, too.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This was a kind of self-consciousness that Mahiru had seemed previously incapable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of, prompting Amane to wonder if something had happened. Perhaps it had something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to do with her giving him the gift? When Amane had given Mahiru the teddy bear, he,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too, had felt like running away, and it'd been difficult for him to calm down. Maybe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was experiencing a similar sort of anxiety.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "By the way, can I open this?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "P-please do."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane picked up the gift from where he'd left it sitting atop the coffee table, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru nodded somewhat hesitantly. Concluding that she was indeed nervous about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    giving him a present, Amane untied the ribbon fastening the bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Right away, he could tell from the feel and weight that it was something made out of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cloth. When Amane pulled it out and saw it to be a length of black-and-white<p></p>
    <p></p>
    houndstooth, he wasn't sure what it was. After spreading out the whole object,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    however, he immediately understood.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A scarf?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It appeared to be quite soft and luxurious. Surely, this would keep him warm if he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wound it around his neck.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, you're indifferent to fashion, and you always seem cold on the way to school,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can really use it; and wow, it feels so nice."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Quality is important when you're choosing something that you'll be using every day,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Mahiru was someone who only wore high-quality clothes, Amane was sure she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    knew what she was talking about. Mahiru seemed like the type who considered it a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    waste of time to buy cheap things, preferring to use well-made products that would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    last for a long time, instead. If this scarf met her standards, it had to be very nice<p></p>
    <p></p>
    indeed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could tell just by touching it that the scarf had a luxurious texture and was soft<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough not to bother even sensitive skin.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Impressed with Mahiru's high standards, Amane waved the gift at her while she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    watched him with a stiff expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Can I try it on?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I gave it to you, so you can do whatever you like," Mahiru answered curtly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Roger."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane smiled at her blunt response and wrapped the scarf around himself. He could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feel the quality of the fabric even more on his neck, where the skin was more sensitive.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It kept all the warmth in without letting too much air pass through. The feel of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fabric was soothing and snug. As Amane was still inside, it was hard to tell just how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    effective the scarf would be, but he trusted it would undoubtedly keep him comfortable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    throughout the winter months.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wow, it's super warm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's great."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane put on a gentle smile, and Mahiru answered with a relieved smile of her own.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recently, Mahiru had begun to show Amane her many kinds of smiles more frequently,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and he found himself staring again at her enchanting features.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …When she looks like that, she really does seem like an angel…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sure, everyone at school said Mahiru looked heavenly, but Amane thought it was far<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more attractive when she smiled like this and showed her true self.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wh-what is it?" Mahiru had noticed that Amane was staring straight at her. Her eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shifted left and right before fixing themselves back on the one gazing at her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing; I was just thinking that you seem much more relaxed compared to when I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    first met you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Is that so?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked surprised, and Amane laughed a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah. Before, you were all stuck-up and not cute at all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That was terrible of me, not being cute," Mahiru said sarcastically.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on—don't sulk… Now you're way more… How should I put it? I think you just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look better. I was thinking that the way you smile now is way cuter. It's really kind of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a shame you weren't smiling like that sooner."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had always been beautiful, but some quality of that changed in how she carried<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The angelic smile that she showed at school had the beauty of something to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    appreciated from a distance. It was a fragile thing that was not be touched.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The cold look that she'd first given Amane held the appeal of something wreathed in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thorns to keep humans from getting too close.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now her soft and innocent smile had a welcoming warmth that made Amane want to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    caress and cherish her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought about how Mahiru had changed. She'd slowly gotten used to being<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around him, and she'd slowly opened up her heart. As he thought back on the time<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they'd spent together, Amane felt a ticklish sensation gradually rising through his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chest and up into his cheeks.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm happy that you can smile so naturally now, and that you've gotten used to hanging<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around with me, and… What are you doing?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's sentence was physically cut off as Mahiru lifted the scarf up from around his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    neck to cover his face with the fabric. She didn't wrap it tight, but it grew a bit stuffy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and hot as the material trapped Amane's breath.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Please just be quiet for a bit," Mahiru commanded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What for?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't understand this sudden outburst of eccentric behavior. He grabbed the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wrist of her hand that was holding up the scarf and pushed it back down. With his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    vision restored, he could see Mahiru's flaxen hair and the tinge of color spread across<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her cheeks, and he noticed that she was trembling slightly. As she looked at him, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grew even more flushed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He wondered why she was making such an odd face, and then it suddenly hit him that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there could be only one answer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Don't tell me… you're embarrassed?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru turned away sharply, which only served to confirm what Amane had said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without meaning to, Amane smiled as he mused that the angel sure could be prickly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about things like this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru groaned and quietly muttered, "I'm going outside for some air." Then she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quickly made for the veranda.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Through the window, Amane could see it snowing just like it had the day before, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't seem to care and stepped out onto the balcony anyway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chilly air rushed into the apartment, and Amane shivered. Though Mahiru immediately<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shut the door, a touch of cold still hung about the living room. Amane let out a quiet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It's fine for her to run away to hide her embarrassment, but she could at least do it in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slightly warmer outfit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had obviously picked her clothes assuming she would be spending the day<p></p>
    <p></p>
    inside—or at least wearing a heavy jacket if she went out. She'd clearly prioritized<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looks over warmth, and her slender body was sure to chill quickly in the cold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane cursed under his breath and picked up the blanket that was lying over the back<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of the sofa.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It's super dangerous to stand outside in the snow wearing such thin clothing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After pulling on his coat, Amane followed Mahiru out onto the veranda and wrapped<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the blanket around her shoulders.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Getting some fresh air is fine, but you'll catch a cold like that," chided Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru quickly turned to face him. "…Isn't that my line?" Clearly, she'd calmed down,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as she'd answered with her usual demeanor and expression, though there was a bit of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a sulking tone to her voice. Maybe she was feeling down because Amane had said<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something that called back to the conversation from when they'd first met.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmph. That only happened because I didn't get in a bath and warm up like I should<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have. Simple negligence," Amane reminded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Next time you get soaked like a drowned rat, make sure you warm yourself up right.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If I'm there, I'll be sure to toss you in the bath myself," Mahiru shot back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What're you, my mom?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There were definitely times when Mahiru said some rather motherly things.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With a smile, Amane recalled his first encounter with the angel. It'd been around the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    time autumn usually started getting cold, about halfway through October. He hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expected to come down with a fever just from getting a little wet, but the weather had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gotten chillier far faster than it usually did back in his hometown. Thinking back on it,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane admitted to himself that perhaps he really had been careless.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The most surprising part of the whole situation, however, had definitely been Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nursing him back to health.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Y'know, it's already been two months since we started talking…," Amane said<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wistfully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're right. And to think, your room was so dirty! It was terrible… Now it only haunts<p></p>
    <p></p>
    my memories," Mahiru quipped.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, hush. I'm keeping it clean now, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And who do you owe for that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why, Lady Mahiru, of course. It makes me want to bow down in humble gratitude."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't need to do that, geez."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Back on that rainy day, Amane would never have believed that he and Mahiru would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    get to a point where they could banter like this. It all seemed so long ago now, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really, it had only been a short while back. A lot had changed in those two months.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Time had really flown by.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A silence fell over the two, and suddenly, everything was quiet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The snow, which had been starting and stopping in fits since yesterday, was now<p></p>
    <p></p>
    drifting softly down from the sky, painting the surrounding apartment buildings in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pale hue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane and Mahiru's building was in residential area, plus it was Christmas, so the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    area was hushed. From some apartment nearby, the pair could very faintly hear the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sounds of a Christmas song, though not well enough to decipher any lyrics.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru exhaled a little white puff, and Amane's ears caught that sound better than any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    other.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's kind of a strange feeling." Mahiru was the one to break the silence. "At first, I was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wondering 'What's up with this guy?'"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I guess that's not surprising. Anyone would be suspicious if someone suddenly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forced an umbrella on them… What do you think now?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm, let's see. I'd have to say… you're a whole lot of work." Mahiru turned away after<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her ambiguous answer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're not wrong." Amane smiled while leaning against the veranda railing. "…You<p></p>
    <p></p>
    know, I never thought that we would get close enough to be eating meals together like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this, either. To be honest, I always thought of you as someone to be admired from a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    distance. I never considered ever getting involved with you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That was certainly honest… though I knew that already. That's precisely why I trust<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you," Mahiru said, and her body shook with laughter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane knew that Mahiru only accepted him in her life because he wasn't attracted to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her; and apparently, she felt the same way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Still, I'm glad that I got to know you like this. My life has really improved a ton, I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    happy because I get to eat delicious food every day, and I feel at ease when I'm hanging<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out with you," Amane declared.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You really think so?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I do. I'm incredibly grateful for these past two months. Thank you." Amane couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have been more sincere if he tried. It was thanks to Mahiru that his standard of living<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had gone up and that he got to enjoy a delicious meal every day. Surprisingly, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had also discovered that he could enjoy talking to a girl without any sort of awkward<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expectations. It'd even become something he looked forward to. Even better, Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would occasionally flash him adorable reactions when Amane teased her, and he never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    got tired of those.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recently, she's started to laugh more, too.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane had realized before, Mahiru had indeed started displaying a richer array of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    emotions, a change that only made her more endearing. Amane would never actually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    act on his feelings, of course, but… just looking at her made him feel at peace.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes were wide, and Amane couldn't tell whether the slight redness in her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cheeks was because of the cold or because she was embarrassed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, thank you very much," she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But I didn't do anything." From Amane's perspective, Mahiru was the one who'd done<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything for him. He was sure he hadn't given the girl anything in return, but she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slowly shook her head in disagreement.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm grateful for things that you aren't aware of, Amane," Mahiru explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm… Each of us telling the other what we're thankful for has sort of an end-of-the
    <p></p>
    year vibe. I guess that's not all that weird, since the year is about to end."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Curiously, both Amane and Mahiru had thanked the other for certain things, despite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the new year still being six days away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes sparkled at the mention of the end of the year, and she let a little laugh<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slip out. "Ha-ha, that's right. It's still a little early, but… Happy New Year, Amane. Let's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    make it a good one."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yeah, Happy New Year." Amane nodded and smiled at Mahiru's heaven-sent proposal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Then Mahiru suddenly said, "I'm freezing; let's go on inside, shall we?" She turned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around and opened the glass door that led back to Amane's living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane caught a glimpse of her ears, which had turned bright red in the frosty air, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he agreed that it was best to retreat inside so as not to catch cold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …One way or another, I guess I've also taken a liking to this lifestyle. That's probably why<p></p>
    <p></p>
    my chest feels so warm. As he followed Mahiru back into the apartment, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    watched the gentle swaying of her soft, flaxen hair and smiled secretly to himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hoped that in the days to come, he would continue to see more of the angel who<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lived next door.<p></p>
    <p></p>

    15 A Power Outage, Anxiety, and Warmth<p></p>
    "Ah!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hadn't expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to the television. It was a total blackout.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn't suffered any damage, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he would have to check the other appliances later.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, there was no reply.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Mahiru?" he called out anxiously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    arm… It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    voice come from the floor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What a disgrace…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Um, sorry I startled you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…No. I startled myself; that's all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around and found her original position.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn't seem to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane's shirt<p></p>
    <p></p>
    again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    again. This time, she didn't fall off the sofa.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Looking for something?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Are you being sarcastic?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why in the world would I be?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not that much of an ass."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily—but she was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the hem of Amane's shirt, but she didn't make any moves to brush off his hand. He had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…So I guess you're not a big fan of the dark?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I don't hate it, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm-hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I just don't like it when it's bright one moment and dark the next—that's all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not really afraid of the dark, and I don't feel scared."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure, yeah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru added in a small voice, "…There's just one thing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…When we sit like this, I know I'm not alone, and I feel better," Mahiru mumbled. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sounded relieved.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I see," said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…The power's back on. I'm going to check my appliances."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's hold and stood up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears<p></p>
    <p></p>
    poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small "Thank you" and couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    help but stare at her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's weird," he muttered as he turned away bashfully<p></p>
    <p></p>
    16 Spending the End of the Year with the Angel<p></p>
    Once Christmas had passed, the whole world could feel the end of the year approaching.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The day after spending Christmas with Mahiru, Amane went out to do a bit of shopping<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on his own. By the time he was finished, his surroundings had undergone a dramatic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shift, and Amane admired the new scenery on his way home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The lights strung up around the city remained, but the ornamented trees and Christmas<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decorations had already been replaced with more traditional Japanese adornments.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The shops had also updated their merchandise, selling New Year's decorations and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    foods. If there were any Christmas things still in stock, at best they had been reduced<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in price and were displayed under INVENTORY CLEAR-OUT SALE labels.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane nestled his face deeper into the billowy folds of his scarf as he pondered the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sudden changeover. Mahiru had given him the monochrome houndstooth-patterned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    scarf as a Christmas present. It was both practical and tasteful; it looked stylish and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    felt very nice to the touch, and most importantly, it kept the chilly winter winds at bay.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had never really worn a scarf before, so he was feeling grateful for this one as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he checked over the contents of the shopping bags hanging from his arms.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though the two of them were supposed to share this responsibility—in order to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reduce the burden on Mahiru, who did all the cooking—Amane usually went out to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    buy the ingredients, armed with a shopping list.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was a cold day, and Amane's bags were stuffed with vegetables and mushrooms and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    meat—Mahiru must have been planning to make a hot pot. The plentiful vegetables<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were her way of wordlessly insisting that Amane eat a more balanced, nutritious diet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He laughed quietly to himself, amused that Mahiru was somehow still looking out for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him even when she wasn't actually present.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He checked again to be sure that he'd gotten everything, then quickly returned home,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shivering against the relentless cold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Welcome back."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was already evening when Amane entered his apartment, and Mahiru was there to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    greet him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was kind of a strange feeling, being welcomed into his own apartment, but recently<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had gotten used to it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm, I'm back… I bought some thinly sliced mochi; I hope that's okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You want to cook it in the hot pot, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah. I also got some ramen to finish off the meal."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…There's no way I can eat that much, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't worry, I'll make sure it doesn't go to waste."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had never been the type to eat huge meals before, but now, thanks to Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooking, he had started enjoying more sizable dinners. In fact, he found his new<p></p>
    <p></p>
    portion sizes a bit concerning and had resolved to start weight training.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed to be watching her diet as well. She rarely prepared any fattening<p></p>
    <p></p>
    foods. On the other hand, she also seemed to think that Amane could stand to put on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a bit of weight, since he was so slim. Amane hoped he would add muscle and not fat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if you're going to finish it, then that's fine. Here, give me the bags. I'll put the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    things in the fridge. You go wash your hands."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know, I know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane handed the full shopping bags to Mahiru and obediently headed for the sink.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come to think of it, what are you doing for New Year's, Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After finishing every last bite of the day's delicious meal, as always, Amane suddenly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asked Mahiru the question that had been weighing on his mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "New Year's… Well, there's no point in going home, so I'll be here."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He realized his blunder when he heard her indifferent tone, but Mahiru didn't actually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seem all that bothered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her relationship with her parents wasn't good, so she always had a cold attitude<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whenever the conversation turned to her family.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But if that's the case, won't Mahiru be spending the holiday alone?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had his standing promise to show his face at home once every six months, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had been planning to visit during the long break—that was before he had met<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're going back home, right, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's right; I'm pretty much under orders to show up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He glanced over at her and saw that the expression in her eyes was somewhat chillier<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than usual. She seemed to have resolved herself to spending the holiday alone, what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with Amane going away and all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Man, when I get home, I'm gonna get absolutely grilled about you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How terrible…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can probably get by with just giving my dad the basics, but my mom is going to want<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to hear a whole lot more."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's awfully strange, since I talk to her all the time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really got familiar with my mom in no time…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For some reason, Mahiru had made fast friends with Amane's mother and, without<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him noticing, had been sending her photos and private stories… which frankly killed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him a little inside. But Mahiru obviously enjoyed it, so Amane didn't see any harm in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it. He only hoped she wasn't telling his mother anything more than she absolutely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    needed to know.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recalling the distant, lonely expression that crossed Mahiru's face from time to time,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane decided that he didn't want to leave her here alone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I did just see Mom a little while ago… I would miss seeing Dad, but I wonder if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it would be all right if I didn't go home for the New Year… Besides, I'm supposed to go<p></p>
    <p></p>
    back during spring vacation anyway."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was thinking that if he stayed here for the holiday, they could continue having<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dinner together like always… that is, if it wasn't too much of an imposition on Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Oh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm. Plus, I want to eat your New Year's noodles."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What a glutton you are."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's all because of your cooking."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Even when it's ready-made?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even if she only boiled the prepackaged soba noodles, Amane was sure he would still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enjoy them. Because the important thing about their shared meals was the time they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    spent together.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're an awfully strange person," Mahiru remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, hush."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He saw her smile slightly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What for?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For whatever."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't say anything further, but her expression brightened somewhat, and she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    squeezed her favorite cushion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    And then December 31 arrived. New Year's Eve was bringing the year to a close. For<p></p>
    <p></p>
    many, it was a busy day, spent cleaning and preparing for the year to come, but—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um, hey, Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What is it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Are you sure you don't want me to help with anything?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    From his position sitting comfortably on the living room couch, Amane was gazing at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's back as she was standing apron-clad in his kitchen. She had been in there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    since that morning, making osechi, the traditional fare for the New Year holiday.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since they had decided to ring in the New Year together, naturally they needed enough<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to feed two.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had assumed they would be purchasing it premade, but apparently Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    intended to make it all by hand. That would have been quite a task even for a skilled<p></p>
    <p></p>
    homemaker, so it was surprising for even this brilliant high school girl to tackle it all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    alone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was seriously impressed, but Mahiru had said, "Well, there's no way we can get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    osechi from a store now. You have to order it well in advance."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Admittedly, she was absolutely right, but even so, Amane admired Mahiru for deciding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to make everything herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, she took shortcuts where she could. For instance, boiling their own black<p></p>
    <p></p>
    soybeans would be very time-consuming and keep one burner occupied for far too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    long, so they had bought some prepared soybeans instead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, you seem uncomfortable whenever I say you don't have to do anything, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    do you have any idea how you might go about helping me?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Honestly, no clue."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I thought so. It's easier if you just stay out of the way."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't really argue with Mahiru's harsh assessment, so he tried to sit quietly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the sofa, but he found it impossible to settle down and do nothing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't that Amane hadn't done anything at all—he'd finished cleaning his apartment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the day before, and earlier he'd gone on a big shopping run, picking up ingredients for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the osechi dishes along with enough food so that they wouldn't have to go out for a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while. He had taken care of the more physical tasks, but at the moment, Mahiru was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    busy, and he wasn't doing much.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You must be tired from moving all the furniture and appliances yesterday to clean, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    please, just take it easy," Mahiru said without turning around, though Amane thought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he heard a note of concern in her voice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It appeared that Mahiru had already finished her own New Year's cleaning. Apparently,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it hadn't taken much work at all since she always kept her place so tidy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So that's the difference between someone who makes a habit of keeping things clean and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone who doesn't, Amane mused. Guess I should've realized that earlier…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, even so, I feel bad about it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I really like cooking, so it's no trouble."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Still…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine; I'm having fun."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was at a loss for how to react to Mahiru, who brushed him off, fully absorbed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in her work.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, I went ahead and bought lunch."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It would have been unfair to expect Mahiru to prepare lunch when she had her hands<p></p>
    <p></p>
    full with the osechi, so Amane had gone to the convenience store. He'd figured there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would be no problem with a simple meal of sandwiches, since Mahiru didn't eat that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much anyway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had already taken off her apron. She must have been planning to take a break,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so the timing seemed just about perfect.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks for going to the trouble," Mahiru said as she stepped into the living room. Her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    break would double as lunchtime. "I'm really sorry for not getting around to making<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lunch."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, I'm definitely the one who should be apologizing, with you making all that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    osechi. Here, let's eat. How's a sandwich and cafe au lait sound?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's fine, thank you," Mahiru said as she accepted the food, then took a seat beside<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him on the couch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So about how much have you gotten done so far?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I'm using a lot of premade ingredients, and I'm trying not to limit the number<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of dishes, so… I'd say I'm nearly finished. After this, there are a lot of things that need<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to rest or chill in the fridge. You seem to like sweet rolled omelets, Amane, so I made<p></p>
    <p></p>
    those by hand."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How did you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You like all the other egg dishes I make. I didn't think that rolled omelets would be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the exception."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He surmised that she had cooked them specially in the oven. He had heard it humming<p></p>
    <p></p>
    earlier and wondered what she was making.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You like the ones that are slightly sweet, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You know me too well."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not surprising that I would learn your tastes after several months," Mahiru said<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as she bit into her ham and lettuce sandwich. It made him very happy to hear that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane started eating the rice ball he had bought for himself, he looked over into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the kitchen. His eyes landed on the smallish multitiered food boxes that Mahiru had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brought over with her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She must be planning to pack the food into those boxes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hadn't expected her to go so far as to bring out the special boxes for all the food—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    after all, she lived alone, just like him—so he had been a little shocked to see the fancy
    <p></p>
    looking containers all painted with lacquer and decorated with gold leaf.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Seriously, I can't thank you enough. How do I put this…? This past year, I've gotten to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enjoy food in a way I never could have imagined when I first started living alone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And here I thought you were doing just fine on your own."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Rude. You know better than anyone how I was surviving off convenience store meals."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It certainly wasn't healthy. That's for sure." Mahiru let out an exasperated sigh, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she also wore a knowing smile, which caught Amane by surprise. "Well, now that I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    here," she added, "I won't let you fall back into your old unhealthy habits, all right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Who are you, my mom?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's your own fault for living like that. Next year you're really going to learn how to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eat properly. Do I make myself clear?" Mahiru's eyes shone with sudden enthusiasm.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane realized that she had just announced her intention to spend the coming year<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with him as well. The thought made him feel terribly self-conscious, and he found<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself looking away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, Mahiru must have interpreted that gesture as a reluctance to give up his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slothful ways because she promptly scowled at Amane, who found himself struggling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to awkwardly explain himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru finished making and packing up all the osechi dishes by around sunset and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    then set about preparing the New Year's noodles, which just entailed boiling the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    noodles and readying the toppings, since they had bought precut raw noodles.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She had some kamaboko fish cake left over from the osechi, so that was a perfect<p></p>
    <p></p>
    addition. All there was left to do was parboil the spinach and slice the green onion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The most labor-intensive part was the shrimp tempura, but Mahiru seemed to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    having no trouble as she fried them all up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I also had some kabocha left over, so I'm going to fry that while I'm at it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Man… these are gonna be some serious New Year's noodles."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sometimes it's fun to make stuff like this," Mahiru said as she finished serving up the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    noodles. They looked far more splendid than anything most people would normally<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eat at home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She had made two large pieces of shrimp tempura per bowl, and the bonus kabocha<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tempura was crisped to perfection. There was plenty of spinach and green onion, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the kamaboko fish cake was cut into a decorative fan shape.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane noticed that Mahiru liked to keep her tempura crispy, as both of their portions<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had been placed on separate plates rather than directly in the bowl with the noodles.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was grateful for this small, thoughtful act.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wow!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Please, eat up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Perhaps concerned that the noodles wouldn't be enough to satisfy Amane's appetite,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had also served all the leftover bits from the osechi dishes on a small plate.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane watched Mahiru take her seat, then they both pressed their hands together to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    give thanks for the food before digging into their noodles.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though Mahiru had said that the soba had come premade, she must have picked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out high-quality noodles. Amane could smell the rich fragrance of buckwheat with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    every bite. The broth wasn't too thick or too thin, and it was seasoned so well he sighed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with delight. It warmed him from the depths of his belly. The perfect dish for a cold<p></p>
    <p></p>
    day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah… now this is what the end of the year should feel like…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He took a sip of broth and sighed… mumbling quietly to himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was certainly enjoying the chance to sit back and watch TV while eating his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    noodles, awaiting the arrival of the New Year.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was also his family's custom every year to eat New Year's noodles and spend New<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Year's Eve watching the year-end musical specials on television, so Amane was glad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he could keep the tradition going.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But tonight he was not sitting with his family—instead, there was a beautiful girl<p></p>
    <p></p>
    beside him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "When you eat New Year's noodles, it hits you all at once that the year's really ending,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doesn't it?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know what you mean…," Amane replied. "So much happened this year."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, he was mostly talking about his burgeoning relationship with Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he'd first started living alone, he couldn't possibly have imagined such a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    beautiful girl fixing him such delicious meals.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, because this was the year you started living alone, right, Amane? That must have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been difficult."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You, on the other hand, never seem to have any trouble, do you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that's because I can more or less do everything for myself. It's a disaster for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone like you, trying to live on your own even though you don't know how to do<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh… that's true, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really are the definition of hopeless, aren't you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The expression on Mahiru's face was gentle as she scolded him, more charming than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exasperated. She didn't seem burdened by taking care of Amane. She just looked…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    content.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I owe you for everything you've done this year."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He repeated the words of thanks that he had said to her on Christmas, and Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smiled slightly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And don't you ever forget it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her quick and unconditional agreement prickled slightly in his chest, but his saving<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grace was that Mahiru clearly didn't mean anything.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I hope you'll help me out next year, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know I'll need to. If I wasn't around, you'd barrel headlong into an unhealthy and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slovenly lifestyle again in no time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can't deny that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…If you're aware of it, then you ought to do better…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'll aspire to do so in the coming year."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even if he did put his mind to it, Amane had a feeling that Mahiru's constant caretaking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would quickly erode any desire to fend for himself. Of course, he couldn't say that out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    loud, so he pushed the thought to the back of his mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd do his best to keep his place tidy, but there was no doubt that he would still be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    depending on her for meals. He had become entirely domesticated, and the fact that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was painfully aware of this development didn't make it any less true. Plus, Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    always laughed at him whenever he said he was going to try to improve himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane made a sour face, but Mahiru just smiled slightly, as if she was savoring the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    moment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The New Year's almost upon us."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Looks like it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They had finished eating their New Year's noodles and sat on the sofa watching the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    annual end-of-the-year musical showcase on television. Before either of them realized<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it, the new day—and the New Year—was just moments away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Time had passed much faster than Amane had expected while he was occupied<p></p>
    <p></p>
    watching Mahiru quietly enjoy the show. Apparently, she wasn't very familiar with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    current pop music, possibly because she didn't watch much TV in general.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The screen switched over to a scene of a temple bell—a clear sign the year was about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to end. The great bell began ringing. Seated next to him, Mahiru quietly listened to the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chimes, eyes lowered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As the bell rang the one hundred and seventh time—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The instant that the new day began, Mahiru turned to him, sat up properly, and bowed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Happy New Year," she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Caught up in the moment, Amane also straightened up and gave her the same formal<p></p>
    <p></p>
    New Year's greeting. "Happy New Year… It feels kind of strange, huh? Spending it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    together."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Heh-heh, I suppose it does," Mahiru replied. "I hope you'll look after me this year as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    well."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course… Though, it feels like I should really be the one asking you that, eh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can't argue with that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru let out a giggle, and Amane shot her a slightly awkward grin. Then the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smartphone he had on his lap began to vibrate. His messaging app had several<p></p>
    <p></p>
    notifications—New Year's greetings had come in from Itsuki and Chitose.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's phone also vibrated. She had only just met his friends and hadn't exchanged<p></p>
    <p></p>
    contact info with Chitose yet, so she must have been getting messages from a friend<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't know.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In recent years, the convenience of sending New Year's greetings via phone message<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had become really popular.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm just going to reply to this."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Same."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane figured that Mahiru had probably received a lot of messages. Yet somehow he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    also had the feeling that she wasn't in the habit of giving boys her contact information.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane watched Mahiru's practiced fingers flit deftly across her phone as she typed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out her responses. "It's times like these that you finally seem like a regular high school<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girl," he remarked before checking his own phone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The messages from Itsuki and Chitose were the bog-standard 'Happy New Year'<p></p>
    <p></p>
    followed by needless prying. "Did you spend the New Year holiday getting friendly with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Lady Shiina?" As usual, Itsuki was disconcertingly perceptive.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sent a reply denying it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Immediately, he got a mocking response from Itsuki, accusing him of lying. For a while,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the two friends carried on a lively text conversation. Itsuki would make certain<p></p>
    <p></p>
    allegations that Amane would deny every time, and then… he felt a weight flop down<p></p>
    <p></p>
    against his upper arm.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A sweet fragrance wafted over him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The sudden contact startled him. He glanced timidly to the side, not believing it could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be true… only to confirm that Mahiru was indeed leaning against him, fast asleep.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    —Wait, wait, wait!<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't say anything out loud, but he was already beginning to panic on the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    inside.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had dozed off at his place before, but who could have ever imagined that she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would do so here and now, right beside him, pressed up against his shoulder?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was obvious what had happened.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They had stayed up quite late, past twelve thirty AM. Mahiru, who observed a strict<p></p>
    <p></p>
    routine, probably wasn't used to being awake at this hour. Moreover, she had spent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    most of the day bustling about making the osechi dishes and must have been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exhausted, even if she didn't show it on the surface. She simply hadn't had the strength<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to fight off the sandman any longer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane completely understood—but to fall asleep now of all times!<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Dozing against Amane's shoulder, Mahiru wore a truly peaceful expression, completely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    oblivious to his confusion and consternation. Her long eyelashes and cute nose and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pink lips all had a soft vulnerability to them that Amane hadn't noticed before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't the first time he'd seen her sleeping face, but he had never observed her from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    such close range, and the sight froze him in place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru…," he said hesitantly. "Mahiru, wake up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no response.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru must have been incredibly tired. It seemed that her fatigue had dragged her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down into the deepest oceans of slumber. He called out to her and nudged her with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his shoulder, but the girl showed no sign of waking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even when he tapped her shoulder and gently shook her body, Mahiru didn't stir.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His attempts to rouse her caused her to start pitching forward after slipping off his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    arm. In a panic, Amane caught her and pulled her back toward him… which was fine,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but now he found himself embracing her. His alarm only grew.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …Wow, she smells amazing…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After dinner, Mahiru had briefly gone back to her place to freshen up, and the floral<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fragrance of her shampoo that mingled with her natural scent was making Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tremendously uncomfortable. And he couldn't help but notice how soft she was,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pressed up against him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was not handling this well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had tried to wake her, but she had fallen too deeply asleep, and he was reluctant to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    try to rouse her more forcefully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What should I do?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The New Year had barely started, and Amane was already facing an unbelievable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dilemma.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He looked down at the girl sleeping in his arms with grim determination. She was still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out cold. She must really trust me to drift off like that without a care, Amane realized. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was enough to make him want to bang his head against the wall in frustration and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    embarrassment as his sense of reason began to fail him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No matter how he tried, his attention kept straying back to the distinct feeling of her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slender body pressed against his. It was firm, but with a feminine softness to it, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had a particularly intoxicating voluptuousness where their chests met…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    —What the heck should I do?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Not only was Amane utterly unprepared for his present situation, the unimaginable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    softness brushing against him was quickly wearing away at any remaining composure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he thought he possessed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This was the first time he had ever realized how soft and supple and nice-smelling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girls could be… and even thinking about how he felt was enough to send his mind<p></p>
    <p></p>
    spinning into chaos. It was like one big feedback loop.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even so, he still felt compelled to do something. He had a feeling that there was not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    going to be an easy way out of this one, so Amane tried to clear his mind and steel his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    resolve.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At the moment, there were three ways he could think of to approach this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    1. Wake Mahiru forcefully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    2. Carry Mahiru home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    3. Let Mahiru sleep in his own bed—and spend the night on the couch himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The first option gave him pause. He didn't like the idea of jostling Mahiru awake when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was obviously so very tired. What's more, he was the one responsible for wearing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her out, so if it was possible, he wanted to let her rest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At first glance, option two initially seemed like it would be the least awkward, but he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was really uncomfortable with the idea of searching through Mahiru's pockets for the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    key to her apartment and entering a girl's home without permission. He also suspected<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Mahiru would not be too pleased to discover that he'd decided that on his own.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Option three, letting her stay over, was seemed like a safer choice that would be easy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to pull off, but… he was not at all emotionally prepared to have a beautiful girl sleeping<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in his bed. It didn't matter how they normally got along. Amane felt like the innocent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    charm of her sleeping face was driving him mad.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The thought of such a stunning beauty asleep on his pillow was almost unbearable for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this growing boy. Some of the images that crossed his mind were guilt-inducing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Still, there was no denying it was the most promising option and the most considerate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    compromise that Amane could think of.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He steadied himself for the task, then gently wrapped his hands around Mahiru's back<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and under her knees and slowly lifted her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was sleeping soundly and was as light as a feather. Of course he would never say<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so out loud, but Mahiru felt almost ephemeral in his arms.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had learned firsthand that she probably wouldn't wake up too easily, but just in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    case, Amane tried to keep her as steady as possible while he gingerly carried her to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his room. It took both hands to cradle her, so opening the door proved quite the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    challenge, but eventually Amane successfully laid Mahiru on his bed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her delicate body sunk into the mattress.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once Amane had covered her with a blanket and comforter, she was all set up for the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    night. He didn't see any indication she was going to wake up, and all he could hear was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her regular, rhythmic breathing. Her face was beautiful as always, but seeing it so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cherubic in sleep was making Amane's heart jump in his chest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He courteously tucked her in, then crouched down beside the bed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …It's too much.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Having a girl sleeping in his bed, remembering the soft feeling of her body against his,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seeing her adorable and defenseless sleeping face, then realizing just how much she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    must trust him to fall asleep in his apartment—that and a million other things were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    running through his mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, he was grateful she believed in him, but at the same time, he couldn't help<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but think that she only saw him as a safe and hopeless nuisance, a harmless little boy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane glanced over at her and noted the tranquil expression on her sleeping face. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was utterly oblivious to his inner turmoil.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She has no idea how I feel.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    And she's let down her guard too much.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …I could climb into that bed right now if I wanted to…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The thought lasted only a moment before he pushed it out of his mind. Of course it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would be wrong, on so many levels. And he knew that the moment Mahiru woke up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and discovered them sleeping together, she would never talk to him ever again. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shuddered at the thought of her soft eyes turning cold and scornful.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That is definitely a bad idea.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But maybe, instead of that, if… just a little... would be okay, wouldn't it?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He extended a hand toward Mahiru's head.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Smooth, sleek, glossy—those were the words that came to mind as he slid his fingers<p></p>
    <p></p>
    over her long, soft, vibrant hair without hitting a single snag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She must work hard to keep it like this, huh…?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Feeling both admiration and a shudder of fear at the enormous efforts demanded by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    femininity, Amane let his fingertips glide slowly across Mahiru's cheek. Her porcelain<p></p>
    <p></p>
    skin was surprisingly cool, at least compared to Amane's fingers. When the brief<p></p>
    <p></p>
    caress was over, Amane looked down and saw that a slight smile had graced Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tranquil face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good night."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'm sure she'll be surprised when she wakes up in the morning tomorrow… or actually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    today, I guess. Considering what he had just gone through, he figured that she could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    live with a little surprise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I really am hopeless…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane flashed a troubled smile, then gently reached out to stroke Mahiru's soft cheek<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one more time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    17 The Defenseless Angel and the Start of the New Year<p></p>
    When Amane awoke in the morning, all was quiet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He could hear the cries of birds outside, but there was no sign from his bedroom that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was up yet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was already past dawn, but maybe because she was exhausted from the night before,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed to still be sleeping soundly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had only managed to get some brief shut-eye—the persistent thought of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru in his bed made true rest elusive—and he had ended up drifting off, lingering<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the edge of sleep until deciding to get up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The restless night wasn't particularly taxing on him physically, so that was fine, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the whole situation was trying in another way. This was the first time he had ever let<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a girl stay over at his place, never mind having one sleep in his bed. Naturally, he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    incredibly anxious.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …I mean, what am I even supposed to do in a situation like this?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was pretty sure that Mahiru had only allowed herself to fall asleep because she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    considered him a safe and harmless guy, but Amane was a guy nonetheless, a fact that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he wished she would acknowledge more often.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He really regretted not waking her and sending her back home, but it was no use now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sighed and stretched to work out the knots in his body after spending the night<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the sofa, then stood up slowly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For the time being, he thought he would look in on Mahiru. Well, his main goal was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    actually to grab a change of clothes, but he decided to check on her while he was in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Ever so slowly, he opened the bedroom door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Inside, it was quiet. Mahiru was just as he had left her, still sleeping in his bed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If there had been any change, it was that she must have turned over several times in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her sleep, because now she was lying on her side, and her hair was spread across the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sheets like a flowing river of gold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane knelt down to look at Mahiru more closely. Her sleeping breaths were even and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    serene.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She looks so innocent when she's asleep.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru often wore a calm expression, perhaps because she usually had her guard up,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but… her sleeping face was the picture of tranquility. Again, he felt the urge to reach<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out and pet her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …She really is cute like this…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, she was undeniably beautiful any time of day, but seeing her in such a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    vulnerable state plucked at Amane's heartstrings in a very different way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He wanted to stroke her smooth hair and poke at her soft cheeks.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was usually so proper and reserved, with no gaps or cracks in her facade, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    catching her in a defenseless state like this made him want to mess with her a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without putting any thought into the matter, Amane stretched a hand out toward her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and pressed the tip of his finger against her cheek, which looked so soft. Mahiru's skin<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was as silky as it had been the night before. He almost wanted to go on touching her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forever. In the back of his mind, he knew he needed to be delicate, but the softness of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her skin was spellbinding and made him want to dote on her…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, who had been sleeping quietly, suddenly let out a hoarse but endearing groan<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and looked at Amane with bleary, caramel-coloured eyes… or at least, she seemed to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look in Amane's direction. He thought that her cherubic face appeared even more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    innocent in repose. She stared absently for a moment, eyes blank and cloudy with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sleep, and then frowned and settled back down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane started to pull his hand away, Mahiru stirred, and her cheek brushed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    against his fingers again. "…Nn…" A dainty sigh rose in her throat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    To Amane, it almost seemed like she was saying Don't go.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, Mahiru was obviously still half asleep. She would definitely never act like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this under any normal circumstances.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even so, Amane thought that her movements reminded him of an affectionate kitten.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The day had only just begun, and already his brain was failing him. He couldn't decide<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whether to pull back or keep caressing her cheek. Despite all sense and reason, his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heart was really leaning toward the latter. After all, he rarely got to see Mahiru this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unguarded, and he wanted to see how much he could get away with.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But Amane knew that if Mahiru caught him acting on his desire, she wouldn't listen to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a word he had to say. He knew without a doubt that this would all make her incredibly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    uncomfortable, so he stopped short.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed to be coming around slowly, but she was obviously not awake just yet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She hadn't moved, and her cheek was still pressed against Amane's fingers.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had come into the room looking to check on her and maybe grab a change of clothes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while he was at it. How had he ended up doing something like this? Amane felt his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cheeks grow hot as it fully dawned on him just how unspeakably creepy he was acting.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nn-ngh…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After another moment, Mahiru's eyelids finally started to flutter open again…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Ah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They locked eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's gaze flicked from Amane, who was leaning over her, to his extended finger.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She immediately sat bolt upright.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "M-morning," Amane stammered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…G-good morning…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You fell asleep at my place, so I let you stay the night here, but I didn't have any ulterior<p></p>
    <p></p>
    motives and I swear I didn't do anything, so really, I hope you can appreciate all that…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane said, the words pouring out in a rush as he struggled to explain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As she listened to Amane's jumbled account, Mahiru stayed quiet, but her cheeks<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quickly flushed bright red as it dawned on her where she had slept, and she tugged at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a corner of the futon, practically hiding herself with it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Finding even that small gesture charming, Amane quickly turned away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What is happening here?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though he had lent her a bed for the night, he was starting to feel bad. He knew<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he had been wrong to touch her without permission. But it had only been for a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    moment, and he had absolutely no intention of taking it any further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane looked back at Mahiru. His heart was pounding in his chest. He didn't know if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it was because he was smitten with her or from feeling guilty. He saw that her cheeks<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were still tinged red, and she was staring at him with a sullen look… or not quite sullen.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It seemed like she had something to say to him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Amane, do you like touching my cheeks?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, you touched me at Christmas and then again yesterday when I fell asleep,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…So you were awake the whole time?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The other night, when he had stroked her cheek… he'd thought that she'd been fast<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asleep. That she would never know he'd touched her. But she did, because she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    actually been awake at the time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you see, I briefly woke up just as I was being lowered into bed… Moreover, how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could I do anything else in a situation like that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Weren't you worried about me… doing something?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I never thought you would do anything like that, but… in order to confirm my<p></p>
    <p></p>
    suspicions, I pretended to be asleep."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, falling asleep in front of him had been some kind of test to determine<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whether he was really worthy of her trust. Ultimately, it seemed like she was leaning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    toward yes rather than no, for which he was glad.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hoped she wouldn't test that out again. He really wasn't sure he would do any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    better the next time he was faced with controlling himself when she was that same<p></p>
    <p></p>
    charming vulnerability, either.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, I'm glad you haven't decided I'm totally shady. Also please don't try any more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tests. I am a man, after all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, I kn-know that, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Or maybe you were expecting me to try something?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course not!" Mahiru firmly denied, pulling the comforter back up around her. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was practically shaking, and Amane thought he'd seen her start to blush, just a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He wisely swallowed the urge to make a joke about her being in his bed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For now, it was probably a good idea to give Mahiru some space until she regained her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    composure.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After that inexplicable bout of awkwardness, Mahiru returned to her apartment to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    freshen up before coming back again. But it was obvious that she was still embarrassed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because she refused to make eye contact with Amane. Every time he tried to catch her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gaze, she turned away. Even though she was sitting on the sofa right next to him, it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like she was miles away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Please forgive me," Amane said, stomach twisting in knots.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru quickly glanced over at him, then sighed softly. Maybe she wasn't as upset<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anymore; she was wearing her usual serene expression. "I'm not angry. You don't have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to apologize, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I think—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose I'm mostly upset with myself for being so careless, that's all. I really wish<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you hadn't seen me like that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Like… what? I thought you looked really sweet…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's dreaming face had reminded him why people called her an angel, but more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    importantly, he had discovered that just after she woke up, in the moments between<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sleep and wakefulness, her usual cool and collected demeanor gave way to a youthful<p></p>
    <p></p>
    innocence that he found extremely charming.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If anything, Amane wanted to see her like that again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But it was clear that Mahiru was not happy that he'd seen her with her guard down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Before Amane could argue any further, she bit her lip hard and suddenly whacked him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with a pillow. It didn't hurt or anything—it was obvious that Mahiru wasn't really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    trying—but it caught Amane by surprise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What the heck?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You know, I hate that about you, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hate what? At least tell me what I did wrong."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What you said… That's not the sort of thing that you can just say to a girl so casually,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well it's not like I would say that sort of thing to anyone else…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The only girls Amane knew were Mahiru and Chitose. And sure, Chitose was cute, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane found her more annoying than anything else, and there was no need for him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to praise her to her face anyway. So who else would he even talk to like that?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could see that Mahiru was feeling defensive. He watched her reactions carefully<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as he continued. "Besides, you must be used to people saying those kinds of things<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about you, right?" He shrugged. "Why should it bother you now?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After all, he had told Mahiru many times that he thought she was cute. It didn't seem<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like the kind of thing that would suddenly become a sticking point. She knew how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    beautiful she was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She can't be that embarrassed just because of a little compliment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That's what Amane thought, but for some reason, Mahiru was still wearing a sour face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Seriously, what's the matter?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She landed one final attack by whacking him again with the cushion, then Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turned away sharply and said "I'm going to go make mochi soup" before putting on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her apron and heading for the kitchen.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't do anything but squeeze the cushion and stare at Mahiru's back as she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    abruptly stalked out of the room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    By the time they finished eating the mochi soup, Mahiru was back to her usual self.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The start of the meal had been rather uncomfortable, but both the soup and the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    assorted osechi dishes were so delicious that Amane had quickly forgotten everything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    else, and before he realized it, Mahiru's spirits had recovered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As they moved from the table back to sitting together on the sofa, Amane asked, "By<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the way, are you planning to go for a shrine visit to start off the New Year, Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shrine visit? I wasn't really planning to go… I don't like crowds, you know. People<p></p>
    <p></p>
    always stare at me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's because you're…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had been about to say "…because you're so beautiful," but the mood had only just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    recovered after his earlier faux pas, so he swallowed the words and only said "Well, I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    guess there's not a ton you can do about that" instead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you going to go to one, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I always went with my parents when I was back home, but I was just wondering<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whether I should go. I was thinking that it might be best to pass, at least on New Year's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Day."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Agreed."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Chitose and Itsuki are having a cozy time at her place, so they're not around, and kids<p></p>
    <p></p>
    these days don't make a big deal out of the first shrine visit of the year anyway, you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    know? I think we can put it off."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Compared to the old days… for young people, especially those in their teens and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    twenties, first-day-of-the-year shrine visits were getting less and less popular. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and Mahiru wouldn't be especially strange for skipping out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't exactly that he didn't want to go, but he knew that there would be too many<p></p>
    <p></p>
    people to be able to move comfortably and that the experience would just end up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    being exhausting, so he was thinking it would probably be better to go after the crowds<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thinned out a bit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Besides," Amane continued, "I want to spend the first three days of the New Year<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relaxing. I don't really care about holiday bargains or anything, either."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Actually, I am sort of interested in the special blind bags some stores have," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mentioned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you going to a shopping mall or somewhere?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She shook her head. "…I'm not brave enough to charge into those crowds."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Agreed."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane replied in the same way Mahiru had a moment ago and leaned back into the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sofa.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was definitely no need to go anywhere just because it was New Year's Day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was perfectly content taking it easy at home. He preferred to avoid stressful<p></p>
    <p></p>
    situations, after all. And since they'd be spending the holiday together, he certainly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wouldn't want for food or conversation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thinking to himself what a luxurious New Year's holiday this was turning out to be,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane stole a glance at Mahiru sitting beside him as a small smile crept onto his face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    18 : Visiting Parents and the First Shrine Visit of the Year<p></p>
    e stole a glance at Mahiru sitting beside him as a small smile crept onto his face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Can we visit your apartment tomorrow, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's father, Shuuto, sent that message at ten o'clock in the evening on January 3—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    after dinner and after Mahiru had gone home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's all right that you didn't come home for the holiday, but I do want to see you. Besides,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I heard about her from your mother, but I think I'd better say hello to your neighbor<p></p>
    <p></p>
    myself."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His father probably wanted to meet the person taking such good care of his son. And<p></p>
    <p></p>
    since Amane's mother had already discovered his relationship with Mahiru, and was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    actually in regular contact with her, Amane didn't see much point in refusing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He no longer had anything to hide, and he didn't want to turn his parents away after<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not visiting for the holidays. Plus, Amane figured that the presence of his father should<p></p>
    <p></p>
    help keep his mother in check and prevent her from making a big scene. If nothing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    else, Amane was counting on him to help him avoid a repeat of her last exhausting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    visit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Besides, Amane had a feeling that even if he did refuse his parents, his mother would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    come over to see Mahiru anyway, so after setting up a time with his father (who had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been courteous enough to ask in advance) Amane sent Mahiru a heads-up message.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um, well, is it all right for me to be there during your family time? Won't I be intruding?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The next day, Mahiru came over to Amane's apartment early. She seemed nervous.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was only to be expected, in a way. Mahiru had been taking care of him… though<p></p>
    <p></p>
    phrasing it that way sounded a bit misleading… In any case, Mahiru had been spending<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a lot of time with him, and now his parents wanted to meet her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was already used to talking with his mother, or at least being talked at by his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mother, but Amane's father would be joining this time. It was no surprise that she was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nervous.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, now that Dad is coming to say hello, and since Mom has taken such a liking to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you, I'd appreciate it if you were here. Really, I need you here."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-you say that, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm sure you would rather avoid it, but it'd really mean a lot to me if you'd put up with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it just for a little while."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was somewhat surreal to be introducing her to his parents, but they'd requested,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and now there was no way around it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He felt bad for taking up Mahiru's time, but he knew that his father was the type of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    person who likely wouldn't rest until he'd met her, so he hoped she wouldn't mind it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too much.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I wonder what Shihoko has told him about me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Relax. I made sure to tell my dad that you are someone who helps me out a lot. Even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    if he gets the wrong idea, I've already told him that my mother's crazy ideas about you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    are not at all true."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's mother seemed to have already decided that Mahiru was his bride-to-be and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her very own future daughter-in-law. Amane had made sure to firmly deny everything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    coming out of her mouth. His father had laughed and said, "Shihoko has always had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the bad habit of letting her imagination run wild." So apparently, he understood the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    situation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed relieved to hear that, and Amane smiled wryly as they waited. "Sorry<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about this."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Then, with perfect timing, the intercom rang.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His parents had already gotten past the lobby with their duplicate key, so he expected<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that they had come directly to his door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At the sound of the chime, Mahiru shuddered in surprise, so Amane shot her a small<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smile to put her at ease and headed for the door. He took the chain off and unfastened<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the lock.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he opened the door, there stood his parents, just as he remembered them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's been half a year, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Long time no see, Dad."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane greeted Shuuto's amicable smile with a slightly relieved grin of his own.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With his gentle demeanor, Shuuto was the type of person who somehow calmed things<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down just by being around. Amane relaxed a little simply seeing him there.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You didn't seem nearly as happy to see your mother…," Shihoko said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's because my mother forced her way in without so much as a warning. If you'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ever give me any notice, I would react normally."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The last time Shihoko had shown up, Mahiru had been at his place, and he'd tried to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turn her away. If he'd been alone, he probably would have treated her a little nicer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well anyway, come on in," Amane added. "What's with the package?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, we brought you all sorts of things. But we can look at that later. Where's Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Inside," Amane answered succinctly. After his parents had removed their shoes, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    led them into the living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed anxious as she looked over at them and blinked, wide-eyed, in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    understandable surprise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's father looked remarkably young. He didn't seem to be much past thirty,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    especially if you forgot that he had a teenage son, and had a youthful, handsome face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    More than once, Amane had wished that he took more after his father, whose tender<p></p>
    <p></p>
    features made him seem like a well-mannered young man (though in actuality, he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    middle-aged). When the two of them walked side by side, they looked more like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    distant brothers than father and son.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru dear, it's been too long," Shihoko said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "'Too long'? It's only been a month!" Amane remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I think that counts." Shihoko approached Mahiru wearing a beaming smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru stood straighter and greeted her with a formal "How good to see you again,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wearing the faint smile that was an integral part of her public persona.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But her bewildered eyes were still straying toward Amane's father, standing next to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko. Shuuto smiled warmly when he noticed Mahiru looking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nice to meet you. I'm Amane's father, Shuuto Fujimiya. I've heard about you from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko, Miss Shiina. Thank you for taking such good care of our son."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nice to meet you. I'm Mahiru Shiina. And I appreciate everything Amane does for me<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as well."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shuuto bowed politely, and Mahiru introduced herself courteously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had probably been worried that Amane's father would be a lot like his mother,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but Shuuto was a mild-mannered man with a good head on his shoulders, and he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doing his best to put Mahiru at ease.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shuuto was generally the one who reined in Shihoko's wilder tendencies. Really, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was the only person she would listen to, which proved just how much she loved him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Goodness, you don't have to be so modest!" Shihoko interrupted. "Amane is a slob,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    after all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Geez, sorry I don't meet your standards…," Amane muttered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come now, Shihoko, don't say things like that," his father said. "…And, Amane, this girl<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is taking care of you day in, day out, so I'm sure you're showing her the appropriate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gratitude and appreciation, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "As best I can."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's what I like to hear."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shuuto, who had raised Amane to treasure women, had apparently been worried over<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whether his son was being considerate enough. Of course Amane would have found it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unbearable to kick back while Mahiru did everything, so he did whatever he could for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shuuto seemed reassured by Amane's answer and turned his gaze toward Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Truly, I must offer you my thanks. I hear you've been fixing my son's meals every<p></p>
    <p></p>
    day, and you were even kind enough to make osechi dishes for the holiday…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm always thanking her for that. I've been trying to show my appreciation every<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chance I get, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's true…" Mahiru nodded. "Amane's surprisingly considerate."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Surprisingly?" Amane asked. "And what's so surprising about it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Th-that is, I—I mean…," Mahiru stammered. "You seemed… a bit neglectful at first<p></p>
    <p></p>
    glance, but it turns out you actually pay rather close attention."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane found himself at a loss for words, unable to refute anything she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The most important thing is that the two of you are getting along well," Shuuto said<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with a gentle smile. "Amane, make sure you're not being too much of a bother to Miss<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shiina."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I know that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And, Miss Shiina, I'd like you to speak up right away if Amane gives you any trouble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    My son might not seem like it, but he's really quite an earnest young man, so I believe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he'll do his best to smooth over any… rough patches."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane is a nice guy. I can't think of anything rough about him… well, maybe just a tiny<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bit…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "He's not exactly the smoothest, eh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No… he's not really disagreeable… more like, he's just a little hopeless."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was fidgeting as if she was having a hard time saying what was on her mind. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    made Amane want to cross-examine her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What exactly is so hopeless that you had to say it like that?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For some reason that Amane didn't understand, Shihoko seemed to grasp what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru getting at. She looked over at him with a broad grin. "Ah-haah!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't do much more than glare at his mother in irritation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here you are."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's parents were guests in his apartment, so it was only natural to treat them as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    such. However, Mahiru had insisted on being the one to set out the tea, so Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    left it in her capable hands.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had brought her tea set over to his apartment so she could use it whenever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she visited. Amane had never imagined it would be used for this, though.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Both of his parents were wearing warm smiles, seated on the sofa where Amane and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru usually sat together.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My goodness, thank you, Mahiru dear. You're quite skilled at hosting visitors, aren't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Though, really, that should be Amane's job, you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was doing it because when Amane tried brewing tea, it usually turned out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much too bitter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Still, Shihoko looked somewhat aghast.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I wanted to do it, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I suppose that's fine, since Amane never gets the water temperature right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother was absolutely correct, but it made him a little irritated that she pointed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it out so blatantly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, he couldn't deny the truth, so he stoically kept his mouth shut as Shihoko<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turned to him and smiled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come to think of it, Amane, you've finally started calling sweetie Mahiru by her first<p></p>
    <p></p>
    name, haven't you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At this sudden observation, both Amane and Mahiru froze.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They had grown so comfortable talking to each other that they hadn't noticed, but last<p></p>
    <p></p>
    time they had seen Amane's mother, the two of them had still been addressing each<p></p>
    <p></p>
    other quite formally.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What's it matter?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I think it's great!" His mother beamed. "It's nice that you're getting more intimate."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without pressing the issue any further, Shihoko just sat and beamed at them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could feel his cheek begin to twitch. He almost wished she would just make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fun of him. It would have been easier than dealing with his mother's wild assumptions<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and fabricated narratives.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shihoko dear, don't tease Amane so much," Amane's father interjected. "It's a bad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    habit of yours," he added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, honey. You know I just can't help myself." Amane's mother capitulated to his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    father without much resistance, a fact for which their long-suffering son was acutely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grateful. "But it's wonderful, isn't it? To see our son getting on so well with a cute girl?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm more concerned about whether you might get carried away again, Shihoko darling."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "When that happens, you'll step in for me, won't you, Shuuto darling?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "On some level, I wish you'd work on it if you're already aware it's an issue… but that's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    also part of what makes you the woman I fell in love with, so I suppose there's no<p></p>
    <p></p>
    helping it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ho-ho… what a sly fox you are."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though he was glad Shihoko had eased up on him, Amane couldn't help but sigh<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as his parents drifted off into their own little world.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His father was fundamentally a sensible man, but he had the unfortunate habit of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doting on his treasured wife, which sometimes made it a little awkward for anyone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    else stuck in the same room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Fortunately, they only did this in front of family and didn't act so embarrassingly in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    public. On the other hand, this was supposed to be Amane's apartment, and he wished<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they would show a little more restraint. He was glad that his parents still had a strong<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relationship after so many years together, but they could have been more considerate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about their public displays of affection.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whenever they got like this, Amane didn't like to force himself in between them, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    simply sat down in the chair he had brought over from the dining room and sighed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    deeply again in resignation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru also took a seat in the chair he had set up next to his, and asked Amane quietly,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Your parents get along very well, don't they?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure do. I mean, they're not like that outside, but that's definitely how they are at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    home."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I see," Mahiru answered with a peculiar smile, then looked over at Shihoko and Shuuto.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She didn't seem uncomfortable at all—just the opposite, in fact. Mahiru looked like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was staring at something dazzling and priceless. Amane thought he saw a touch<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of envy in her gaze as she smiled so faintly that the word fleeting didn't do it justice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without thinking, Amane extended a hand toward hers—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, Amane, what is it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He immediately withdrew his hand as the sound of Shihoko's voice pulled him back to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his senses.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't ask me. You and Dad went off into your own world. The two of us could barely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stand to look at you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, are you jealous?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not a chance. I was just thinking that you should get a room. In the privacy of your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    own home, preferably."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother didn't seem to have noticed that he had been on the verge of grabbing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's hand. Mahiru also seemed not to have noticed and forced a smile at Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    words.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He didn't understand why he had instinctually reached out toward her. For some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reason… he had felt like he couldn't bear the thought of leaving Mahiru all alone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was already back to her usual self, so Amane felt slightly relieved and put on his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    usual surly expression so that no one would be any the wiser.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So are you satisfied now, having seen your son's face?" Amane demanded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm more satisfied seeing sweet Mahiru than you, Amane…" His mother leered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm only joking. We still haven't accomplished our real mission yet, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your real what now…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had assumed that they had come over to simply exchange New Year's greetings<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and meet Mahiru, but his mother seemed to have some other goal in mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You and Mahiru haven't been on your first shrine visit of the year yet, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We were planning to go after the crowds die down."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I knew it! And you haven't been yet, either, right, Mahiru? I asked in my message."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Right." Mahiru nodded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I thought that would be the case, so we brought kimonos!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, his mother wanted to go on a shrine visit with Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko was wearing a wide grin as Amane finally realized the reason why she had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brought such a large bag with her. He sighed again. He'd lost count of how many times<p></p>
    <p></p>
    today.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko loved cute things, and she loved playing dress-up, so she'd probably been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    waiting for a chance like this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane also recalled that his mother had a large number of kimonos at home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, she had brought some with her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I've always dreamed of putting a kimono on a daughter and going on a shrine visit<p></p>
    <p></p>
    together… Oh, I'm sure this one will suit you, Mahiru."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mom, you just want a dress-up doll."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not true! But I really do want to dress up Mahiru. Look, this one would suit her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so well!" Shihoko was full of confidence, and her opinion was correct, insofar as there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were hardly any clothes that wouldn't suit Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had seen her in everything from boyish outfits to fancy getups on top of her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    usual girly outfits that featured plenty of frills and lace. As far as he could remember,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    each and every style seemed to suit Mahiru just fine. Apparently, beautiful people<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't need to be choosy about what they wore. It was not hard to imagine that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    traditional Japanese clothes would really suit her as well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was an only child, so his mother was obviously not going to pass up this chance<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to dress up the daughter of her dreams.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, if Mahiru says it's all right, how about you dress her up and go?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why are you talking like you're not coming, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can't; it'll be trouble if I go out with Mahiru and people from school see us together."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If it was only his parents and Mahiru, they would just look like any other family going<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on a shrine visit, so it wouldn't rouse any suspicions, but if Amane joined them, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone from their class spotted him at the shrine with Mahiru, well, he imagined<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that the start of the winter semester would turn into something out of a nightmare.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No shrine visit was worth that risk.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So it'll be all right as long as no one finds out?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose, but I'm pretty sure it'd be really… Uh, wait. I don't like where this is going,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mom…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Heh-heh! I came prepared for situations just like this!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What situations?!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had thought that she'd brought an awful lot of luggage for only kimonos and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    underclothes and accessories. Apparently, she had brought even more stuff so she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could play dress-up with Amane as well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your father is also very excited, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Dad…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We don't get to go out together very often," Amane's father said, "and it is our family's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tradition, after all, so I'd like us to all go together."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he put it that way, it was difficult to refuse.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's father cared a great deal about family traditions. He would feel bad for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    refusing to go along after both his parents made it clear how much they wanted it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But look—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine, dear. You just let your mother take care of it. I'll make you look like a stylish<p></p>
    <p></p>
    young man. I promise you won't even resemble the old Amane!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Isn't that basically the same as saying I'm not stylish now?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course, you've got good features because you take after your father, but your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    haircut and clothes are so unfashionable. I'd say you look gloomy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I didn't ask."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was painfully aware of his drab appearance, but he looked like this because he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    liked to, so he didn't appreciate the criticism.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You'd think that someone so handsome would have an easy time looking cool, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you're a troublesome case, Amane…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's none of your business."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's such a waste… right, Mahiru dear? Wouldn't you like to see Amane all tidied up?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As the conversation suddenly shifted to her, Mahiru became visibly flustered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wished that his mother wouldn't prod at Mahiru so aggressively, but she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    continued needling the poor girl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Once Amane is all dressed up, I think you'll see him in a whole new light, too, Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He may not look it, but Amane's got a fairly handsome face, you know?
    <p></p>
    Personality wise, he's got some work to do, but he does resemble Shuuto, and he knows how to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a gentleman, so if you train him well, I think he could turn out quite nice."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, um… I… suppose so…?" Mahiru stammered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And don't you want to go on the first shrine visit of the year together?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "W-well I… um… I do want to go, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, how could you double-cross me like that?" Amane whined.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd been counting on her to consider what might happen in the worst-case scenario<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and reject his parents' proposal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru glanced at the beleaguered Amane. "…If Amane doesn't want to, it's fine," she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    said in a quiet, slightly discouraged voice, frowning.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane choked. She was trying to hide it, but he could tell that Mahiru was disappointed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't anything dramatic; just a subtle change in her expression. Looking at her long<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eyelashes fluttering over her downcast eyes, Amane felt a powerful knot of guilt<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tighten in his chest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother shot him a look of condemnation, as if to say You made sweet Mahiru sad!<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and his father wore an expression that said It would be easier to fold here.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane groaned quietly and simply said, "…All right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Mahiru made a face like that, there was nothing to do but give in.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay, you're all set."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko had been tinkering wildly with Amane's hair and clothes, until he was quite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exhausted by the time he was finally set free.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It had been pure agony for him, who wasn't much interested in clothes, but when he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    checked himself in the mirror, he could see that his suffering had been worth it. Staring<p></p>
    <p></p>
    back at him was a handsome young man, completely unlike the usual Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The outfit Shihoko had chosen for him was a dark-gray Chesterfield coat over a white<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turtleneck, paired with black slacks—clean and casual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since this was supposed to be an auspicious New Year's event, she had apparently<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought it was critical that he dress up a little. Amane usually didn't like especially<p></p>
    <p></p>
    colorful clothing, so this subdued, monochrome arrangement pleased him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He checked his hairstyle, too, and saw that his mother's skill with a flat iron and some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    styling wax had really worked wonders with his long bangs. His eyes had emerged<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from their usual hiding spot behind his hair, and the impression he gave off was much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brighter now that you could actually see his whole face. The extra volume in his hair<p></p>
    <p></p>
    plus the excellent styling made him look more dignified and refined as well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The person in the mirror wasn't the Amane who got teased by his mother and Itsuki<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for being gloomy, but a bright young man who Amane had never seen before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can turn into such a good-looking young man with just a little work, so I wonder<p></p>
    <p></p>
    why you don't do it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Because I don't want to."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can really be such a grouch sometimes. Your face is usually dour, so unless you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smile, you won't look good, you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Being called dour stung, but Amane couldn't argue with the facts.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, I'm going to go put the finishing touches on Mahiru, so you go wait in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    living room."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been busy in his room, so he didn't have any idea how Mahiru was getting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on. She had gone back to her apartment to dress herself, presumably to quite a high<p></p>
    <p></p>
    standard.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He watched his mother leave the room, then looked himself over in the mirror again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hadn't gotten dressed up like this in a long time, so he didn't resemble himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, I guess it's not bad."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was sure he'd still look shabby standing next to Mahiru, but this was a big<p></p>
    <p></p>
    improvement.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Playing with his bangs a little, now that they weren't hanging in front of his eyes,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane muttered under his breath that sprucing himself up like this from time to time<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably wouldn't be a bad thing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After waiting in the living room with his father for the better part of an hour, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heard the front door open.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had heard that women's preparations could take quite a lot of time and effort, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he hadn't been particularly unhappy with the wait itself, but he was still a bit worried<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about leaving Mahiru alone and whether his mother might have crossed any lines.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Finally, thought Amane as he stood up from the sofa and looked toward the entryway,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just as Mahiru quietly arrived in the living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The moment he laid eyes on her, he was stunned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't normally wear traditional Japanese clothing, so he had never had the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chance to see her in it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had thought for sure that a kimono would look good on her, but—he hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expected this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    According to his mother, it would be difficult to move through a crowd in a long-sleeved
    <p></p>
    kimono, so she had chosen something shorter. With its light-pink color and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    small, repeating pattern of plum blossoms, the kimono suited Mahiru so well that it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was hard to believe it didn't actually belong to her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't normally wear much pink, but it gave her an air of refinement and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    femininity.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her light-colored hair had been left out in long bangs on the sides, and the rest had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been gathered into a bun and decorated with a kanzashi hair clip. Swaying across the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pure-white nape of her neck, the accessory accentuated the girlishness of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ensemble and gave her a distinctly feminine allure.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The elegant outfit, coupled with makeup that had been judiciously applied to enhance<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her natural good looks, elevated Mahiru to the pinnacle of grace and beauty.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So?" Amane's mother beamed. "I think we made her look very cute. Sweet Mahiru is<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so lovely to begin with, and dolling her up really had quite the effect."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, it certainly suits her, dear," his father quickly agreed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had her eyes cast downward, looking rather embarrassed by all the praise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even that movement had something alluring about it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Beauty can really be terrifying.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, Amane, say something."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I think it looks good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was obviously no way he could possibly say what he really thought, especially<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not right there in front of his parents, so Amane kept his praise safely subdued.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother looked extremely dissatisfied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…That won't do at all!" she insisted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, be quiet." Amane turned away. He was not going to engage with his mother any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko gave an exasperated sigh at her son's behavior, but perhaps because she knew<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him quite well, she seemed to agree to let it go.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good grief. Anyway, Mahiru darling, what do you think? Amane looks like a whole<p></p>
    <p></p>
    new person, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yes. This is completely different…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And to think even though he would be so popular if he put in the effort to look like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this all the time, he doesn't ever bother. Really, he's only harming himself."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought this was none of her business, but his mother sighed heavily again, as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    if she truly regretted the loss of potential.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm so disappointed in Amane—he has the good fortune to take after his father, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    yet he doesn't even try to put it to good use. What a waste!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come now, Shihoko," his father said gently. "Amane's growing up in his own way."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If he's growing up, then shouldn't he want to be popular?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If I had to guess, I'd say Amane is the type who is perfectly fine spending time with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just one other person rather than bothering with a crowd."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I guess."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's father had tried to stall Shihoko, but that only fueled her wildest delusions.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was true Amane preferred to hang out one-on-one rather than tag along in a big<p></p>
    <p></p>
    group… Apparently, that was something he had gotten from his father, and he really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    did think it was best, but if he said as much, especially now, it would sound like he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    saying the person he preferred most was Mahiru…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother's radiant smile turned into a grimace, and she turned away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wondered why he had to put up with her unfair cynicism, but as a practical<p></p>
    <p></p>
    matter, he was well aware that other people looked at him the same way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At the very least, Amane could say that Mahiru was a special case. That was the truth,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He snuck a glance at Mahiru, quickly, so she wouldn't notice, and sighed softly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I guess I do like her, in a sense, he thought. I mean, what's not to like about her?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, that was quite a different matter than declaring feelings of love.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mom, there is absolutely nothing going on, I'm telling you. So how about you stop it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with the crazy accusations and go get the car ready."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What an ungrateful child you are… really! Well, all right, I suppose. Shuuto, let's go<p></p>
    <p></p>
    prepare the car, shall we?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sounds like a plan."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had apparently succeeded in changing the subject, as both parents left to make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ready for their departure.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was leaving it up to his parents to decide which shrine they were going to, and he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    watched their backs as they left his apartment to head for the parking lot.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I've got the essentials in my bag, so I don't need much getting ready. How about you,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Everything I need is in this handbag, so I'm ready, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Gotcha."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They were suddenly alone again, so with a slightly anxious feeling, Amane locked up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the windows and unplugged nonessential appliances from the walls.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once he had turned off the living room lights, he looked at Mahiru again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As always, it was immediately apparent she was a beauty. He doubted whether there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was another girl in the world who looked as good in a kimono.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hadn't been comfortable praising her in front of his parents, but Amane was sure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that anyone who saw her would agree that Mahiru was particularly beautiful in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    traditional Japanese dress.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is something the matter, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, no, I was just thinking it really suits you. You look like an old-fashioned beauty<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from a painting or something. The outfit's cute, and I think you're really lovely."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had learned from his father that when a girl was smartly dressed, compliments<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were in order, so he knew he should have praised her look the moment he saw her, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had been too embarrassed to do it in front of his parents.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once Amane had voiced his honest appraisal, Mahiru dramatically blinked several<p></p>
    <p></p>
    times, then blushed and pursed her lips tightly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recalling the last time she had reacted like that, Amane smiled bitterly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, you don't like being complimented, right? Sorry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Th-that's not it, but… Amane, you're fairly—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fairly what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She abruptly turned away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wondered what was going on with her, but she didn't look like she was going<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to elaborate, so Amane quietly finished closing up the apartment and accompanied<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru to the door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She seemed to have given some thought to the fact that they'd be walking around,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because she was wearing boots instead of the traditional sandals. Her choice of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    footwear blended Japanese and western elements in her outfit, and she looked all the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more adorable for it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru somehow wiggled into her boots, as her hair accessory swung back and forth<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with a rustling sound, and Amane, who had gone out first to hold the door, found<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself suddenly quite close to her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru caught him by surprise when she stood up on her tiptoes and gingerly leaned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even closer to him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thinking that maybe she wanted to tell him something, Amane shut the door and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    locked it, then bent over to lend her his ear. Mahiru cupped her palms around her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mouth and whispered into his ear.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um… You look good, too, you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was all she said before slipping past him and briskly heading for the elevator.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane promptly banged his head against his front door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…That's not fair."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's heart was pounding like an alarm going off in his chest, his face was burning,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and his forehead hurt. Mahiru had set him ablaze in a single breath. This was her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    revenge.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His parents looked at him suspiciously as he hustled to catch up to them in the parking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lot.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When they arrived at a famous shrine located in an area a little less than an hour away,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there weren't as many people as they had seen on television, but the crowds still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed practically endless.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it's thinned out quite a bit, but I'd say there are still plenty here, eh?" Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mother remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There sure are…," Amane agreed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru darling, careful not to stray. We'll keep an eye on you, too, and we all have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smartphones, so I think finding one another would be easy enough. But even so, I want<p></p>
    <p></p>
    us all to visit the shrine together, of course."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Dressed in a kimono, Mahiru had the hardest time moving out of all of them. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    restrictive garment forced her to take small steps and walk slowly. At least she was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wearing boots instead of sandals.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They didn't necessarily have to push their way through the crowd, but it was tight<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough that it was easy to run into people, so they had to proceed with caution.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, shall we get going?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko was leading the way through the crowd, and she headed first for the ablution<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pavilion where they would purify their hands and mouths with water. As expected,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was already attracting attention from many people.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    More than a few people were dressed in kimonos, so Mahiru didn't stand out much for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wearing one… but that wasn't the issue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She drew people's eyes even in her school uniform, when she wasn't dressed up at all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now that she looked like an aristocratic beauty in traditional Japanese clothing, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    obviously garnered a lot of attention. Even her motions as she cleaned her mouth were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    graceful. Practically everyone in the shrine was staring.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Is something the matter?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though Amane was thinking it was all rather interesting, he didn't say as much, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he cleansed his hands and mouth just as his parents had, then followed after them as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they walked on ahead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was doing his best to match pace with Mahiru, but as expected for someone who<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't ordinarily wear Japanese clothes, the long hem was giving her some difficulty,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and the shrine was still quite crowded, so she was progressing much more slowly than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    usual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, are you all right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, this is… Aaah!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was getting bumped around by the other shrine-goers, which kept knocking her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    off-balance and threatened to topple her outright, so Amane extended an arm to assist.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't seem to be all right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course she was uncomfortable walking around in a strange and complicated getup.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Sorry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here, give me your hand."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane reached for one small hand that was peeking out of her kimono sleeve. Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked up at him, and he nearly pulled his hand back, but she quickly pressed her palm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into his, keeping her eyes on him the whole time. He stared right back at her, though<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was not entirely sure why.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru squeezed Amane's hand tightly and looked away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He tilted his head questioningly, and they followed the flow of the crowd for a moment,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    until they were about to arrive in front of the offertory box, so Amane tucked whatever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    small doubts he had away in his heart and focused on the sensation of her hand in his.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You were praying for a really long time; what did you ask for?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once they had finished their visit and moved a distance away from the file of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    worshippers, he posed this question to Mahiru, who had prayed at some length. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had looked like a model going through all the motions of a shrine visit. After ringing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the bell, she had pressed her hands together for nearly twice as long as Amane. He had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been captivated by how elegantly she had offered her prayers, but he also wondered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    what she had to pray for.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good health."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "An incredibly safe choice."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was very typical of Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She didn't want for very much, so Amane had wondered what she might have asked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for, but it was so predictable choice that her answer was kind of anticlimactic.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That, and—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…And to be able to keep spending peaceful days together, just like we have been."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Another very typical petition.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was just the sort of thing that Mahiru, who didn't much care for excitement or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    change, would pray for. It was very fitting, as she prized peace and quiet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We won't get much of that while my mom's around, though."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's something we can enjoy for what it is."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Is it, though…?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't sure, but Mahiru seemed to be enjoying herself, so he didn't argue and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just took Mahiru's hand with a gentle smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They hadn't yet entirely extracted themselves from the crowd, and Amane was sure to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    find himself in trouble if he let Mahiru trip and fall now. He could see his parents<p></p>
    <p></p>
    waiting a short distance away, having already finished their own visit to the shrine.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was why Amane was holding her hand, he told himself. Mahiru's eyelashes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fluttered, and she kept her eyes cast downward, looking embarrassed, but she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    squeezed Amane's hand back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You two, over here!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother's voice was bright and clear, easy to distinguish among the crowd.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Following her words, the two of them headed over to Amane's parents. Shihoko's eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    went wide when she saw them, then she pressed a hand over her smiling mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh my, my!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're just holding hands so naturally."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't until she spelled it out that he realized what a mistake it was to hold Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hand in front of his mother. This was the kind of thing that couples did, wasn't it? He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't appreciate Shihoko's suspicions and hated always being on the receiving end of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her smirking grins.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's obviously so we don't lose sight of each other. Plus, it's easy for her to trip,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wearing a kimono."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "He's right. It's difficult to walk in a kimono, and he's doing the right thing by escorting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her. I do the same thing for you, Shihoko dear," Amane's father agreed. In a single<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smooth motion, he grasped his wife's hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's life would be easier if he were able to take a girl's hand as smoothly as his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    father could, but he knew it was impossible given his personality, so he was secretly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grateful that Mahiru had been frank about taking his hand instead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Feeling relieved that his mother's attention was occupied, Amane tried to gently let go<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of Mahiru's hand, but she wouldn't relax her grip.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He could tell from the way she squeezed that she had no intention of separating, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quietly asked her what was wrong, but there was no answer. Her delicate fingers<p></p>
    <p></p>
    simply held tightly to his.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, Mahiru sweetie, we were thinking of going to buy some hot drinks. Would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you like sweet red bean soup—or sweet sake?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, I'll take red bean soup, please."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother's interruption spoiled any hope of asking Mahiru further questions or of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    getting his hand back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How about you, Amane dear?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…All right, I'll have sweet sake."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Coming right up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As long as Mahiru doesn't hate this, I guess it's fine, right?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane tried to calm the fluttering in his chest as he adjusted his hand in hers.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Before long, Shihoko returned from the concessions stand and handed everyone their<p></p>
    <p></p>
    drinks. At this point, it would have been incredibly awkward for them to continue<p></p>
    <p></p>
    holding hands, so Mahiru let go, and Amane got the chance to catch his breath.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His parents were smiling at each other gently as they enjoyed their sweet sake.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They weren't quite off in their own world, but they were getting flirty, so Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    no desire to speak to them at the moment and instead focused on drinking his own<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sweet sake.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sweet sake like this was said to be so nutritious it was like having an IV drip, and as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the rich sweetness of the fermented rice spread through him, he unintentionally let<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out a sigh that was a mix of astonishment and relief.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't usually care much for sweets, though he did rather like red bean paste,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so he had also been tempted to choose the red bean soup. However, he had gone with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the sake because it felt more appropriate for New Year's, and he was confident that it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had been the right choice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he glanced over at Mahiru, he saw her sipping her sweet red bean soup from a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    paper cup with a calm expression. She made it look absolutely delicious, and suddenly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he regretted his decision.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I wonder if I can get her to give me a sip?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was gazing at her and wondering if he could get some if he asked, when Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    noticed him looking and tilted her head quizzically. Her hair decoration swayed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rhythmically with her graceful movements.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is the sweet red bean soup any good?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's delicious," she said, nodding.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Could I try some?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked startled by his question. It was almost comical how quickly she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    straightened up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, s-sure you can, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She couldn't hide how flustered she was, glancing up at him timidly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you don't want me to, it's fine…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's… it's not that I don't want you to, but… well—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "N-no, nothing, it's fine. Here. Could I have some of your sake, too?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "S-sure."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru quickly seized his cup. She seemed suddenly very agitated for some reason.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane accepted her cup of red bean soup.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In it was a thick liquid that was certainly bean-colored.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he brought the cup to his lips, the unique fragrance of sweet red beans wafted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gently over him and filled his nose as a rich flavor spread over his tongue. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't have much of a sweet tooth, so even the slight sweetness of the bean soup<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed strong to him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was delicious and vividly brought to mind thoughts of how well sweet red bean<p></p>
    <p></p>
    paste paired with bitter green tea.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Mahiru seemed to have a thing for sweets, he thought this soup was probably<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just perfect for her tastes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he glanced over at Mahiru, perhaps because she had sipped the sweet sake, her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cheeks were slightly flushed. She looked almost anxious.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't like it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not it… Amane, you made such a big deal out of sharing a piece of cake. Why<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doesn't this bother you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Ah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was when he realized why Mahiru had reacted the way she did. Amane froze in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    We're not feeding each other, but I guess this is still an indirect kiss, huh?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His attention had been focused on the sweet red bean soup, and he had inadvertently<p></p>
    <p></p>
    suggested that they share an indirect kiss. He may not have realized it, but there could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be no doubt that he had put Mahiru on the spot. That must have been why she had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    acted the way she had.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "S-sorry. That was really thoughtless. I'm sure you hated it…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wh-why are you always like that, Amane? I was just… I was embarrassed, okay? That<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I— I'll be more careful in the future. Sorry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whatever she might have been feeling, it was a fact that he had put her on the spot.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane bowed his head slightly, and Mahiru waved her hand in front of her face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    frantically.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "R-really, I'm not worried about it!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you sure? Well, I'm sorry anyway. I shouldn't treat you the same way as my other<p></p>
    <p></p>
    friends."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki and Chitose were the type of people who didn't care about that stuff and would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    take sips of Amane's drinks and bites of his food and insist it was fine because they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were friends.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki was the same sex as Amane, and Chitose was the opposite sex, but he had never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked at either of them with the slightest romantic interest, so it didn't really feel like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an indirect kiss when they shared food. He just got irritated when they stole his snacks.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But with Mahiru, it was obviously different. He was in the wrong for not realizing that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sooner.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do Itsuki and Chitose usually do things like that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yeah, I mean, we're friends, after all…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is that so?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru nodded, wearing a complex expression that could have been either<p></p>
    <p></p>
    comprehension or consternation. Then she lowered her gaze back down to the sweet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sake and raised the cup to her lips again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I suppose, Amane, that you and I are friends, too, so it's fine."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yeah… but you drank it all, didn't you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's cheeks flushed even though there was no alcohol in the drink. "Th-there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't much left!" She turned away sharply.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In retaliation, Amane gulped down what was left of Mahiru's sweet red bean soup.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd expected it to have gotten cold, but it was somehow still hot and seemed even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sweeter than before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru dear, you're such a good cook!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    By the time they made it back from the shrine visit, it was already evening. Mahiru had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    changed clothes and begun her usual dinner preparations, but… Amane's mother<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko was also in the kitchen, ostensibly to observe Mahiru's culinary skills.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His parents had decided to spend the night. Their house was several hours away by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    car, and they were tired. It sounded like they had been intending to stay over from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    outset. Amane wished that they'd asked the guy living there first, but his father<p></p>
    <p></p>
    technically owned the apartment, so he knew he had no right to complain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Luckily, he had an extra futon set just in case he ever had anyone over, so he figured<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they could share it. They slept in the same bed at home, so it wouldn't be that different.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you very much," Mahiru said graciously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Really, you're very good for a high school girl. When I was your age, there's no way I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could have done all this."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your cooking's no match for Mahiru's now, Mom."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did you say something, dear?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not a thing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A low-pitched voice had come flying out of the kitchen at him, so Amane feigned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    innocence and huddled against the sofa. His father was relaxing on the couch next to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him and chided, "Now, Amane, don't pick on your mother."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But she was always picking on him, so he felt like this was a fair turnabout.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could hear his mother chatting with Mahiru in a cheerful voice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru calmly kept up with her, unfazed by her intense energy and attention. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed to be getting used to the high-strung woman.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Watching from afar, Amane gazed at the two of them preparing dinner and apparently<p></p>
    <p></p>
    getting along well, and he let out a quiet sigh of relief.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your mother seems to have taken quite a liking to Miss Shiina, hasn't she?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's father was gazing at the two of them in the same way, and he looked pleased.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, she's beautiful and sweet and has a nice personality, so I'm not surprised that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mom likes her."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How about you, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Oh, I mean, I think she's a nice person, and I think she's cute."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I see."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It seemed like a casual question, but Amane's father wasn't the type of person to pry<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too much, so he had probably asked out of genuine curiosity. He didn't press Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on his answer any further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm looking forward to trying this food that you enjoy every day, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can vouch for the taste. If Mom doesn't meddle too much, that is."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't need to worry. Shihoko was the one who wanted to eat Miss Shiina's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooking, so I'm sure the most she'll do is help out a little."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's good, if it's true."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother wasn't a bad cook, but most of her dishes featured big, bold flavors, in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    contrast to Mahiru's subtle seasonings. Delicate flavors were his father's specialty<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while his mother favored quantity and ease of preparation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, that was important for a housewife who had a growing boy's appetite to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    satisfy, but Amane actually preferred the carefully calibrated flavors of the dishes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru made. He shuddered to think of anyone meddling with Mahiru's exquisite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seasonings.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thankfully, his mother seemed to be constraining herself to being Mahiru's assistant<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like his father said, so he breathed a sigh of relief and continued watching the two of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    them cook.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh yes, this is very good," Amane's father said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way that the four of them would have fit around Amane's two-person<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dining table, so he had pulled out the large folding desk that had been shut away in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the storage room to use for dinner.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you very much." Mahiru looked relieved at Shuuto's frank assessment, and she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    visibly relaxed a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, she had never let anyone other than Amane eat her home cooking, outside<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of home-ec class in school, of course, and had been somewhat nervous about it… but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at last that stiffness melted away once she saw Shuuto's gentle smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's really delicious," Amane's mother added. "If she can cook like this, she won't have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    any trouble living alone—or getting married."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko muttered quietly to herself while looking at Amane. He could feel his cheek<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about to twitch but forcibly maintained a neutral expression and sipped his miso soup.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The rich, dashi-infused flavor was now very familiar to him. He had really gotten used<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to the way Mahiru prepared her dishes and, after eating her cooking every day, had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    practically lost all desire to eat anything else.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, what do you think?" his mother asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's delicious, of course. Thanks for always cooking, Mahiru."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had been planning to say as much anyway. But now that his mother had prompted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him, it probably sounded like he didn't really mean it. Amane had never forgotten to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tell Mahiru that her cooking was delicious every day when they ate together, but since<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his parents were here, he had been holding back. And that had obviously been the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wrong decision.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His gratitude was no different now, but for some reason, Mahiru was restless, fidgeting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    uncomfortably. "…Sure," she answered in a quiet voice. Her cheeks were flushed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slightly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was probably because his parents were there. There could be no doubt that Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was feeling bashful, even if only a little. She was used to hearing Amane's appraisals<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of her cooking, but now three people had complimented her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're awfully cute, Mahiru."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shihoko, don't tease."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not what I meant! I was just thinking that she's a good, upstanding girl, which<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is so hard to find these days."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Th-that's… It's not really…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I can agree with that. Mahiru's like, really pure, you could say."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane?!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was definitely a little naive. Her face had gone bright red once just from seeing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a guy—a not particularly attractive guy—with the front of his shirt open.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My, my, did something happen between you two while we weren't looking?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nope."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing happened."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The denial practically leaped from Mahiru's mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Being innocent or naive wasn't the worst thing in the world, but Mahiru seemed to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hate being called those things. Amane had no plans to say anything further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I think that they should do just as they please, as long as Amane isn't hurting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Miss Shiina, that is," Amane's father said. "Just don't tease her too much, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know that much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, weren't you just teasing her?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, it was an accurate description—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt something strike his thigh below the table. Mahiru's face was bright red,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and she was glaring in his direction.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry, sorry," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A sullen expression crossed her handsome features. But that only made her look even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more adorable, and Amane couldn't help but grin. He only hoped that Mahiru wouldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stay mad at him for long.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You know, I can't help but feel a bit like we're looking in the mirror. What do you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    think, Shihoko darling?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I think that's just fine, Shuuto dear. Why, even our Amane is wearing an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    uncharacteristically gentle expression."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What are you guys talking about over there?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not a thing, dear!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could have sworn that he heard some low, conspiratorial whispers from across<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the table, but his parents maintained expressions of perfect innocence.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry you had to make enough for my parents, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After they had finished dinner and chatted pleasantly for another couple of hours, it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was finally time to break up the party.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, since Amane's parents would be sleeping in his living room, Mahiru was the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    only one going home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had sent his parents to bathe, so he was the only one who stepped outside to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    see Mahiru off.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no need for him to do so, but he wanted the chance to apologize for his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mother and father, just in case.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, it's all right. This was fun."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It was?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was glad that she didn't appear upset.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If anything, she seemed like she had enjoyed herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Besides—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I got a small taste of happiness, so—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's thin voice was almost like a sigh. She smiled but also looked very lonely all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of a sudden. It was a fleeting smile, one that seemed like it could be carried away by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the breeze. Amane was starting to piece together a picture of her situation at home, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he thought he recognized the faint look of yearning in her eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Somehow, he couldn't leave it alone, and Amane put his palm on her head and stroked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her hair.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked up at Amane in surprise, but she didn't seem to hate it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wh-what are you doing?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not nothing… My hair's all messed up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're getting in the bath anyway, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I am, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Did you hate it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I—I didn't hate it, but… you could at least say something first."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Here we go."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's saying something after."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So it's okay to touch you as long as I tell you first? Amane thought, but he knew better<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than to say it out loud.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru let out a small sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Geez… I'm fine with it, but it's really not appropriate to rub a girl's head so casually."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But I don't do it to anyone else…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane understood that the only time it was okay to touch a person of the opposite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sex was when you had a close relationship. He wasn't the kind of guy who would go<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around casually rubbing up against girls or anything. The closest he came to that was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smacking Chitose whenever she made a terrible joke.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had thought that maybe he and Mahiru had gotten close enough, so he had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tentatively touched her, hoping she wouldn't hate it, but the thought wouldn't have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even occurred to him if it was anyone else.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had fallen quiet, but she hadn't shaken off his hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm sure you can see it," she said, "but you're the spitting image of your father,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane. It's obvious to me, even though I've only known him a short while."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "In what sense? I really don't think I resemble him that much, either physically or with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    my personality."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're exactly like him. Truly."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru sighed more heavily this time, and Amane rubbed her head again. She still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't seem to be against it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …Do I really resemble him that much?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sure, they had once or twice been mistaken for brothers far apart in age, but Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    felt like he had a completely different energy from his father. Their personalities, too,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while not exact opposites, nevertheless were quite different.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What could she have meant by saying that he was just like his father, despite such clear<p></p>
    <p></p>
    differences?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Any number of doubts welled up in Amane's mind, but Mahiru must not have intended<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to say anything further. Her eyes narrowed a bit, and she left the matter alone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After stroking her hair a bit more, Amane pulled back, and Mahiru seemed to suddenly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    snap back to her senses. She peered up at Amane, slightly flustered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What, you wanted me to keep going?" he asked teasingly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru flushed red again. "Please don't mock me," she said quietly, so he decided to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    call it a day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, she was in a bad mood now, for she made no attempt to hide the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    displeasure on her face as she opened the door to her own apartment and slipped<p></p>
    <p></p>
    inside.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For a brief moment, Amane regretted his actions, wondering if he had overdone it a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    little, when Mahiru cracked her door open and peeked out at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her cheeks were still pink, and her voice sounded peevish but with a slight fawning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tone to it somehow.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're a dummy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just as suddenly, Mahiru shut the door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …Well, that makes two of us, I guess.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Wasn't it Mahiru's fault that his heart was suddenly leaping in his chest?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sighed quietly, then leaned against the wall of the unheated corridor, trying to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    let the sudden burning in his chest cool a bit. That was the moment he noticed he could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    see his breath in the frosty air.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A short while after Amane had said goodnight to Mahiru and returned to his apartment,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his parents finished their bath. When Amane looked up from the TV toward the sound<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of approaching slippers, he saw them standing there in their nightclothes, casually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    holding hands.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Well, I guess that comes naturally if you've already taken a bath together.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We've had our bath, Amane. It's your turn."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure… Wait, how did you two manage to both fit in my tub? It's only big enough for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For someone living alone, this was quite a spacious, well-designed apartment, but that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't mean the bathtub was especially large. It certainly wasn't big enough for a
    <p></p>
    full-grown man and woman to sit together comfortably.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh no, it's fine! There's no problem if you get in close together. Right, Shuuto dear?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother smiled and drew closer to her husband, and his father nodded in agreement<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with a gentle smile. They had already been married for nearly twenty years, but the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    two of them still acted like newlyweds. Amane could do nothing but smile bitterly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "As loving as always, I see."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you jealous?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not really. I can relax better in the bath alone anyway."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What about Mahiru…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, listen up. Nothing is going on with her."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He didn't understand why his mother wanted so badly to hook him up with Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Well, it wasn't a total mystery, since she'd been joking about wanting Mahiru for a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    daughter-in-law since the day they'd met, but Amane was certain his mother had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mistaken the trust that Mahiru had in Amane for romantic affection.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is that so?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now, now, Shihoko. Amane's at a delicate age, so let's be considerate."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But I'm being serious…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whatever you say, Mom."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane paid his mother's words no mind as he stood up to get ready for his bath, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he stopped when his father called his name.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane." He used a serious tone, not the voice he used to chide his wife or the one that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had when he smiled. When Amane looked at him, wondering what was the matter,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was met with a soft but firm gaze.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, are you glad you moved here?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though he was caught by surprise, after a moment Amane quickly met his father's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    steady gaze with an easy smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yeah, I am. Life got easier."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Surely his parents must have been worried about him. Worried enough to frequently<p></p>
    <p></p>
    come check on how he was doing and worried enough to try to see him at every<p></p>
    <p></p>
    opportunity.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    All of it had been in order to make sure that Amane was living comfortably.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is that so? I'm glad."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't need to worry; there's someone here who I can really rely on."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unlike before—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He swallowed those words and kept his answer simple and clean.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother smiled brightly. "Oh, you must mean little Itsuki! I've never met him in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    person, so I wanted to go say hello, since we came all this way."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Give it a rest, please; you're going to start something weird."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not weird at all. I'll tell him how cute you were when you were little, and…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "See, that's exactly what I'm talking about. Seriously, just stop…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If this spilled over to Itsuki, then it was certain to reach Chitose as well. That was the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one thing Amane wanted to avoid no matter what. He did not want to deal with her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    endless teasing or put up with her badgering him for old photos from his past.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had looked remarkably like a cute little girl when he was small, and it didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    help that his mother sometimes even dressed him up in girls' clothes. If photographic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    evidence of that got out, his life would be nothing but suffering.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But I can't help wanting to say hello, can I? He's such good friends with you, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's true, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I bet he's a really good boy, isn't he? He's got the Amane seal of approval, after all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…He's a good guy. So good that he's wasted on me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't something he would ever say to Itsuki's face, but Amane always appreciated<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his friend who once took the initiative to call out in a friendly voice to a very gloomy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boy who never interacted with anyone and just sat quietly on the side of the classroom<p></p>
    <p></p>
    listening to music.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm going to take a bath."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He felt embarrassed after openly praising Itsuki, even though he wasn't there, and to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    disguise his discomfort, he quickly headed for his bedroom to retrieve a change of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clothes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He could hear a small chuckle behind his back, compelling Amane to escape to his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    room, scowling and muttering the whole way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The following morning, when Amane went out into the living room after waking up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and dressing, he found his parents already up and food on the table.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good morning. Breakfast is ready, so have a seat."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sat down at the table, smiling slightly at his father, who called to him from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kitchen, wearing Amane's apron, which had been draped over a chair.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had only just arrived in this apartment and had already made himself comfortable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in an unfamiliar kitchen, probably because he was so used to doing the cooking. At<p></p>
    <p></p>
    home, Amane's parents took turns preparing meals, so Amane was also used to seeing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his father in an apron, and there was nothing unusual about it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's mother was already waiting impatiently at the table. She probably wanted to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    help, but his father had likely insisted that she leave it to him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane also considered helping and got as far as standing up from his seat only to see<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his father bring out steaming hot rice and miso soup on a tray, immediately taking the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wind out of Amane's sails.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks, Dad."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't mention it. Anyway, Miss Shiina was kind enough to pack yesterday's leftovers<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into containers, so I just heated that up, cooked some rice, then made miso soup and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rolled omelets."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Eat a proper breakfast was practically a motto in the Fujimiya household, so they never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    skipped their morning meal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's father had happily incorporated the leftovers into the menu, but if they hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had them, there was little doubt he would have whipped up something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With a smile, Shuuto placed the rice and miso soup in front of each of them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's attention was drawn to his father's rolled omelets, which he hadn't tasted in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a while, and before he knew it, the table was set, and his father had taken his own seat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, let's get to it, shall we?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Certainly. Thank you, dear."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks for the meal."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Everyone expressed their gratitude, and then Amane reached with his chopsticks for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the rolled omelets in front of him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This was the first time Amane had eaten his father's cooking since he went home for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    summer break, so he was looking forward to the nostalgia of it as he took his first bite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and slowly chewed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The flavor of the dashi, the hint of sweetness, the slightly undercooked egg—it tasted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like home—yet at the same time, Amane found something slightly lacking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is something the matter?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His father seemed to have noticed Amane chewing with a serious expression and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sounded concerned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm… no, it's nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did I maybe mess up the seasonings?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "N-no, that's not it; it's good, but… I was just thinking that the flavor is different from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the way that Mahiru always makes omelets."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, so that's it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hadn't eaten his father's cooking for almost half a year, so even though it should<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have been familiar, he was actually more accustomed to Mahiru's cooking after eating<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it every day. Even Amane was surprised.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, that wasn't to say that his father's cooking was bad or anything, just that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's seasonings were more to Amane's tastes. But even so, he felt somewhat
    <p></p>
    self-conscious about the fact that his tongue had adapted so well to Mahiru's cooking,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    when he had only met her a few months earlier.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You've really fallen for Miss Shiina, haven't you?" his father asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For her cooking, yeah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, now," his mother crowed. "Are you saying you're not interested in Mahiru herself,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    then?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No one is saying that, and I do not intend to fall for such a leading question."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was not about to let his mother steer the conversation in that direction again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko frowned—obviously, her aim had been exactly as Amane expected. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    snorted through his nose and refused to take the bait.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His parents departed before lunch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Both of them apparently had work the next day, so Amane had suggested that it would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be hard on them if they didn't get home early and rest. They had a long drive ahead of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    them, which would of course be exhausting, so it was better if they hurried up and got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    going.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But I wanted to talk more with my dear Mahiru and meet Itsuki…," his mother<p></p>
    <p></p>
    muttered quietly after stepping out the door into the building's hallway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Then do that stuff next time… Besides, you'll have to make an appointment to see<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki. He doesn't have a lot of free time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, you set it up for me then, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If I feel like it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was obvious to everyone that Amane had no intention of doing anything of the sort.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother grew sullen, but Amane's father soothed her—and more or less restored<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her good spirits.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane was watching his parents, the door to the next-door apartment quietly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    creaked open. From the narrow crack, he could see a flash of golden hair and Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    face peeking out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She must have come out because she had heard his mother talking. For better or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    worse, his mother's voice traveled quite well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, perfect, I was just thinking about coming to say good-bye!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Both of Amane's parents noticed Mahiru and moved over to stand in front of her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment as she slipped on a pair of shoes and stepped out into the hallway. Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mother was wearing a big smile and seemed determined to get as close to Mahiru as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    possible. Mahiru shrunk back but didn't retreat entirely.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you two leaving already?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wish we weren't. Really, we'd like to stay another day or two, but we have work."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Things would be different if we had come up a little bit earlier, but… this is all the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    time we have."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru smiled placidly at Amane's parents.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, there's always next time," his mother said. "Although, next time it's Amane's turn<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to come to us."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah. I'll be home for summer vacation."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could feel his mother's gaze bearing down on him. He knew right away she was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hoping that he would bring Mahiru along with him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Still, he couldn't help but wonder if that might be a good idea. She apparently spent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her school breaks alone, after all. Maybe she wouldn't be so opposed to the idea, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought idly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really have no charm at all, Amane," his mother said. "Isn't that right, Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, I… I'm not sure how to—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come now, Shihoko, don't put her on the spot," Amane's father chided. "…Though, it's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    true that Amane has gotten less up front about various things as he's gotten older,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hasn't he?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had no allies here, so he silently pretended to ignore his parents. Shuuto<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turned to Mahiru with a gentle smile that was different than Shihoko's.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "As you can see, our Amane has a hard time expressing his feelings, but if you look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    closely, you can tell that he's a kindhearted young man. I would be very happy if you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would continue to be a good friend to him."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ugh, I'm right here, you know. This is so embarrassing…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His father had praised him, but Amane felt more like he had been goaded by an enemy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than supported by an ally.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He certainly didn't think of himself as a particularly kindhearted person. He just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    showed the people close to him the respect and affection he thought they deserved. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    felt wrong to have that confused with kindness.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Awkwardly trying to find anywhere else to look, Amane glanced over at Mahiru and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    saw her blink quickly and smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I've always thought that Amane is an honest and kind person. So much so that I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the one who should be asking for his continued friendship."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that's wonderful. That puts my mind at ease."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wanted to make a quip about his father's mind being at ease, but he was so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shaken by what Mahiru had said that he couldn't think of anything. It was so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    embarrassing to hear her describe him that way. He couldn't even look at her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother laughed as she watched him squirm, but Amane couldn't even respond. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could only bite his lip in tortured silence.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't really need to flatter me, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After Amane's parents had finally departed, he spoke to Mahiru in a quiet voice as they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stood alone in the hallway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had made that remark to relieve the awkward atmosphere somewhat, but for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some reason, Mahiru raised her eyebrows and stared at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her expression was calm, but there was a subtle edge to it that he found intimidating.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do I seem like the type to say empty words I don't mean?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you wouldn't lie to me—but maybe in front of my parents?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She seemed to object to him calling it flattery.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru huffed and then let out a sigh of exasperation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Now see here, I trust you because I think you have a good heart, and I really do like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    spending time with you. I promise: I was not trying to flatter you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "O-oh…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt the heat rushing to his face. Hearing her talk so candidly was terribly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    embarrassing. Fortunately, Mahiru did not seem to notice his unease, and he nodded<p></p>
    <p></p>
    meekly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed satisfied. "As long as you understand. Well, I suppose I'll get started on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lunch."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, Mahiru was going to fix him lunch today, just as she had done every day of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the New Year's holiday. Feeling a mixture of gratitude and shame, Amane looked down<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at Mahiru's golden hair as she placed a hand on the door to his apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Someone she can trust, huh…? That's what I was gonna say.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru ignored the fact that Amane thought she was an angel. To her, he was an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ordinary neighbor. But she trusted him. That was what he was most grateful for.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm so glad I moved here."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru must have heard his quiet mumbling, because she turned around and asked,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did you say something?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, nothing," Amane said quickly, following her into his apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    19 A New Semester<p></p>
    A new school semester had started, but not much had changed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Everyone seemed to have spent the winter vacation relaxing, so there weren't any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    major developments the way summer vacation could sometimes bring. The usual cast<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of characters was back, and no one had undergone a drastic image change or anything.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was seated at his desk, quietly gazing at a classroom that was somewhat more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boisterous than usual, when a shadow loomed over him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yo, Amane, what's good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks, can't complain."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was Itsuki, who had entered the classroom from behind Amane's seat. Itsuki was no<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exception and had also remained the same.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hadn't seen him since Christmas, but he was wearing the same flippant smile<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as always.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So did you have a good holiday?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…P-pretty much, yeah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "C'mon, you're holding something back. Was there some kind of… progress?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What? Look, it's not like that. And just so you know, nothing happened."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That wasn't actually true, of course. But Amane wouldn't dream of telling Itsuki that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had stayed over at his place, even if it had been an accident.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He knew the moment he told Itsuki, Itsuki was guaranteed to tell Chitose, and it wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hard to imagine that the two of them would start teasing and poking fun at him first<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chance they got.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Aside from that incident, all that had happened over the break was his parents coming<p></p>
    <p></p>
    over and their communal visit to the shrine, which surely fell into the category of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nothing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I didn't really do anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane found Itsuki's rather triumphant smile pretty irritating but decided that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    responding would just encourage him, so he let it go.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He looked around the classroom, hunting for some topic that would let him change<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the subject… but nothing was particularly new or notable.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As always, the girls were standing around Yuuta Kadowaki, the so-called prince of their<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grade. As always, the boys in the room were openly jealous, even though Yuuta himself<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wore a slightly troubled expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That dynamic hasn't changed one bit," Amane remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, good ol' Yuuta. Same old spectacle, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In the end, Amane, who considered it none of his business, and Itsuki, who had a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girlfriend and wasn't interested in other girls, smiled wryly at Yuuta's popularity and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    continued scanning their familiar surroundings.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come to think of it, I heard that Shiina might have a boyfriend, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A group of several girls formed nearby, and Amane could hear what they were talking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about. He suddenly stiffened.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, Risa told me, yeah. She went on a shrine visit and saw her holding hands with a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I heard! Shiina has never been swayed by anyone before, but maybe that was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because she had a boyfriend?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sounds like he was a really cool-looking guy, but Risa said she's never seen him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before. He must be from another school."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Somehow, it felt like the attention of the whole classroom shifted to the girls'<p></p>
    <p></p>
    conversation. Even Yuuta seemed to be looking over and perking up his ears.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Only Itsuki was looking at Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I didn't even ask you anything yet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not involved."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki smiled knowingly at Amane, who had shut him down in a quiet voice, then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    flicked Amane's bangs up and out of the way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Say, you always hide your face, but it's not too shabby."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can't take that as anything but mockery when you say it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki could be a real prankster, and he never seemed to take much of anything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seriously, and he was definitely a good-looking guy himself, so when he told Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he had an attractive face, it sounded decidedly sarcastic.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane knew he was an average-looking guy at best, and it made him uncomfortable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to hear other people talking about his appearance.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He slapped Itsuki's hand away from his bangs and scowled, but his friend only grinned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's just the sort of guy you are."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, can't say it's out of character."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was still acting cold, and Itsuki grinned at him without even a hint of anger.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There's a rumor going around school."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They were still seated across from each other at the dining table after dinner when he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shared the news, and Mahiru's face stiffened, as if she already knew exactly what he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was talking about.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was sure to have the most trouble from the situation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As far as Amane could tell from what he'd heard, he had yet to be identified as the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mystery man, but even so, it must have been exhausting, having everyone suddenly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asking her about having a boyfriend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That must have been why Mahiru was moving stiffly and stepping just a little wearily<p></p>
    <p></p>
    when she came over to Amane's apartment that day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's all right, because no one knows that it was you, Amane, but everyone's really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    taken it the wrong way. This is going to be a difficult misunderstanding to clear up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is holding your hand enough to turn someone into your boyfriend?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't know. For the time being, I've been strongly denying everything, telling people<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that the boy was just an acquaintance. Now we have to wait for the rumor to die down."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm, well, I guess there's nothing else we can do, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Obviously, people would think less of Mahiru if they thought that she was dating a guy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like Amane, so he hoped that the rumors would burn out quickly. She was clearly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stressed, having person after person question her about a maybe-boyfriend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At the same time, Amane felt an uneasy tinge of regret and embarrassment whenever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he heard the rumors circulating, so he also wanted to put the whole thing behind them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sighed heavily, while Mahiru just quietly cast her eyes downward.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Did we really look that much like sweethearts?" Mahiru suddenly asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wonder. To be honest, I can't really see you ever going out with a guy like me. You'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    definitely go for a smarter, more attractive guy, so I think even if I saw us standing side<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by side, I'd assume we were simply acquaintances rather than boyfriend and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girlfriend."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not true."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had answered him in a stronger voice than expected. When he turned to look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at her again, she was not wearing the worried face she'd been making earlier. Instead,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for some reason, Mahiru seemed a little… angry. She had a determined look about her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, your assessment of yourself is quite low, but it's not accurate. I think that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you're a very well-balanced person. You're kind and considerate and gentlemanly, so I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    think you've got a very good personality. And when you got all dressed up, I think you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked really nice, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her words were far too kind. Amane could scarcely believe that she was talking about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him. His face began to turn bright red. He never would have imagined that Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought so highly of him, and she was saying these things so earnestly that it made<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him feel awkward to be on the receiving end of her praise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, he was not the only one feeling a bit awkward. Midway through, Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    voice had begun to tremble, but she still looked Amane directly in the eye, making sure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he fully understood that this was her honest opinion. Of course, that didn't make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it any less embarrassing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh r-really…? Um, o-okay, thanks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "S-so, um, well… don't put yourself down so much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yeah…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't feel any urge to argue with her. It was obvious that she wouldn't hear it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's cheeks were tinged with red as she squirmed and shifted, looking at the floor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane groaned. He wasn't sure what to do, either. Anything had to be better than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doing nothing while the frustration and humiliation kept bubbling up inside him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Uh, I'm gonna go wash the dishes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "O-okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At the moment, a tactical retreat seemed like the best play. Avoid and escape. Staying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    here to watch Mahiru tremble in shame was bad for his heart.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As he took two deep breaths and then stood up from the table and gathered the dishes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and carried them to the sink, Mahiru sank into the living room sofa and buried her face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in a cushion. She was acting as if she was the one in anguish over getting unexpected<p></p>
    <p></p>
    compliments.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you're that embarrassed," Amane grumbled to himself, "maybe you shouldn't have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    said anything." But he felt as if a slight weight had been lifted off his chest by Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    words. The whole thing had been heart-wrenching, for sure, but also a bit of a relief.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though it was winter, Amane decided to wash the dishes with cold water. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hoped the icy shock would help clear his mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, hey, Amane? Can I borrow the angel?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The phone call from Chitose came in the evening, three days after the new semester<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had started.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Normally, they would talk through a messaging app, but for some unknown reason,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she actually called him. And she was asking about Mahiru. Amane was really confused.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose asked to borrow Mahiru, but Mahiru's not mine to lend out, so if Chitose wants<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some of her time, she had better ask her herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't ask me. Ask her."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is she there with you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…She is, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, ask her if she wants to hang out together tomorrow after school."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ask her yourself!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He briefly wondered if she didn't have Mahiru's contact information, but then he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    remembered at Christmastime when Chitose had been so busy messing with Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that she had completely forgotten to exchange numbers with the girl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So she must have decided that the best way to get to Mahiru was through Amane, who<p></p>
    <p></p>
    definitely had Mahiru's contact information and could often be found right beside her,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too. He could understand the thought process, but he wanted to tell her that he wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a carrier pigeon, delivering messages back and forth like it was his job.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For the time being, he decided that she had better talk to Mahiru directly, so he handed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the phone over to Mahiru, who was sitting next to him looking confused, and told her,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Chitose wants to talk to you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked perplexed but dutifully took the smartphone and held it up to her ear<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as Amane leaned back in his seat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru here… Huh, tomorrow? S-sure, I don't have any particular plans, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane smiled mischievously as he watched Mahiru's troubled expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I bet Chitose's putting the pressure on her by talking a mile a minute like always.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't look upset or anything. She just seemed earnestly surprised by the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sudden proposal and unsure how to handle it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was shooting glances over at Amane, so he told her, "I'll leave it up to your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    judgment. She wants to hang out with you, not me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even Mahiru hung out with friends sometimes, but she preferred to come home after<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a few hours and spend her time in the kitchen.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought that she could do with an excuse to go relax a bit, though he wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    entirely sure that hanging out with Chitose really lent itself to relaxation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "S-sure… Um, in that case, I think I'll accept your invitation, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Perhaps Amane's assurance had been the deciding factor. When she told Chitose as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much, the happy "Yay!!" from the other end of the phone line was clearly audible, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru reflexively pulled the phone away from her ear.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane caught Mahiru's eye and gave her a knowing smile. Chitose could be… a lot to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    handle. Mahiru also smiled, looking a bit nervous but also relieved and even happy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Chitose finally settled down, Mahiru returned the phone to her ear. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    watched them chat for another moment or two before Mahiru eventually hung up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you very much," she said politely. "Here's your phone back."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Their conversation had apparently reached a resolution, and tomorrow she would be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    joining Chitose on some excursion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that was sudden. Then again, that's how Chitose always operates."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "W-well, I certainly was surprised."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She's not a bad person. She can just be a little forceful."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane knew that was quite the understatement. Chitose usually meant well, but she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could definitely be pushy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru wore a troubled smile, as if she already knew that, but she didn't seem upset,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so that was good, Amane thought. He'd always found it a little sad how few people got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    along with their buddies' girlfriends.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Go have fun tomorrow; don't worry about me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Oh, that's right—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was one thing that Amane had to warn her about.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If she starts harassing you or makes you uncomfortable, feel free to give her a smack.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    You don't have to hold back. That girl is exactly like my mom—she loves cute things,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so she's almost certainly going to get handsy with a beauty like you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had managed to keep Chitose in check before, but now he was a little worried<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to be sending Mahiru off alone with her. Mahiru was undeniably beautiful—she turned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heads wherever she went. He knew she had to be careful about getting hit on by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    strangers, but Chitose was another matter. Yes, he had relied on Chitose's keen insight<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the occasion of Mahiru's birthday, but he also knew that when it came to cute<p></p>
    <p></p>
    things, the girl just couldn't help herself. Amane felt it was necessary to at least warn<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru about Chitose's wandering hands.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now, I don't think she's going to bother you too much, but if you only give her a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    halfhearted rejection, she's bound to get excited and pounce you, so be careful." Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    noticed that Mahiru's lips were pressed tightly together so he cocked his head<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quizzically and asked, "Hey, what's up?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Nothing at all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru quietly averted her eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    On the day that Mahiru was supposed to hang out with Chitose, Amane hurried home<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and spent some quiet time alone for the first time in a while.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recently, he and Mahiru had been spending pretty much every day together, especially<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with her making his lunch sometimes, so this was almost like a holiday for Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, he was happy that they were together so often… but sometimes it was nice<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to have space to himself like this, too.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The seat beside him felt a little cold, though.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Man, I really got used to having Mahiru around, huh?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Only a few months had passed since they'd first met, and he was already taking her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    presence for granted. Amane felt like they'd gotten very close, more like two people<p></p>
    <p></p>
    who'd known each other for years, rather than months. He figured that they must be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quite compatible.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Personally, Amane really liked where they were in their relationship—they were close<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough to enjoy the time they spent together without stepping on each other's toes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The only problem was, he liked it so much that he didn't want to let go.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Man, I'm simpleminded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't the kind of guy to come out and passionately declare his love, but he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couldn't deny that his feelings for Mahiru went far beyond those of a neighbor and a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    friend. At the same time, he refused to allow himself to develop any serious romantic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    interest in her. If he let the scales tip any further, he didn't think he would be able to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    see Mahiru as a friend anymore. Amane was aware of the tension in his heart, and it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    made him deeply uneasy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That's why he took his romantic feelings and stuffed them deep down in his gut where<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nobody would see them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru would only be troubled by his affection, he knew. She cared about him in her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    own way, but it was obvious that she was not in love with him or anything like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way that she would ever fall for a loser like him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sure, she sometimes said nice things about him, but that didn't mean she thought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about him that way, and if he tried to complicate their relationship by taking it in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    direction that she didn't like, it would only make things awkward.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane turned to look out the window, hoping to get away from the squirming<p></p>
    <p></p>
    uneasiness in his chest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was winter, so the days ended early, and a curtain of utter darkness had fallen over<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the sky. It was just past six o'clock, but it already seemed late at night.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was with Chitose, so she wasn't going to be out too late, but even so, he felt a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    little anxious at the idea of two good-looking high school girls walking around alone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in this darkness.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When will you two be done?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he sent this message to Chitose, who always kept her smartphone close, he got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a reply right away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    We're saying good-bye soon.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Feeling relieved that Chitose wasn't going to keep them out all night, Amane sent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    another message asking when they expected to get to the station. Then he stood up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from the sofa and headed for the bathroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I think I have a little hair wax left over from the other day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He wasn't all that interested in styling his hair, but if he was planning to go meet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru in public, it was the least he could do.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he was being honest, getting dressed up was a huge pain, but Amane's parents had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    taught him how to make himself presentable. Surely he could reproduce the hairstyle<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from memory.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he looked in the mirror, Amane saw his usual gloomy self staring back at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He popped open the hair wax, confident that he could transform the uncouth,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unfashionable youth standing before him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was the middle of winter, and on top of that, the sun had set, so the temperature had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dipped quite low.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After considering both warmth and fashion, Amane decided on a light-gray sweater<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and navy blue peacoat, paired with fleece-lined black skinny jeans, but even so, he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    undeniably cold. He could only imagine how cold Mahiru must have felt in only her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school uniform and jacket.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though Mahiru wore thick tights during the winter, her uniform's skirt, its length<p></p>
    <p></p>
    determined by school regulations, still looked downright freezing to him. He wanted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to tell her it'd be better to wear sweatpants underneath it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Some of the girls he walked past were wearing even shorter skirts. Amane was keenly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    aware of the tremendous lengths some people would go to in pursuit of fashion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As these thoughts bounced around in his mind, he nestled the lower half of his face in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the scarf he had received from Mahiru and hurried to the nearest station.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, the girls had taken the train to a big shopping complex. The station was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    within walking distance of Amane's apartment, and according to Chitose, the train<p></p>
    <p></p>
    should be arriving any moment, so he had probably shown up at just the right time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane walked, his freshly styled hair was blown about a bit by the wind, but not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    badly enough to mess it up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If it had gotten too ruffled, of course he would have had to stop to fix it, however<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reluctant he might be. Amane was quickly gaining a newfound respect for anyone who<p></p>
    <p></p>
    strove to be fashionable every day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was walking silently, lost in his own thoughts, when the station came into view.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Considering the direction of the apartment complex, Mahiru should come out of this exit,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so if I wait nearby, I'm sure I'll see her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He leaned against the wall near the exit and waited, checking the time. Before long, a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girl with familiar blond hair came out of the gates.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru!" he called out to her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recognizing his voice, Mahiru turned to look—and the moment she laid eyes on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane, she practically froze.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah… what? Wh-why?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was obviously surprised by his appearance. Chitose must have told her that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was coming to meet her, but she clearly hadn't expected him to show up looking like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had during their New Year's shrine visit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But Amane hadn't even entertained the idea of coming out with his usual sloppy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    appearance and normal hairdo. He would be in trouble if someone identified him as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the mystery man, so if he was going to accompany Mahiru in public, he needed to dress<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up a bit. He had to disguise himself, of course, but he also felt like he should look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decent if he was going to be seen with her in public.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What, did you think I couldn't dress myself? I can't exactly come meet you at the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    station in my normal clothes, now can I?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I suppose not, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Does it look bad? I checked myself in the mirror, but maybe it's weird…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had chosen an ordinary, safe outfit and tried to style his hair like it had been on the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    day of the shrine visit, so Amane had hoped that he didn't look too strange. But now<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he realized that it probably looked all wrong to anybody with real taste.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He could feel people's gazes flicker over him from time to time, so there was a good<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chance that he did look weird after all. It was a bit of a shock to realize that he looked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unfashionable despite trying his best.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But Mahiru shook her head, appearing flustered. "It looks good," she reassured him,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and Amane felt himself breathe a sigh of relief.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm glad you think so. Look, it's already dark, right? It would be dangerous to walk<p></p>
    <p></p>
    home alone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I kn-know that, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I guess you probably didn't want me to come meet you after all. Well, if you don't want<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to walk together, I can walk a little ways ahead, and you can just follow me, I guess…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I—I never said that. I, umm… really do appreciate it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was happy to hear that she didn't object to him being there. He pulled a hand<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out of his pocket and offered it to her. Timidly, she pressed her palm into his. Maybe it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was because of the cold weather, but her hand felt much chillier than he expected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So cold. What happened to your gloves?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I washed them, so they're still drying. And anyway, where are yours?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I just stuck my hands in my pockets."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He couldn't scold her too much, since he'd also forgotten to wear gloves, a lesson he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    should have learned as a child.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't say anything further and simply kept her dainty hand nestled in his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    palm. It felt incredibly delicate compared to his.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…So warm…," Mahiru mumbled quietly, and her eyes twinkled happily as she smiled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt his heart wrench when he saw her innocent expression, but he refused to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    let it show and kept his attention solely focused on her small hand in his as he casually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slipped Mahiru's schoolbag, as well as several shopping bags she'd acquired on her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    outing, over his shoulder.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru glanced up at him but didn't say anything.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What is it?" he asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Abruptly, Mahiru turned away. Her ears and cheeks were slightly red, probably from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the cold, he thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, let's go home. Do you want to stop at the convenience store on the way? The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pork buns are good this time of year."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm happy with a sweet bean bun."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You sure do like sweets… What are we doing about dinner?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I've marinated some eggs and prepared some char siu pork and bamboo shoots, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    we're having ramen."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ramen is perfect on a cold day, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, it is."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hadn't looked in the refrigerator, so he was pleasantly surprised to hear the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    evening's menu. Sure, the soup and noodles would be prepackaged, but Mahiru had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    made the toppings by hand. Amane's mouth started to water as he imagined the thick<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slices of pork and perfectly seasoned soft-boiled eggs.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They were sure to hit the spot on a chilly winter evening.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I wonder if I'll be able to eat a whole bowl of ramen after a bean bun?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well then, how about you give me half? That way, you can probably finish both."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For some reason, Mahiru looked a little embarrassed, so Amane smiled slightly and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    squeezed her hand just a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shiina was spotted with another mystery man!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The following day, Itsuki shot him a hard look. "Not only are the rumors still spreading,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    somebody added fuel to the fire. What're ya gonna do, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane turned away sharply. "Hell if I know…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    20 The Angel in Poor Health<p></p>
    It happened on a Friday, on one of the last days of January.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane returned to the living room after cleaning up dinner, but when he looked at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, he noticed that her cheeks were unusually red.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At first, he thought that maybe the thermostat was set too high, but it was on the same<p></p>
    <p></p>
    temperature as always, and Mahiru wasn't wearing particularly warm clothing, either.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he looked closely, he saw that her expression seemed distant and kind of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unfocused. Her breathing was also shallower than usual. All signs pointed to her being<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sick.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he took a moment to think about it, the weather had gotten much colder lately,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and Mahiru, as an honors student, had been busy helping her teacher with some big<p></p>
    <p></p>
    project. On top of that, she was doing her usual housework and making dinner for the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    two of them. It wasn't strange at all for her to fall ill with such a workload.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane admonished himself for not noticing her condition earlier. He regretted not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    paying more attention to her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, your face is red. Do you think you have a fever?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course not."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru decisively dismissed Amane's concerns. Her expression was stiff, and she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shook her head, but she couldn't hide the redness in her cheeks.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Obviously, he couldn't just take her word for it, so even though he knew that it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rude to touch her without her permission, Amane gently placed the palm of his hand<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on Mahiru's forehead, which was usually hidden by her bangs.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As he had expected, her head was much hotter than his palm. Mahiru's typical body<p></p>
    <p></p>
    temperature wasn't that high compared to Amane's, so it was pretty clear she had a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fever.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're hot as the sun."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…No, I'm not."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, how about we take your temperature and confirm it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There's no need. You're worrying over nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her voice was thin and lacked her usual energy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, come on. I can tell by looking at you that you're running a fever."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm just a bit flushed."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If that's the case, then you'll need to take your temperature and prove it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane stood up and retrieved a thermometer from the first aid box on the shelf in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    living room. He brought it back to Mahiru, but she turned her face away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She either didn't want to acknowledge her fever, or she insisted on bluffing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was probably one or the other, but Amane couldn't really proceed until she agreed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to have her temperature taken. He stood right in front of the uncooperative Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and placed the thermometer firmly in her hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, either I can loosen your clothes and stick the thermometer in your armpit,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or you can take your own temperature… Which do you prefer?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane put on a very serious face when he made this threat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru let out a startled groan and turned her body toward the back of the sofa. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed like she had resigned herself to it, and he heard the sound of the thermometer<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turning on, so just to be safe, Amane also turned his back to Mahiru and waited for her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to finish.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Before long, he heard another electronic beep. Amane waited for Mahiru to put her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clothes back in order. When he turned around, she was looking at him, expressionless,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    holding the thermometer in its case.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thirty-seven point two degrees Celsius. A slight fever, all right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's only a little higher than usual, and I still feel totally fine, so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane took the thermometer from Mahiru's hand and removed it from the case again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The thermometer Amane had used was the type that recorded the previously measured<p></p>
    <p></p>
    temperature, and when he turned it on again—sure enough, it displayed a temperature<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more than one whole degree higher than Mahiru had reported.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh yeah? I see thirty-eight point four here."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She averted her eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Seriously, have you been running yourself ragged and letting me sit on my butt the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whole time? You're taking all day tomorrow and tomorrow night off. No buts."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane caught a cold, Mahiru had put him to bed and had him change into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pajamas and brought him rice porridge, but he wondered how she would fare doing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nothing when it was her turn.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had a relatively sturdy constitution, so he'd simply gone to sleep and woken<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up feeling better, but if Mahiru didn't rest and kept running around, she would never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    recover, even from something relatively minor. Mahiru was sick, and that meant no<p></p>
    <p></p>
    straining herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, Mahiru was still avoiding his gaze. She didn't seem likely to agree to a strict<p></p>
    <p></p>
    regimen of bed rest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …So stubborn… Well, I guess there's no other way, then.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane extended a hand to Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The fever was slowing her down, and it took her a moment to turn to him. Thinking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that it would be just perfect if she didn't resist, Amane put his arms around Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    back and under her knees and lifted her off the sofa.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Carrying her like a child, so that she had to cling tightly to him, Amane checked that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he could hear the sound of jangling keys from Mahiru's pocket and headed for the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, A-Amane…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed to finally realize that she was being carried, and he heard her flustered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    voice coming from between his arms.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane stopped for a moment and looked down at her, Mahiru's cheeks were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    still red with fever, and she was peering up at him with confusion in her eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're definitely going to push yourself too hard, so I'm going to keep watch until you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fall asleep."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-you're going to barge into a girl's bedroom?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you don't like that idea, you can sleep in my room."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…And the option for you to leave me alone…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That ship sailed when you refused to rest."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even Amane knew that no matter how close of a friend he was, going into a girl's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment, and what's more, into her bedroom, and standing guard until she fell<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asleep, would be a serious invasion of her privacy. It was definitely not something he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would ever even consider under normal circumstances. But after seeing the way she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was acting, he was seriously worried for her health. He just knew that Mahiru would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    run herself into the ground if he didn't do something. As far as he was concerned, there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't any other option.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Long ago, Mahiru had forced her way into his apartment, so he figured that just this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    once, he would employ the same forceful measures for her sake.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay, which do you prefer? My house or yours?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…And if I say I don't like either?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you say that, then we default to barging into your apartment so I can toss you into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bed."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Your room is fine…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, Mahiru didn't want Amane bursting into her bedroom, so she finally<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relented and agreed to rest in Amane's room instead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane exhaled hard—neither a sigh nor a breath of relief. I understand why she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wouldn't want to let a boy into her room, he thought as he carried her to his bed. And I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    know she didn't make a huge fuss, either. But if she was going to be so stubborn about it,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I wish she would have just stayed home and rested up in the first place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru hadn't been in Amane's bedroom since New Year's.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For the moment, he lowered Mahiru onto the bed, then started fishing through his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dresser drawers. He figured it would be best if she changed into something she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wouldn't have to worry about getting sweat on before going to sleep. He chose the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smallest shirt and sweatpants he had, then set them down by Mahiru's side.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here. Change into these."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…But—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Or I can strip you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'll get changed…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru reluctantly picked up the change of clothes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was not at all prepared to carry out his threat, and he didn't think Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would have let him anyway. Just thinking about it made him want to die of shame. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was thoroughly relieved to hear that she would play along.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since he wasn't about to stay and watch her change, Amane quickly left the room and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    retrieved some sports drinks from his pantry shelf.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After Amane had recovered from his cold the previous year, he had stocked up on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    prepackaged rice porridge, extra sports drinks, and cooling sheets. His preparations<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were finally paying off.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Carrying the supplies, along with a towel and some medicine, Amane knocked on the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    door of his own bedroom and heard a small voice reply, "I've finished changing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He entered and saw Mahiru looking at him, propped up on his bed, wearing his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clothes. As expected, even the smallest clothes he had were too large on Mahiru—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    baggy was probably the most accurate word.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She looked adorable, dressed in clothes that were the wrong size, but Amane drove<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that thought from his mind and set down the sports drinks and towel on the table<p></p>
    <p></p>
    beside the bed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Will you take some medicine? It's over-the-counter stuff."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Sure. I have the same type at home, so I think it's all right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He went back to the kitchen for a moment and filled a cup with water. While he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there, he fished an ice pack out of the freezer. He recalled the saying "Preparation is<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the key to success" and smiled to himself about how true that was turning out to be.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hurried back to the bedroom and handed the water to Mahiru, then took some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pills out of the packaging and put them in her open palm.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Take those and drink plenty of water. Then get to sleep."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While Mahiru was swallowing the medicine, he wrapped the ice pack in the towel and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    set it beside her pillow. As he did, he heard Mahiru mumble "…You're pretty well<p></p>
    <p></p>
    prepared."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm just doing everything you did for me, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Basically, he was just repeating exactly what Mahiru had done when she nursed him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    back to health. He was healthy now, so it was only natural that he should return the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    favor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "By the way, why were you trying to push yourself so hard?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Because I'm incapable of effective self-management."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look, you have to draw the line somewhere. You're always running around, working<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hard, and your body is probably all worn out. Come to think of it, I guess I owe you an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apology for my part in keeping you so busy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Making his dinner every night had undoubtedly placed an extra burden on Mahiru that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she clearly didn't need. She had her own life to deal with, and here she was taking care<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of him. It was inexcusable, really.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's fever seemed to be connected to her fatigue, so Amane wanted to care of her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the best he could and let her rest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I've never thought of you as a burden, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Really…? Well, even if that's true, think of this as a good opportunity for you to take it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    easy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was happy to hear her say that she didn't find the time they spent together to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    taxing, but he still felt guilty about how much attention she had paid to his needs. This<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was his chance to tend to Mahiru while she got some rest. It would probably actually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be better to send her home, but Amane wanted to stay by her side. He knew he would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    never forgive himself if anything happened to her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru hesitated but eventually agreed to lie down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She buried everything up to her neck under the comforter, then glanced at Amane. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked slightly embarrassed, probably because she didn't like having someone standing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    over her while she slept. Amane was about to leave her alone, thinking that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shouldn't stare at girls in their sleep, when he felt something tug at his sleeve. When<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he looked down, he found Mahiru's small hand grasping at his shirt.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was also staring at her hand, caramel-coloured eyes wide with shock. She looked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just as surprised as he did. A moment passed, and then she quickly released him and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    buried herself completely under the comforter, pulling it all the way up over her face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to hide.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Good night," came a feeble mumble from Mahiru, cocooned in the blanket.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane scratched his cheek, unsure what to do.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …She gets really anxious when she's not feeling well, huh?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Figuring she would probably forgive him, he turned back the comforter a little bit,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    until he found Mahiru's hand and grabbed hold of it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He squeezed it gently, and Mahiru stuck her face out from under the comforter, wearing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a troubled expression. But Amane had a feeling that was more from embarrassment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than anger.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm not a child, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know. I'll just be here keeping watch so that you won't run away, so don't mind me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm not running away this late in the game."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wonder. Well, I'll get out of here once you're asleep, so you can relax. Come on, if you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want me to leave, hurry up and fall asleep."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was being very direct. But it worked. Mahiru meekly snuggled back down<p></p>
    <p></p>
    under the comforter, and he felt her squeeze his hand back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He felt sort of happy, and embarrassed, and for some reason, agitated. It was like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone was tickling the inside of his chest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane kept hold of her slender fingers until he heard her peaceful sleeping breaths.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The following morning, Amane woke up on the sofa and checked the clock as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stretched his stiff body.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was just past eight in the morning. It wasn't a school day, and he almost never got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up this early on the weekends, but Amane wanted to see how Mahiru was doing, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decided he'd better get a move on. He had peeked in on her just in case during the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    night and confirmed that she looked like she was sleeping peacefully, but he couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tell what her true condition was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He stood up and stretched, then quietly headed toward his own bedroom and opened<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the door without making a sound.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hadn't knocked in case Mahiru was still sleeping, but when he opened the door, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sat up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her cheeks were still slightly red, but not as red as the night before, and although her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression was slack and somewhat bleary, her eyes focused when she spotted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Morning. How are you feeling? The truth, please."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm still sluggish."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Gotcha. I'm going to the convenience store to buy breakfast and something that you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    might be able to eat."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He did have that rice porridge, but he had the image that sick people ate meal<p></p>
    <p></p>
    supplement jelly and canned peaches and thought those might be easier to eat, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that's what he was planning to get.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was relieved to find that she seemed to be doing better than expected, and he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pulled another change of clothes out of the dresser and set them on the bed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm leaving you a change of clothes here. Make sure you take your temperature, too.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If you want to wipe off the sweat, go ahead and use the water in that wash basin and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this towel."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Before leaving the room, Amane pointed to the basin he had used to wipe the sweat<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from her face during the night.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Then he retrieved his wallet and left the apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Walking at a leisurely pace, Amane made sure that Mahiru would have plenty of time<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to wipe herself off and change her clothes, even if her fever slowed her down. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    convenience store was located quite close to their apartment building, so he could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have made the trip in just a few minutes, but he was careful and took his time shopping.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane returned home after spending a solid twenty minutes out of the house and put<p></p>
    <p></p>
    away the cold items in the refrigerator. When he finally went in to see Mahiru, she had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    finished changing and was waiting for him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She also seemed more alert and already looked healthier than the day before. She was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smiling faintly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Any fever?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thirty-seven point five degrees."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm, still slightly high… Don't move around too much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I kn-know that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do you have an appetite? I've got some rice porridge here, and I also bought pudding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and jelly."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He knew he shouldn't let her eat anything too heavy, so he had brought back things<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that were easy to eat and soft, but what she ate would depend on Mahiru's appetite.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, sorry you went to the—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't apologize. You did the same thing for me. So pudding or jelly, which do you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Jelly."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here ya go. Do you think you can eat some rice porridge as well?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, I'll heat it up; so you sit tight."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane shuffled out of the room. He was concerned about Mahiru. She seemed anxious.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane placed a pouch of rice porridge in some hot water to warm it up, then poured<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it into a bowl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he was really going to repay Mahiru for what she did last time, he probably should<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have made the porridge by hand, but he honestly wasn't sure he would have been able<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to pull it off without messing up something, so he'd decided to fall back on the reliable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    instant pouches.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was sure it would be nothing next to Mahiru's homemade porridge, but Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    figured the most important thing was that she had something, anything, to eat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here. Think you can manage to eat on your own?" Amane asked her jokingly as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    held out a spoon and waited for her to take the bowl of porridge.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru scowled at him sullenly. "Are you making fun of me? And what if I said I can't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eat on my own—I suppose you'd offer to feed me?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, I mean… I'll feed you if you want, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's face went red, as if her fever had made a sudden comeback.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I-I'll eat by myself."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yeah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She accepted the bowl from Amane and started taking small bites, but the redness did<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not disappear by the time she was done eating.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She seemed to still have some appetite after finishing the porridge, so she opened the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    jelly next. Once she put that away as well, she sighed. She looked much better now, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all that was left was to get some rest so she could regain her strength. Amane was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rather relieved.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is there anything else you want me to do?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Nothing for now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane stood up to leave, thinking that he should probably just let her rest more,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru slowly looked up at him, as if making some sort of request. Her gaze was steady<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and direct.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sensing the fear and anxiety lurking behind her caramel-coloured eyes, Amane sat<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down right next to Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he told her up front that she seemed lonely, Mahiru would probably deny it outright<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and chase him away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So Amane sat quietly by the bedside and simply looked over at Mahiru, who was sitting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up in bed. "I'm not busy right now anyway. How about we just chat until you get a little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sleepy?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Okay." She nodded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He smiled at her as he leaned against the bed, and Mahiru also smiled faintly as if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reassured.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…This is the first time someone's ever really taken care of me when I'm sick… Even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Miss Koyuki went home when her shift was over."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Miss Koyuki?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The maid who worked for us when I was at home."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, the person who taught you how to cook?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I was always alone in the mornings and evenings, so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I'm here now. Besides, I'll be in a serious pinch if you don't hurry up and get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    well."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm sorry for using your bed. And about dinner…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not what I meant. It's awful, you know? I just want to see my friend get better."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though they had only known each other a relatively short while, after all the time<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they'd spent together, it was only natural for Amane to worry about her. Even if she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hadn't been running herself ragged taking care of him among other things, Amane still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would have worried about her. She was his friend, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And besides, I'm not the type of person who celebrates when someone else gets sick."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I know that already. You're a nice person, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, ma'am."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was a little embarrassed and felt awkward being told directly to his face that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was nice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Go ahead and get some rest… You'll feel better if you sleep as much as you need."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shall I stand guard until you drift off again?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane made a joke to hide his embarrassment, but Mahiru blinked in surprise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yes, please do."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You suggested it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I did, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He never imagined that she would accept. He had expected Mahiru to glow bright red<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and immediately reject the idea. His eyes went wide in surprise, and now Mahiru was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the one wearing an impish smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Or does a man go back on his word?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Absolutely not. Time to lie down," Amane muttered quietly. Then he added "You win<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this round" as he squeezed Mahiru's hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She slipped under the covers. Then she looked at her hand resting in Amane's, and her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression softened.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's so warm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your fever must have gone down a lot, if you've cooled off… All right, get some sleep."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She squeezed his hand once in return. She looked like she was relieved that he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there after all. Slowly, her eyes drifted closed, and before long, Amane could hear the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    regular rhythm of her sleeping breath.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …You dummy, he groaned, covering his face with his other hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whenever the two of them touched like this, Amane lost his cool. His heart was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pounding in his ears, and his face felt so hot that, for a moment, he wondered if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's fever had jumped hosts. Amane was so flushed that he almost forgot which<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of them was supposed to have the fever.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …This girl is really bad for my heart.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane glanced over at Mahiru and saw her sleeping peacefully, entirely relaxed and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    blissfully ignorant of Amane's woes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane swore under his breath and buried his face in the bedsheets.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was his bed, but it had a sweet scent, a little different from his own.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane came to, Mahiru's warmth had disappeared.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The hand he had been holding was gone, leaving Amane facedown in the bed, all alone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He looked around the room in alarm, but Mahiru was obviously not in bed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane looked at the clock on the side table, saw that it was two, and then realized<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he had crashed. He thought maybe it was because he had gotten up to check on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru during the night, but even so, Amane had never intended to sleep for so long.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Flustered, Amane stood up and headed for the living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He moved briskly, and it wasn't long before he saw Mahiru sitting with good posture on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the living room sofa. She wasn't dressed in his shirt and sweatpants anymore, but in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her own clothing, which likely meant that she'd gone home for a bit before returning.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, good morning."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Morning. You weren't there when I woke up, so I panicked a little."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry. I took a quick shower and came back."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That must have been why she had changed clothes. Feeling relieved that she was well<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough to bathe, he pressed his palm against Mahiru's forehead just in case, but she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was already back to her usual temperature.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm, seems like your fever broke. That's great."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm sorry for worrying you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You should be. Next time I'm going to do the same exact thing if you're not honest<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He said this as he was taking a seat next to Mahiru, and she frowned uneasily.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'll be careful, but… Amane, won't you be angry if I cause you trouble again?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Trouble?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Because you had to nurse me and everything…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "As if I'd ever consider any of that trouble, you dummy. Do I honestly seem that heartless<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Not at all. It's just… I was only wondering if it's all right to rely on you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You should rely on people for whatever you can. You're definitely the type who tries<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to take everything upon yourself even when you don't need to."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They had only been together for a few months, but even so, Amane thought he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    understood Mahiru's temperament pretty well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She fundamentally didn't like to rely on other people, and she bottled up all her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feelings deep inside and tried to never let them show. She seemed like she shut herself<p></p>
    <p></p>
    off from other people by building a wall that she didn't want anyone to slip behind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, I know that I'm not very trustworthy, and you can't rely on me, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Th-that's not true! I trust you a lot, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good. Then don't force yourself and let me help you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without thinking, he reached out and ruffled Mahiru's hair, only after which he noticed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Mahiru had gone completely still.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry. You hate that, don't you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Not exactly, no…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru shook her head slowly, not to disentangle his hand from her hair, but to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    disagree with his statement, then leaned her forehead against his upper arm.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His heart leaped in his chest when he felt the slight weight of her body pressing against<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him, but without revealing it in the least, he patted her head once more. He heard a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    truly quiet little whisper: "…Thank you so much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    21 Valentine’s Day<p></p>
    By the beginning of February, rumors concerning Mahiru's "mystery man, possible<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boyfriend" finally died down, despite the fact that Amane had carelessly added fuel to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the fire by picking her up from the station.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even so, the idea of a boy who was not her boyfriend but was still very close to Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed to have taken root instead, and the new rumor was that Mahiru had feelings<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for that boy… but Mahiru cheerfully denied it all in her friendly but ultimately<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unyielding way, so eventually the stream of gossip dried up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had heard from Chitose, who had been observing the situation in the hallways,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that "her denial left no room for argument," so it seemed like Mahiru was pretty upset.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He wasn't surprised, but he was a little sad to hear how vehemently she was denying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it. Still, he knew there wasn't much to be done about it. The current situation was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably driving Mahiru crazy, having to listen to all these wild rumors about a guy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she didn't even like that way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could do nothing but wear a wry smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So speaking of February…," Chitose prodded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh yeah, final exams are coming up," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You know, for a teenage boy, you sure lack imagination."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose didn't hide her disapproval at his reply.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She had paid him a visit at his apartment after school—or rather, she had barged in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    without an invitation—on the pretense that she had something important to discuss,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though Amane was pretty sure she'd actually come to hang out with Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Incidentally, Mahiru was in the kitchen putting on a pot of tea, so Amane and Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were alone in the living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't know about other high school guys and their imaginations, but I'd say that's a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reasonable train of thought for any student…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A high school guy in the prime of his life should be thinking about Valentine's Day,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    don't you think?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not in the prime of anything so no…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There you go again!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose was giving him a mischievous look even though she should know better than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    most that there was no truth behind the rumors.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane glared at her, but her smile refused to crack. "So…," he said with a sigh, "what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    did you want to talk about?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose had made a point to come to Amane's apartment alone. She obviously had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something she wanted to discuss with Amane and Mahiru, but not with her boyfriend,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm. I wanted to ask you what I should do about chocolates for Itsuki. When we were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in middle school, I made him chocolates out of a kit, the kind where you melt the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chocolate and pour it into a mold, but since we're high schoolers now, I'd like to make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something more sophisticated."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "In that case, Shiina's the one you oughtta ask."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After all, Amane knew nothing about cooking. At most, he might be able to offer some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    insight into his best friend's tastes, but Chitose had actually been dating Itsuki for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    longer than Amane had known him, so she probably knew what Itsuki liked better<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than he did.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm gonna ask her, too, but I thought since you're sorta a guy… you know? Maybe I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could get a male opinion."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not sorta anything. I'm all man."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you were a real man, you'd have made a move on a certain pretty girl by now,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose said slyly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now, listen," Amane said with a grimace, "I've explained this before—we don't have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that sort of relationship. And besides, a real man is supposed to wait until he's in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relationship to make a move."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, how wonderfully chivalrous of you," Chitose teased. "Your mama must have raised<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose might think he was uptight, but Amane didn't see anything wrong with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wanting to take it slow. Sure, plenty of guys could mess around with girls they didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even like, but could wasn't the same as should. More importantly, Amane couldn't see<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself doing that, especially if the other party just wasn't interested.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now, it would have been a lie to say that he didn't have certain feelings for Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Spending time with a girl so beautiful—inside and out—would stir up those sorts of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    emotions in most any man.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But even then, the foolish idea to try something with had her never surfaced.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whenever he thought about it, all kinds of other things got in the way—worrying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about hurting her feelings, worrying that she might come to hate him, worrying that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he did not appreciate her enough.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Also, Mahiru had made it quite clear that trying anything would result in serious social<p></p>
    <p></p>
    repercussions, as well as grievous physical harm to a certain vital organ, and he did<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not think that she was bluffing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that's one of your good points, Amane, and I'm sure it's why Mahirun feels like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she can trust you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose had started referring to Mahiru by a nickname that had a cute ring to it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was listening in from the kitchen, but she didn't stop Chitose from calling her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that, so whether she was reluctant or comfortable with the name herself, she must<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have known that she had a nickname now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As far as Mahiru was concerned, it was better than being called an angel to her face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Though sometimes I wonder whether you're really a man at all…," Chitose continued.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can assure you, I am. I mean, have you ever seen a girl this flat?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you're much too passive. A man is supposed to be a little ferocious sometimes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You think a guy like me could pull off ferocious?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You'd be fine if you dressed the part like those other times. Honestly, I'd like to see it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for myself."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki and Chitose had long since deduced that Amane was Mahiru's mystery man, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had finally acknowledged it just the other day, so there was no point in hiding it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    now. But he wasn't about to get all dressed up just for their amusement.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Give it up already."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on; it's no big deeeal!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can't spare the hair wax—or the patience, for that matter."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Cheapskate!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Mahiru returned from the kitchen carrying a tray with three cups of milk tea,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose had puffed out her cheeks and was pouting at him. Mahiru smiled as she set<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the tray on the coffee table.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sprung up from the sofa and moved to a cushion on the floor, gesturing for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru to sit down. She gingerly took the now-vacant seat, looking apologetic.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But if you look good enough to gossip about," Chitose continued, "imagine how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    popular you'd be if you dressed that way all the time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way. It's a huge hassle, and I don't even wanna be popular in the first place."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whaaat? Not even with Valentine's Day coming up? Don't you want to get lots of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chocolate, Amane? Like, he's just one example, but Yuu's super popular, and it seems<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like he gets tons of chocolates. Aren't you the slightest bit jealous?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way. I'd get diabetes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    By Yuu, Chitose must have been referring to Yuuta. Assigning weird nicknames to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    people seemed to be one of Chitose's many habits. Fortunately, she hadn't gotten<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around to thinking of one for Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Maybe Yuuta—dubbed the prince—did receive tons of chocolate, but there was no<p></p>
    <p></p>
    way he could eat it all without getting fat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Anyway, it's depressing just to think about the returns," Amane added. "I mean,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    between the chocolates people just give out to be polite and the ones people give out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to confess their feelings, Kadowaki's probably on the receiving end of several dozen<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gifts, and then he has to pay all those back threefold. That's gotta be hell on a high<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school student's wallet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How admirable to assume that he's going to pay everything back threefold. Well, I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    going to give you some chocolate, and you don't need to worry about return gifts or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anything like that. What kind do you like?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not really into sweet things, so… something not too sweet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Got it; I'll come up with something."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't put anything funny in there."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine; it'll all be edible."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't sure what Chitose was planning, but he was definitely expecting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something more than an ordinary box of chocolates.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahirun, who are you giving chocolate to?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The girls I'm friends with in my class."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not to any boys?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…If I give anyone chocolate, even courtesy chocolate, they take it the wrong way, so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah-ha."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could easily imagine the uproar among the boys—and the pointless fighting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that was sure to follow. Most of the boys in his class would treat chocolate from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school angel like mana from heaven, so if word got around that Mahiru was giving out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chocolate, it would definitely mean trouble. Amane wasn't sure whether Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    popularity or the boys' foolishness was more to blame.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Obviously, it's safer for Mahiru to avoid giving out any chocolate at all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane nodded and smiled to himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, and I'll also save some chocolate for you, Chitose."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yaaay! I love you, Mahirun. I'll give you some, too. The real stuff, not like what I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    giving Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I heard that!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose was grinning widely as she squeezed Mahiru tight.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was relieved to see the way she was touching Mahiru didn't constitute sexual<p></p>
    <p></p>
    harassment, but he kept a sharp eye on Chitose to make it clear he wouldn't let her get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    away with anything.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm just joookiiing. I'm gonna give you the edible stuff, too, okay, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I have a feeling that edible and tasty are two very different things here…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane pressed a hand to his forehead. He could feel a headache coming on. Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was certainly excited about her latest plot. She didn't even try to hide her delight as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she laughed at Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm sure you'll enjoy your present!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    On Valentine's Day, as Amane had predicted, the mood at school was tense. Everyone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was restless; no one could settle down. Many people believed that a guys' social status<p></p>
    <p></p>
    depended on whether he received chocolates on Valentine's Day. At the moment, most<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of the boys were trying to act like they weren't desperately waiting for something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Everyone's all worked up, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It certainly seemed nerve-racking. Amane, on the other hand, didn't care a bit about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his social standing, so he had the privilege of watching the day pass through the eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of a remote observer. His attention turned to Itsuki, who also had nothing to worry<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about today, though for a different reason.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Looks that way," Itsuki answered, staring nonchalantly across the classroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mr. Itsuki, as a man with a girlfriend—a man who, I might add, appears totally calm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    today—we'd like to ask for your opinion on this year's Valentine's Day proceedings."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, Amane, the boys certainly look desperate. Understandable, considering that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whether they receive chocolates today can have major ramifications on their sense of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pride as men in the coming weeks. And let's not forget that approximately sixty percent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of these fine young fellows are, at this very moment, sweating over whether they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    might receive chocolates from the lovely lady Shiina."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Apparently, she's not giving anything to the guys, not even courtesy chocolate. Since<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it would get out of hand."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I guess it would… By the way, do you think you're getting anything from a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certain someone?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No idea. At least, I haven't seen any indication that I might."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was giving chocolates to the girls but not the guys, so Amane didn't expect that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was going to give him any. Of course, he would feel grateful if she did give him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some, but he was fine either way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Honestly, as far as Amane was concerned, Valentine's Day was all just a big sales<p></p>
    <p></p>
    promotion cooked up by confectionery companies, so it wasn't something he really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cared about.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki chuckled at his friend's obvious disinterest. "You sure are blunt, Amane." Then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his attention turned to a particularly lively corner of the classroom. "Now, that… That's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    somethin', all right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki was gesturing toward a handsome young man with a captivating smile<p></p>
    <p></p>
    surrounded by a group of girls all jostling to hand him different bags and boxes of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chocolates.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Class hadn't even started yet, and already the bag that the boy had apparently brought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expressly as a receptacle was stuffed full of presents, undeniable proof of his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tremendous popularity.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't know whether to say 'It figures' or what."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can just feel the hatred wafting off the other guys."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The boys shooting Yuuta envious looks or staring hopelessly into the distance likely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had not received anything from anyone yet. The difference between their social<p></p>
    <p></p>
    standings was obvious.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It must be a real pain to have to carry home so much chocolate, Amane told himself,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wondering what he would even do with that much candy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Popular guys have it rough, huh? What do you think he even does with it all?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, seriously. I'm amazed he doesn't get fat. It's been like this ever since middle<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school, but his figure hasn't changed at all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can definitely tell he's a track-and-field guy. Well, at least that's a problem I won't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have to worry about."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not so fast. Chitose really outdid herself this time. You'd better prepare yourself."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whaddaya mean 'prepare myself'?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's a Russian roulette."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Knock it off. What'd she mix in?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Their exchange the previous day heavily implied that Chitose wasn't planning to make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    normal sweets, but Itsuki made it sound like she'd used some incredibly questionable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ingredients.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Let's see, one piece is a three-in-one habanero, wasabi, and hot pepper chocolate.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Another has pickled plum concentrate jelly in it. And the rest are normal chocolate."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What the hell has she created?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Apparently, she wanted to surprise you, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In a certain sense, he was surprised, but it was mostly in the about to faint sense.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Now I'm afraid to eat them."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Surrender all hope. I've already walked this thorny path."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I bet you ate them all for a laugh."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Maybe. As long as Chi makes it, I'll eat anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You two sicken me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki might put whatever Chitose offered him into his mouth without a second<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought, but Amane wasn't so trusting.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose wasn't actually all that bad at cooking; the problem was that she always got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    carried away with her next grand idea. She was perfectly capable of preparing entirely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ordinary dishes; she just chose to create culinary calamities sometimes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While her main victim was Itsuki, Amane was surprised to suddenly find himself in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the crosshairs. That said, from the way Itsuki was acting, he didn't think it could be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too terrible. There was probably nothing to worry about, despite the agonized faces<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Itsuki was making.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Still, Amane couldn't help but shake a strange feeling of melancholy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay, Amane, here you go!" Chitose said, handing him his chocolates. She had caught<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up with Amane and Itsuki in their classroom after school.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you," Amane replied somewhat reluctantly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He didn't want to seem ungrateful, though he had to admit he was a little concerned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about the chocolates she had made. He was still going to eat them all, obviously, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he wasn't looking forward to finding the super-spicy and super-sour chocolates she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apparently hidden in the batch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm sure you've heard from Itsuki, but be ready for something exciting!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't really like spicy food…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not that bad, you wuss! I taste tested everything myself. In fact, I thought the hot<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one was actually really good!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, but you like spicy stuff…," Amane moaned. "Geez…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't like spicy or sour food. It was like Chitose had gone out of her way to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    include flavors that Amane couldn't handle. On the other hand, the rest of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chocolates were sure to be really delicious, so…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, and there's also a super-sweet one and a super-bitter one mixed in."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks for the warning…," Amane groaned. It was just like Chitose to add in a few<p></p>
    <p></p>
    extra land mines at the last minute.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The super-sweet one probably featured condensed milk, while the super-bitter one<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was probably made of close to 99 percent cacao chocolate. That actually didn't sound<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too bad. Amane handled bitter foods better than most.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, this was the first time Itsuki was hearing this, and his face twitched as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    murmured, "Chi… you're unbelievable…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose continued smiling. "It'll be fine. There's even a special palate cleanser in there."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And what might that be?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, we're going now, bye-byeee." Without answering Amane's question, Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grabbed Itsuki's hand and walked off. Apparently, they had a Valentine's date to get to.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good luck, man!" Itsuki offered as he was pulled away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane let out an exhausted sigh and waved good-bye. After watching them disappear<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from sight, he pulled on his coat, thinking it was about time for him to head home, too,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and picked up his bag from the hook on the side of his desk.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane usually didn't mind being alone, but today he felt out of place among all the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lovesick boys and girls. He shouldered his bag and glanced around the room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The flurry of gift giving seemed to have finally subsided. Yuuta sat staring vacantly at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the enormous pile of presents on his desk. The other boys in the class could only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dream of such a hoard, and the bag hanging from the side of his desk was stuffed full<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of even more treasures.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could guess what was weighing on Yuuta's mind and couldn't help but feel bad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for him. He approached the other boy's desk.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Kadowaki?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm? Ah, Fujimiya. What's up?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They had been classmates for almost a year, so he remembered Amane's name, even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though Amane didn't have much of a presence in class.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had never taken the initiative to talk to Yuuta before, outside of a few group<p></p>
    <p></p>
    assignments, and the other boy seemed curious about the sudden interaction.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane responded to his confusion with an awkward smile, then undid the zipper of a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    small pocket on the front of his bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing in particular, just, here—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    From the pocket, Amane pulled out several plastic supermarket bags, folded into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    compact triangles, and tossed them to Yuuta.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had put them there and told him, "Keep a few of these in your bag. That way<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you'll have them whenever you need them." He had imagined he might use them for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    garbage or maybe in case of motion sickness, but he'd never expected them to come<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in handy like this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Looking perplexed by the strange bundles, Yuuta unfolded one of the triangles to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reveal a relatively large disposable shopping bag. The plastic didn't look particularly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    durable, but Amane decided that Yuuta would just have to manage somehow.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did I… uh… read the situation wrong?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "N-no…," Yuuta replied. "You're right on target, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Great. Well, good luck with all that." Reflecting on the many hazards of popularity,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane waved good-bye and left the classroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Later, Yuuta was spotted around the school carrying several shopping bags stuffed to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bursting.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though it was Valentine's Day, that didn't mean that there was anything special in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    air at home, and Amane went back to his apartment to relax just like always.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was too early to start making dinner, so he and Mahiru lounged beside each other<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the couch. She didn't seem excited or on edge in any way, and Amane took this as a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sign that she was definitely not planning anything special today.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He didn't mind, since he wasn't expecting anything in the first place, but couldn't quite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dispel the slight disappointment that he chalked up to his manly pride.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There was a sweet smell hanging over the school today, huh?" Amane remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It is Valentine's Day," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had heard a lot of disappointed grumbling coming from the boys in his class.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had only given chocolates to her female friends—she hadn't even handed out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    courtesy chocolates to the boys.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wondered why any of them had assumed they might receive anything in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    first place—it wasn't like they had any kind of relationship with her… but nevertheless,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they had high hopes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, Valentine's Day really only matters to the popular guys anyway. It's got nothing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to do with lackluster guys like me…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How very perceptive of you," Mahiru remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not exactly proud to say this," Amane continued unprompted, "but I've never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    received a romantic gift from anyone. Though, I did just get some Russian roulette<p></p>
    <p></p>
    courtesy chocolates from Chitose."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Russian roulette courtesy chocolates?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Apparently, mixed in among the normal chocolates are some… exciting concoctions."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was impossible to tell the super-spicy, super-sour, super-sweet, and super-bitter<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chocolates from the rest, and any one of them seemed capable of obliterating his sense<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of taste. Amane was kind of afraid to start eating at all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Another amazing creation…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I'll eat them later, but please show some sympathy if you find me rolling around<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in agony."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're going to eat them all?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The thing is… She sorta made them just for me, so I kinda feel obligated to eat them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Besides, it's not like they're poisonous or anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The chocolates might be extra stimulating, but it wasn't like they would cause him any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    real harm, and Chitose had gone out of her way to make and deliver them, so he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one hundred percent planning to eat them all with gratitude in his heart. Still, the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exciting ingredients made him rather nervous.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Is that how it is?" Mahiru muttered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it's not like I got any other chocolates, and for a loner like me, Valentine's Day<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doesn't mean much besides an excuse to eat some candy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was perfectly content with a single courtesy gift. He was already worried about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the day one month from now when he would have to repay Chitose's present and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wondered what he should get her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru simply stared at him silently.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After dinner, Amane decided to sample one of Chitose's chocolates and ended up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    facedown on his desk in agony.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose had arranged evenly spaced partitions containing twelve truffles inside the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    box. There were four varieties of "surprise" chocolate. That meant he had a one-in-three<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chance of picking something that would give his taste buds the shock of a lifetime.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Among those, the worst was sure to be the super-spicy one. Amane figured that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could handle the rest without too much trouble, but—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You found one, didn't you?" Mahiru asked in a sympathetic tone. She had been in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kitchen preparing drinks and returned to find Amane in obvious distress.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I was planning to eat them all over a few days, and this is what I get…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane quickly quaffed his drink, but the inside of his mouth was beyond hot. This<p></p>
    <p></p>
    went beyond having a low tolerance for spicy food—he was in real pain here. It wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more than he could handle, but it was still pretty intense.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As the characteristically sharp sting of wasabi shot through his nose, Amane found<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself thinking how impressive it was that Chitose had managed to include so much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of the volatile component. He cursed her name while trying to hold back the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    instinctive tears.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The wasabi attacked his nose and eyes, while the habanero powder and hot pepper<p></p>
    <p></p>
    burned his tongue. A single nibble of these intense flavors—or rather, intense<p></p>
    <p></p>
    torments—was enough to ruin him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My condolences," Mahiru said. "But think of it this way—if you make it through hell<p></p>
    <p></p>
    first, the rest will be heaven."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Easy for her to say. Amane was still in agony. He heard a soft sigh and then the sound<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of something hard being set down beside him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here, this should help."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he raised his head, there was a mug beside him, filled with a dark-brown liquid,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    giving off steam and a sweet aroma.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Cocoa?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Something like that. It's called chocolat chaud. It's French hot chocolate. I made it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fairly sweet. It should help cleanse your palate."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm saved…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Right now, the only thing Amane wanted to do was to wash away this pain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane tipped the contents of the mug into his mouth, a rich flavor enveloped his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    senses. The liquid had the luscious fragrance of full-bodied chocolate but was actually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not that sweet. It tasted like dark chocolate and possessed a calming flavor that went<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down very easily.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's great."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm glad to hear it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane slowly sipped the hot chocolate, attempting to soothe the pain in his mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The truffle hadn't actually contained very much of the spicy mixture. It had mostly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been ganache coated in a thick layer of chocolate and covered in powdered sugar. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    weaponized sweet packed a big kick up front, but the impact faded as time went on.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    By the time Amane had drained his mug, he was left with only a slight tingle on his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tongue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sigh… She really outdid herself…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Was it really that spicy?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, it had pepper and wasabi and habanero in it, so yeah. Damn… I'm glad you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    made that palate cleanser, but I think I would've died if I ate any more."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I suppose there's no harm done."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good grief."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even as he cursed Chitose's name under his breath, he knew that she had tried in her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    own way to surprise him, so he couldn't really be upset with her. All the chocolates<p></p>
    <p></p>
    besides the special four probably tasted normal, so it wasn't like there was any malice<p></p>
    <p></p>
    behind it. And she had even tried all the exotic ingredients herself. Amane could do<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nothing but smile bitterly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Anyway, the hot chocolate was a nice surprise. Usually you stick to hot milk, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yes, well…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did you decide to make this because it's Valentine's Day?" Amane asked hopefully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru basically always drank hot milk or milk tea, so the cocoa was unexpected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Maybe."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, thank you. You're a lifesaver."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru responded with a small nod, and Amane breathed a quiet sigh of relief.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had gone out on a limb there, and if she had shot him down, he would have looked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like a real idiot. But apparently, he'd been right on the money. Mahiru had wanted to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    do something special for Valentine's Day after all. Amane was sure there wasn't any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    deeper meaning to it than that, but he was still grateful.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It was delicious," he said again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed uncomfortable.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is something the matter?" he prodded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Um, well—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane knew that sitting beside her and pressing her for an answer would probably<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just make it harder for her to tell him, so he tried to be patient and listen instead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru hugged one of the pillows over half her face as she stared up at him anxiously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She looked like a small and strangely adorable animal, which made Amane want to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smile and reach out and pat her on the head. He continued waiting, but instead of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    continuing her thought, Mahiru simply trembled silently.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Then she stood up suddenly and grabbed her bags.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm… going home."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    By the time Amane let out a noise of surprise, Mahiru had already slipped out of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    living room. He was frozen in place as he listened to the sound of her receding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    footsteps, then the front door opening and closing, and finally the sound of the lock<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turning. In a flash, Mahiru was gone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He couldn't help letting out a confused noise at this quick work. "Eh…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Did I do something wrong…?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His heart was torn between surprise at her unexpected departure and worry that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had inadvertently driven her away. He stood up, thinking about what he should do if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was still in a bad mood when he saw her tomorrow, and went to check the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    front door. Suddenly, he caught sight of a light-pink paper bag hanging from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doorknob of his room. Mahiru must have left it there.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Inside the bag was a pastel-pink box tied with a chocolate-colored ribbon, and there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was a card affixed to the front with a sticker. The handwriting was smooth and neat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thank you for always being there for me. Please accept this with my gratitude.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane realized why she had left the bag there. Just handing it to him would have been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too awkward, especially after she had decided not to give chocolate to any other boys.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She could have just given it to me…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Smiling gently at how surprisingly timid Mahiru could be in these sorts of situations,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sat back down on the sofa and examined the contents of the bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The adorable wrapping paper reminded him of Mahiru's sophisticated yet feminine<p></p>
    <p></p>
    style.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane figured it was all right for him to go ahead and open it, and with some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apprehension, he slowly unwrapped the box.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Inside were candied orange rings dipped in chocolate, each individually wrapped in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    plastic—in other words, orangettes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The contrast between the bright color and the deep luster of the chocolate was dazzling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to the eye, and the box even included a few with white chocolate coating, and some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    used lemon peels instead of oranges. They looked delicious, and Amane appreciated<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the variety.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was a second card accompanying the Orangettes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    You don't seem to like sweet things too much, so I made you something that I thought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would better suit your tastes. I hope you like it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He recalled a conversation from about ten days earlier.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What kind do you like?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not really into sweet things, so… something not too sweet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, Mahiru had remembered his conversation with Chitose perfectly and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    picked something that would match his tastes. Amane suddenly felt very self-conscious.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hadn't expected to receive anything at all, and here she had selected something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    especially for him. It was typical of the sensitive, considerate Mahiru. Amane could feel<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself starting to blush just thinking about it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He reached down and picked up one of the orangettes, appreciating the beautiful<p></p>
    <p></p>
    colors as he unwrapped the candy and slowly took a bite. The sugary and astringent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bite of the candied orange peel melded perfectly with the pleasantly bitter chocolate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in his mouth, each flavor complimenting the other in a splendid harmony.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …So good…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane marveled at how Mahiru's handmade confections were much better than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anything he'd ever gotten from the store as he took another bite.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's orangettes were a little sour, a little bitter—and intensely sweet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, Fujimiya, thanks for yesterday."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The following morning, Yuuta casually approached Amane at school. He seemed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cheerful and friendly, but Amane couldn't help but feel nervous talking to him. Even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though they had briefly spoken the day before, Amane never would have expected him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to go out of his way to come say thanks just for that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A few people shot them curious glances, which only made Amane even more nervous.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He didn't like being the center of attention.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, don't worry about it. You looked like you were having a hard time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, yeah…" Yuuta got a faraway look in his eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I bet being a popular guy is really tough, huh?" Amane tried to sympathize.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Yuuta was clearly aware of his popularity, but it wasn't the kind of thing he would ever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    flaunt. That was part of why everybody liked him—and why even the most jealous<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boys couldn't bring themselves to truly hate him. He was the kind of guy who would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    come over and thank you for something as trivial as a plastic bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Anyway, it was a big help. Just wanted to say thanks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't mention it. Glad I could help a guy in need."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hadn't offered to help so that Yuuta would owe him or anything. Amane smiled to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    show that he thought it was no big deal, and Yuuta smiled back, looking relieved. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girls in the class all squealed. Amane couldn't help but laugh bitterly as he wished that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Yuuta would save his smile for his admirers.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What did you do for Yuuta?" Itsuki asked after Yuuta left. Apparently, he had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    watching the exchange.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Kadowaki had too much chocolate, so I gave him a couple plastic bags."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah. So he ended up with more than he expected. Shoulda come prepared." Itsuki<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smiled sympathetically.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The two of them had watched Yuuta pile up the presents and agreed that he would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably have a hard time making it home with the whole score. Itsuki wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    surprised that Amane had decided to help out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As far as Amane was concerned, it was really just a small gesture. Nothing worth going<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out of your way to say thank you for.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that's all it was. Nothing too important."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's just like you, man… But wait, you're keeping a bunch of old plastic bags<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around? Aren't you getting a little too engrossed in the domestic life? When I saw you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    scanning grocery store ads on your phone, I thought you were somebody's housewife."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, whose wife is that supposed to be? Last time I checked, I was still a man. Though,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'll admit that maybe I've been heavily influenced by you-know-who…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without a doubt, he could say it was all Mahiru's fault. The two of them were splitting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    food expenses, so he had been checking online ads, thinking he had better get the best<p></p>
    <p></p>
    deals he could, then suggesting things they could make from whatever was on sale.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, that reminded Itsuki more of a housewife than a husband. Though he did<p></p>
    <p></p>
    leave the cooking entirely up to Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Must be nice to have a partner to play house."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She's not really my partner. And what about Chitose?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Chi? Well, sure. So long as I can keep her from getting carried away with her weird<p></p>
    <p></p>
    experiments anyway. I mean, she knows how to cook, for sure."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Does she ever make anything that's not weird?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's just part of her charm, all right?" Itsuki's eyes darted from side to side.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whatever you need to tell yourself, man."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For better or worse, there was rarely a dull moment with Chitose. She might've looked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like an ordinary high school girl, and apparently she even had some surprising talents<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the home front, but when the mood struck her, she was liable to cause all sorts of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    trouble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it sounds like she's going to get it together after we're married, so—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How long do you think it's going to take to get your dad to accept her…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki's father, who was oddly strict about dating in a way that you didn't see much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    these days, had never approved of Chitose. He would definitely have something to say<p></p>
    <p></p>
    if he heard that they were planning to get married.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose's parents, on the other hand, were apparently ready to welcome Itsuki into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the family at any time, which always confused Amane… Wasn't it usually the other way<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, once we're adults, he'll have to come around. I'll threaten him with not seeing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his grandkids and all that. This is one fight where I can't back down and just do what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    my dad wants."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki made a show of shrugging like he didn't think much of it, but Amane noticed the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    serious look in his eyes. He was obviously not planning to budge on this issue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had always understood the extent to which Itsuki loved Chitose, so he chose to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    encourage them, admiring how amazing it was that they were thinking about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    marriage even while they were still in high school.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, I think you're probably not one to back down until you've got a ring on her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    finger, so I wish you the best of luck."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah. And good luck to you, too," Itsuki replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "At what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, with you-know-who… Right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I don't really have that kind of relationship with her. Don't make things up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane turned away sharply, but he could hear Itsuki's bright, cheerful laughter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane purchased everything he needed at the supermarket and headed home. When<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he got there, Mahiru was already in his apartment, sitting on the sofa, waiting in her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    usual spot. She had her knees pulled up and was squeezing a cushion to her chest. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    position made her look a little childish, but her expression wasn't sulky or dour.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Rather, she looked embarrassed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Well, thank goodness she's wearing a long skirt, Amane thought as he carefully averted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his eyes and went to put the dinner ingredients away in the refrigerator. When he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    returned to the living room, Mahiru was still sitting there waiting for him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane sat down next to her, Mahiru carefully averted her eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, thank you for the gift yesterday. It was really delicious."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm glad to hear it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought that if she was nervous about what happened yesterday, the best thing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to do was to show her how much he appreciated it. Mahiru continued squeezing the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cushion but didn't say anything else.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What would you like in return?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not why I gave it to you…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know that, but well, give a favor, get a favor, right? It wouldn't be very gentlemanly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of me if all I do is take, take, take."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane believed that a man should always strive to pay back whatever he received.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Mahiru had gone out of her way to make him such delicious treats, he intended<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to give her something equally splendid in return. She hadn't made chocolates for any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    other boy, after all, yet she had made something special that she knew he would like.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It must have been a lot of work, all for his sake.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I already get so many things from you, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Actually, I'm pretty sure I'm the one who's been on the receiving end. You're always<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooking for me and stuff. I always feel like I'm just taking advantage of you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I do those things because I like doing them. Amane, you probably don't even realize<p></p>
    <p></p>
    how much you've done for me. But as far as I'm concerned, I've already received more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than enough, so I don't need anything else."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane genuinely could not imagine what he might have offered Mahiru. It seemed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like she was always doing things for him, and he wanted to pay her back for all her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kindness… but the tally was apparently very different from Mahiru's perspective.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that is that, and this is this. I'll try to think of something you might like."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No matter what Amane might have done for her until now, he still wanted to get her a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    White Day present. It was tradition to repay any Valentine's Day chocolates on White<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Day, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane stared firmly at Mahiru, indicating that he had no intention of giving in on this,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    until she nodded, her eyes wandering around the room a bit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Fine."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, so I've got about a month to figure out what to give you. It would be great if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I could find something that you would really like."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Do you have time for a search like that?" Mahiru asked, sounding slightly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exasperated. "Next week we have final exams, and then right after, there's the closing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ceremony."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sure enough, finals were only days away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There had still been a lingering aftertaste of Valentine's Day at school that day, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    soon it would be replaced with the typical prickly energy of pre-exam anxiety.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't particularly nervous about it, though.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If the exams go the same as usual," he said, "I'm sure I'll pass, so I'm not going to stress<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about them now. Same for you, I bet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's true," Mahiru replied. "I make a point to get my work done with time to spare."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was always diligent when it came to keeping up with his classwork, so he rarely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had any trouble with tests. He knew he could maintain his usual grades without any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    last-minute cram sessions. At most, he might spend a little extra time reviewing the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    material right before each test.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had actually already completed all the coursework in advance, and she was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just as diligent about studying as Amane was, so he had never seen her panic about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    schoolwork. Instead, exam days with their shortened schedules were probably like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    half days for her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, don't expect too much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Okay. I'll treasure anything you give me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, don't get carried away now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I've been taking very good care of Mr. Bear."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm glad to hear it." Amane smiled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, Mahiru really treasured the stuffed bear he had given her on her birthday.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had also seen her using the key holder, and she seemed to be taking good care of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that as well. He had worried a little bit about how the stuffed bear was faring, but…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from all indications, Mahiru really liked it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could feel his mouth curling up into a grin when he heard Mahiru cutely refer<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to Mr. Bear, but he thought she might scowl at him if she caught him smiling, so he put<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on his best poker face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If we're still hanging out when her next birthday rolls around, what sort of thing can I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    give her…? he wondered anxiously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Suddenly, Amane noticed that Mahiru was staring at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Come to think of it, I don't know when your birthday is," she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, mine? Mine is November eighth."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Guess I never told her, huh?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When she heard his birthday, Mahiru's eyes narrowed… ever so slightly. They had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    spending a lot of time together for several months, so he had come to understand that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression as the one she made when she was angry or annoyed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Hey, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Didn't we already know each other by then?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I guess so."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why didn't you say anything?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Because you never asked. You didn't tell me your birthday, either, remember? I only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    knew because I saw it on your school ID."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Urk—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And we weren't that close back then anyway. If I had told you my birthday, you would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have wondered why in the world I was bringing it up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Also, Amane hadn't wanted to come across like he was fishing for a present or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anything. That would not have been a good look. So he hadn't seen the need to tell her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about his birthday—they hadn't had that kind of relationship back then.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…But—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really don't have to worry about it," Amane insisted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fine…," Mahiru said. "But we'll definitely celebrate your birthday properly this year."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As she said that, she turned to him and grasped his sleeve tightly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru obviously didn't want this unequal situation to continue. He had never seen<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone so serious about a birthday before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't help but grin—not his normal, wry smirk, but an honest, happy smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After all, nothing could make him happier than hearing that Mahiru felt the same way<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he did… and that she was thinking about spending time together in the future.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So you're planning to stay with me at least that long, are you?" he prodded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's bright, caramel-coloured eyes went wide—and then, in an instant, her face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    flushed red, and where she had been gripping his sleeve a moment ago, she whacked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him with the cushion, obviously trying to hide her embarrassment. Amane could feel<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself smiling again at how charming she was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, I suppose I don't hate the thought… I always feel so calm when we're together.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It's nice."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh really? Thanks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But you know I don't really… have any other intentions."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I knew that already." Amane nodded. "And that's fine with me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For some reason, Mahiru looked slightly disappointed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    
    22 White Day<p></p>
    Amane was always diligent with his studies and serious about his lessons, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    completed his final exams without any particular difficulty.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Going over his tests with Mahiru, he found that he'd gotten the same grades as usual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He always did well enough at school and never had to worry about being held back a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grade or anything like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki also got fairly good scores, and even Chitose had apparently done well enough<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to avoid a failing mark, so the people Amane was closest to were in no danger of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    repeating a year, either.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    All that was left was the graduation ceremony to send off the third-year students, which<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't have much to do with them, and after that, to wait for the closing ceremony.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Between the two ceremonies, however, was one very important date.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What do I give her?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The day was fast approaching for all those who had prevailed on Valentine's Day to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    repay their gifts. Both Mahiru and Chitose had given Amane chocolates, so naturally<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was planning to give them each something in return. The only problem was that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had no idea what to give Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose's gift was easy enough—he planned to combine a White Day cake from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    store where she had purchased their Christmas cake with a sundry of merchandise<p></p>
    <p></p>
    based on the characters she liked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was sure that someone like Chitose, who was more interested in sweets than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sweethearts, would appreciate that. It was an obvious choice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But Mahiru remained a dilemma.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was sure that Mahiru would graciously accept anything he got her—the thought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mattered more to her than the actual gift. But he wanted to pick out something that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would make her really happy. The trouble was that he honestly didn't know much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about the kinds of things she liked. He knew she had a taste for sweets and liked cute<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stuff like most other girls, but beyond that, he was lost. Mahiru was not an easy person<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to shop for.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane remembered her telling him that she wanted a new whetstone, but that didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seem like a particularly charming gift, and he couldn't really afford something like that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anyway. And for this occasion, it seemed more appropriate to give her something she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would enjoy, rather than something practical.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane started his search by looking over the White Day display at a nearby department<p></p>
    <p></p>
    store, but he couldn't picture Mahiru being truly happy with any of the things there.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was hoping for a reaction like he'd gotten when he'd given her the stuffed bear.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, it would be boring to give her a stuffed animal a second time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There were many adorable stuffed animals on display, but Amane decided that a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    repeat gift lacked originality.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    On the other hand, when he tried to imagine what would impress her, Amane's poor<p></p>
    <p></p>
    imagination could only come up with cosmetics or fashion accessories.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But he knew less than nothing about cosmetics, and he wasn't sure whether they had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the kind of relationship where he could confidently pick out fashionable things for her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He didn't think she would interpret it as anything strange, but he wasn't sure it would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really impress her, either.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought that their relationship was pretty good, and if he were Itsuki and she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were Chitose, an accessory would be an obvious choice, but Amane just didn't think it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was the right move here.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Racked with worry, Amane lingered restlessly by the gifts corner. He imagined that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    must look awfully suspicious. Even though he had taken the precaution of dressing up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to go out, he thought that a single guy hanging around the cute goods had to seem<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shady.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was grumbling to himself about his options, when from behind him a voice asked,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you looking for anything in particular?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane turned around, there was a young woman in a store apron standing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there smiling. She had probably noticed his distress as he helplessly wandered the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    aisles.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, um… I'm not sure what to get for a White Day present."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So nothing in the display jumps out at you? Well, there are some things in our regular<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stock that are also popular White Day gifts. Let me show you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, no, that's not exactly it… You see, our relationship is rather hard to define, and I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not sure what I can get her that won't be… too much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Meaning what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, she's not my girlfriend, but we are pretty close, so… this is just an example, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'm wondering whether she would be happy to get an accessory or something from a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    guy she doesn't like… that way."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane explained his predicament, the store clerk let a little giggle slip out. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed to find his dilemma quite charming.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I've seen a lot of gentlemen come through here with the same sort of worries."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So what did they end up doing?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "They were all worried, too, but most of them decided to buy something. If you're close<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to this girl, she'll probably appreciate anything you give her."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt relieved to hear someone else say that, though of course the prospect of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    picking an accessory for Mahiru was still fairly daunting.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was very particular about her attire, and the bits and pieces he had seen her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wearing before had all been quite elegant. Amane had no confidence that he could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    select something that would meet the standards of such a sophisticated young woman.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sir, would you like me to show you some of the items in the corner over there that are<p></p>
    <p></p>
    popular with our female customers?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yes, please," Amane said gratefully, straightening up a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And so you bought something?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane told Itsuki about his shopping trip, his friend looked at him and laughed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pretty much the same way the clerk had the day before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The two of them were eating lunch together in the cafeteria, and when the topic of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    White Day came up, Amane had spilled the beans.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Geez, keep it down!" Amane insisted. "Anyway, I was worried that giving her an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    accessory might weird her out, since we're not dating."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're such a coward! A man should have more nerve, more spirit! And anyway, I have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a feeling that she'll be happy with anything as long as it comes from you, ya know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I guess so, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was the kind of girl who would graciously accept any gift, but Amane wanted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to give her a present that she would genuinely enjoy and want to use, so he had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stressing out trying to choose something good.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So what did you end up buying?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…A rose-gold bracelet with a flower pattern."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had thought that the soft warmth of the rose gold would suit her better than
    <p></p>
    cool-looking silver or extravagant yellow gold. Of course, he was just in high school, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couldn't afford real precious metals, so it was only gold-plated, but he had been careful<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to select a design that seemed to suit Mahiru's style.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Really? That seems like exactly the kind of thing she'll like, man."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…She won't be weirded out?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way; you're worrying too much. Why are you always so negative about this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stuff…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She's the only girl I've ever seriously thought about giving a present to."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother didn't count, and he wasn't thinking of Chitose, either. And anyway, he'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    only gotten Chitose a confection that he already knew she liked, so that present felt<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like it was on a different level.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really don't have any confidence with this stuff, huh…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And why should I? I mean… it's Mahiru!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She was happy with the teddy bear, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that's true, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, it's all about feeling, man, feeling. You've already spent the cash and chosen<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the gift, so all that's left now is to put some emotion behind it." Itsuki made it sound<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so simple.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If it was that easy," Amane grumbled, "I wouldn't have any problem." He pressed a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hand to his forehead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It seemed he would be plagued with doubt over his decision until White Day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When the fateful day arrived, Amane was waiting for Mahiru in his apartment, wearing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an unusually nervous expression. The mood at school had reminded him of Valentine's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Day. The boys who had come out on top a month earlier were anxious about giving<p></p>
    <p></p>
    their return gifts, and the girls were waiting with barely contained anticipation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Incidentally, Yuuta had faithfully returned each and every gift, repaying each one with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an identical box of sweets. Amane's eyes glazed over when he considered that even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doing the very minimum must have cost Yuuta tens of thousands of yen.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In any case, there was no way that Amane would have given Mahiru his present at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school, so now he waited for her to arrive at his apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had rushed home from school to compose himself, but try as he might, he was just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not used to giving gifts. His nerves were threatening to get the better of him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just this once, he wasn't wearing his usual sweatpants and T-shirt, but rather a layered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    outfit with a gray V-neck sweater over a white shirt, paired with chino pants. He'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tried to look a little less sloppy than usual, but he wasn't entirely sure how his new<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look would be received.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was still struggling to get ahold of himself when he heard the sound of the front<p></p>
    <p></p>
    door unlocking. He sat bolt upright, startled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was Mahiru, using her duplicate key, as usual. When she came into the living room,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she looked at Amane and froze.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, wh-why is your hair like that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, uh, it is White Day, ya know, and I wanted to dress up a little, so I thought I had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    better try to clean up my act today… If you don't like it, I can go fix it, though."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd obviously succeeded in surprising Mahiru, and she didn't seem to be taking it too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    well—but when he stood up, she waved a hand in front of her face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Th-that's not what I meant. I was just surprised, is all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I see."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could tell that something was up with Mahiru. He was starting to think he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    should have stuck to his usual getup.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was fidgeting as she took a seat beside him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You still look uncomfortable. Should I go change?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "N-no, it's fine, it's just… It's a lot."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What do you mean?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "W-well, you're always so low-key. I feel like I can relax around you. But… when you're<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all done up like that, it makes it hard to stay calm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "In that case, I'll take it off."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru grasped his sleeve tightly. "…I said it's fine."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When she looked up at him with dewy eyes and flushed cheeks, Amane felt his heart<p></p>
    <p></p>
    leap in his chest. He knew she wasn't doing it on purpose, but she was really making<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it hard for him to maintain his composure. It didn't help that she was close enough<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he could smell her sweet perfume.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was incredibly aware of the way she was fidgeting restlessly and how tightly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was holding on to him. Now both of them were blushing, and it made the situation<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even more uncomfortable.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's eyes darted restlessly around the room. "Well, uh, okay," he stammered. Then,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in an effort to move past the awkward moment, he gracelessly thrust a paper bag<p></p>
    <p></p>
    toward Mahiru. "Here. It's your gift. Don't expect too much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you. May I open it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It would be embarrassing for her to open it right in front of him, but he wasn't going<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to say no. Amane had purchased a small box lined with velvet to hold the bracelet, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    now he worried that it was too much for the gift he'd chosen.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's slender white fingers gently opened the dark-blue box. Inside was the rose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gold bracelet he had purchased the other day, as well as some folded paper he had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    included as a bonus.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't seem to be into gaudy accessories, so he had emphasized elegance and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    simplicity when choosing the flower bracelet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Here and there it was decorated with sparkling glass crystals that caught the light and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    glittered. The design was both cute and refined.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's caramel-coloured eyes gazed for a long time at the brilliance of the rose-gold<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bracelet in the box.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't like it…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I think it's lovely."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's a relief. I picked that because I thought it would look good on you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you very much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes were downcast, as though she was embarrassed by what he had said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Watching her, Amane felt his breath catch in his throat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…And this is?" Mahiru asked, noticing the paper he had included in the box.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wanted to look away, but he couldn't take his eyes off Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, that?" Amane scratched his cheek in embarrassment. "Well, um, I kinda thought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the bracelet wasn't enough somehow, so… You're always taking care of me, and um, I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want to be able to grant any requests you might have, so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The paper he had put in the box as a bonus gift was a booklet of I'll do anything you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    say tickets, like the kind a small child might make. The bunch of tickets was good for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    three uses and featured a hand-drawn illustration of a bear. Amane thought it had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turned out rather well, given his skills anyway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Mahiru was always looking after him, he wanted to do what he could to help her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out whenever she might need it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was the idea behind the coupons anyway, but Mahiru seemed more focused on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the illustrated bear. Her shoulders trembled with laughter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Pfft-ha-ha, did you draw this yourself, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh hush," Amane said sullenly. "I'm no artist. So what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I think it's great. You chose it for a reason." Mahiru's innocent smile made it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    obvious that she hadn't really meant to criticize. "…So can I use them right away?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "On what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hadn't expected her to want to exercise her privilege so suddenly, but if Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had a favor that she wanted to ask of him, he intended to grant her request to the very<p></p>
    <p></p>
    best of his ability.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru gently turned the box containing the bracelet around to face him. "…Amane,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    please help me put this on."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, come on, you don't need a ticket to ask me that," he said with a troubled smile as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he listened to her modest request. "Now, if the lady would allow me to assist…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru held out the box, and his expression softened when he saw how cute she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked. After he took the box from her, he set it down on his knees and removed the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bracelet, noting the smooth sound of the delicate chain sliding across the velvet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Gingerly, he opened the clasp and gently wound the chain around her wrist. Finally, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    carefully fastened it back together. The warm rose gold sparkled on Mahiru's delicate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wrist.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I was right, this color does suit Mahiru's light skin.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since hers was a refined sort of beauty, Amane had guessed that something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    conservative and elegant would suit her better than something flashy, and he felt a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    surge of pride when he realized that he had made the correct selection.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, that looks good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thinking it wouldn't do to hold on to her for too long, he let go of her hand, and Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brought the arm bearing the bracelet up to her chest, holding it gently, and smiled<p></p>
    <p></p>
    softly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That sweet, unabashed smile, the soft shape of Mahiru's lips, the slight flush on her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    innocent cheeks… It was both childish and womanly, guileless and refined. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    found he couldn't turn away from her, no matter how hard he tried.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …This is too much…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Knowing that he was the reason for Mahiru's smile was almost more than he could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stand. Amane tried to tear his eyes away and bring his soaring heart back down to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    earth, but in the end, he kept staring at her until she noticed and hid her face in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cushion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So how was White Day?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The following day Itsuki asked him for a report. Amane did his best to give him a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    humorless scowl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki had been considerate enough not to ask while they were in school, but on the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    way home, they stopped at a fast-food joint, and the moment they sat down, he began<p></p>
    <p></p>
    digging for details with a grin.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had only come to eat some fries because he was craving something salty.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now he thought it probably would have been better not to come if he was going to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have to put up with this kind of questioning.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What's there to tell…? I just gave her the bracelet like normal."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And was she happy to get it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…More or less," Amane answered in the calmest voice he could muster.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    True, he hadn't gotten quite the reaction he'd been expecting, but judging by her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    earnest smile, he was sure she'd been happy with the gift.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt a little uncomfortable just recalling that sweet, beautiful smile. He tried to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    suppress the warmth creeping onto his face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure, sure." Itsuki folded his arms and nodded knowingly. "I can tell from your reaction<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that it went over really well. She was definitely happy to get the gift, and she smiled at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you really cute-like, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean—" Amane bit his lip.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look, man. You're building a solid connection, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Rather than teasing him, Itsuki was speaking earnestly and in a serious tone. Itsuki<p></p>
    <p></p>
    never intruded in certain areas that, as Amane's best friend, he knew better than to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    touch. But aside from those topics, he had an uncanny knack for pointing out the truth,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so much that it was sometimes uncomfortable. Amane had no recourse—Itsuki's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relationship was too well established to make good conversation material at this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    point, so changing the subject was near impossible.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane choked on his words, and Itsuki smiled at him calmly. The somewhat warm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look in his eyes irritated Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Seeing there was no use fighting back, Amane snatched a french fry and stubbornly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki smiled teasingly at his friend. "I'm happy for you, man. Finally, my little Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is starting the springtime of his youth!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not what's happening."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But you don't know for sure how she feels about it, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Even so, I'm sure it's not like that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Certainly, he knew from firsthand experience that Mahiru trusted him deeply. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wanted to be the person she trusted the most, in fact, and out of everyone she knew<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in school, he believed that she was the most honest with him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But that didn't mean they were in love or anything.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sure, sometimes when they touched, it felt a little… intense. But that wasn't uncommon<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with opposite-sex friendships. And okay, Mahiru did do a lot for him, but he was sure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that didn't mean she had romantic feelings for him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    And yes, recently Amane had been spending a little more effort on his appearance. But<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was still the same hopeless loser he'd always been. There was no way that a girl<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like Mahiru would fall for a guy like him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You know, Amane, you can be pretty pathetic sometimes. Seriously, you're the kind of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    guy who acts like nobody will ever love him."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really think that all it takes for a guy like me to get an amazing girlfriend is a little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hard work? I'd have better luck waiting on a miracle…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If all the beautiful girls were snapped up by only the most handsome, charming young<p></p>
    <p></p>
    men of the world, the guys who missed out might go down a violent path, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't sure Itsuki had a right to comment, as a member of the former group.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki continued, "Anyway, if you insist, we'll leave it at that for now… More importantly,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it's time for me to make a prediction as your best friend."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "About what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sooner or later, you're gonna change. I can already see the telltale signs. All that's left<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is for you to take the first steps toward your new future."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Don't talk like some kind of know-it-all guru," Amane said with a scowl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ha-ha-ha! How long have we been friends?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It hasn't even been a year," Amane quipped coolly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh yeah, that's right!" Itsuki roared with laughter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The two of them had only known each other since the start of high school, but Itsuki<p></p>
    <p></p>
    understood Amane much better than the guys he'd known in elementary and middle<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school back home. He was glad that the two of them got along so easily.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Anyway—," Itsuki continued.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You keep going on and on about how you're not worthy of her, but your attitude and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the way you talk about her just proves that you actually do like her."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I will stick this french fry right up your nose," Amane threatened.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry," Itsuki instantly apologized.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane came very close to actually being impressed by what his friend had to say only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for Itsuki to ruin it right at the end with a ridiculous comment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're late today."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane returned home about an hour later than usual, Mahiru came out to greet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him in her apron. After his earlier conversation with Itsuki, Amane couldn't help but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    think that she looked like a newlywed. He told himself that he didn't feel that way<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about her, so it wasn't fair to indulge in that delusion, and he drove the thought from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his mind in a bit of a panic.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm, I had fries with Itsuki."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Right before dinner?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't worry, I'll finish my plate."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had a second stomach for Mahiru's cooking, and he had been conservative and only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had a small order of fries anyway, so he had plenty of room for his meal, even if Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dished up his usual serving size.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For a second, I worried about you gaining weight…," Mahiru mused. "But you're so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slim that you could probably stand to put on a little bit more meat."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're one to talk. I'm always worried you might snap in half one day."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not that fragile, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh really? Look at how thin you are."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had a very slender and feminine physique. Of course, she did quite a few<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sports, so she wasn't just thin, she was also toned and flexible. Still, she had a delicate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look to her for some reason, and just as a test, he reached out and grabbed her wrist,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    easily wrapping his fingers all the way around. He remembered his father warning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him to always treat a lady gently and with care.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She seemed so dainty and thin, he thought, as he moved his fingers along hers, feeling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the delicate bones beneath her skin.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru squirmed uncomfortably. He saw she was staring at her hand in his, her cheeks<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slightly flushed, and realized much too late that he had been touching her without her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    permission.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In a panic, Amane released Mahiru's hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry. I should've known you wouldn't like that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's… Well… I don't hate it when you touch me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane stared at Mahiru in shock. He could barely believe his own ears. Mahiru also<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed to realize what exactly she had said and looked up suddenly, cheeks redder than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had ever seen them, eyes beginning to fill with tears. Amane felt like he couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    possibly bear the embarrassment a moment longer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Th-that doesn't mean that I'm asking you to touch me or anything, all right?" Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    explained. "Just that I hate it when other guys touch me. You understand?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yeah," Amane said meekly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, his heart was still pounding wildly. The very particular phrasing she had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    used left an awful lot open to interpretation. He felt like he needed to change the subject.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Oh, um, I noticed…," he mumbled, "you're not wearing the bracelet I gave you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    yesterday. I mean, obviously you don't have to wear it if you don't want…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked down at her wrist and with one finger softly traced the place where<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had grasped her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…If I wear it when I'm doing housework, it gets in the way, and it'll get damaged<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sooner… I want to keep it nice, so I'll wear it on my days off."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I see."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could not imagine a more perfect answer. She had told him both that she was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    going to treasure the gift and that she was intending to wear it regularly. His legs<p></p>
    <p></p>
    threatened to give out on the spot, and his chest felt like it might burst with all the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feelings bubbling up inside him, and in the heat of the moment, he was sure there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't a man alive who would have felt any different.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Somewhere in this dizzy state of mind, Amane realized how loudly his heart was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thumping. He took several long, slow breaths to try to calm down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…As long as you like it, I'm happy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I do, and I'm going to take good care of it. Like I do with all of them—the teddy bear,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the key holder, and the bracelet. I'm going to use the hand cream without reservation,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though." Mahiru smiled slightly, looking embarrassed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could not take it a moment longer. He quickly kicked off his shoes and darted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down the hallway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm going to change clothes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "O-okay. See you when you get back, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though he had come home to his own single apartment, Amane felt like he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    being sent off by his new wife. His heart began to pound violently again, and he rushed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into his bedroom and promptly collapsed on the floor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    <br>
<br>
This is worse than I expected…<br>
<br>
Amane stifled a yawn as he watched the distant figure of the school principal up on<br>
<br>
the stage, giving a stern address. He didn't really care about closing ceremonies or<br>
<br>
whatever speech the principal had prepared for the occasion. Frankly, he would have<br>
<br>
rather been napping.<br>
<br>
Most of the students around him seemed to share that sentiment. Very few people<br>
<br>
were actually paying much attention. Everybody else was obviously zoning out.<br>
<br>
Still, it wasn't like the students could flaunt their boredom, so Amane put on a serious<br>
<br>
expression and silently wished for a speedy end to the proceedings as he let the<br>
<br>
principal's speech flow in one ear and out the other, the minutes slipping past as he<br>
<br>
pretended to be a model student.<br>
<br>
He might have cared about graduation, but this was just the closing ceremony. It didn't<br>
<br>
really matter.<br>
<br>
"…Ah, I'm so stiff."<br>
<br>
"The principal's speeches are always so long."<br>
<br>
That was the general sentiment as the students returned to their classrooms.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, everyone sounded quite lively, probably because two weeks of freedom<br>
<br>
awaited them after this final homeroom period.<br>
<br>
From his seat, Amane watched his cheerful schoolmates who would soon be liberated<br>
<br>
from their boring classes, and he let out a quiet sigh.<br>
<br>
Spring vacation started tomorrow, but how would he spend it?<br>
<br>
He had pretty much just seen his parents, so considering how much it cost to travel,<br>
<br>
he figured he could take a pass on going home. But that left him with an empty schedule.<br>
<br>
Even if he thoroughly prepared for next year's classes, he would have a lot of time on<br>
<br>
his hands. He had considered getting a short-term job, but he hadn't managed to line<br>
<br>
up anything, and now there wasn't enough time. The only friends he had to hang out<br>
<br>
with over the break were Itsuki and Chitose.<br>
<br>
"Hey, hey, Amaneee—"<br>
<br>
Itsuki appeared just as he crossed Amane's mind.<br>
<br>
When he turned around, he saw Itsuki wearing an enthusiastic smile… and was<br>
<br>
immediately suspicious. Itsuki only smiled like that when he had a favor to ask, or<br>
<br>
when he was about to suggest something foolish.<br>
<br>
"What is it?"<br>
<br>
"Are you free starting tomorrow?"<br>
<br>
"I guess I am."<br>
<br>
"Right, right, I thought so. That's good, veeery good."<br>
<br>
Still grinning, Itsuki patted the bag that was hanging from the side of his desk. Even<br>
<br>
though everyone was supposed to have cleared out their lockers and desks the day<br>
<br>
before, Itsuki's bag was obviously packed full. They didn't even have any classes that<br>
<br>
day, so the most he could have possibly needed to bring to school would be a pen and<br>
<br>
maybe a binder, but Itsuki's bag looked like it was about to burst.<br>
<br>
"…What's all that?" Amane asked.<br>
<br>
"Change of clothes."<br>
<br>
"Why?"<br>
<br>
"'Cause I'm staying at your place…"<br>
<br>
Itsuki put on his humblest, most flattering voice and gave Amane an imploring look.<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't help but scowl back at his friend.<br>
<br>
"Hang on a sec; haven't you ever heard of giving advance notice?"<br>
<br>
"Sure I have. Consider yourself notified that I'm coming over, staying several nights,<br>
<br>
and bringing the party with me!"<br>
<br>
"What, you're gonna keep the whole neighborhood up all night? How well do you think<br>
<br>
that's gonna go over, idiot?"<br>
<br>
"Geez, dude, I was only joking… But I am serious about you letting me stay with you."<br>
<br>
Itsuki rarely failed to let Amane know ahead of time when he was coming over. The<br>
<br>
first thing that came to mind was that it was an emergency. Amane struggled to imagine<br>
<br>
what it could be about, though.<br>
<br>
"I had a fight with my dad this morning."<br>
<br>
As if to answer Amane's internal question, Itsuki readily disclosed the reason.<br>
<br>
"…About Chitose?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah. When my dad gets mad, he won't listen to me unless I leave him alone for a few<br>
<br>
days. And I've been staying at Chi's house a lot, so I'd rather not go there. No matter<br>
<br>
how accepting her parents are, it doesn't seem right, ya know?"<br>
<br>
"But you're okay staying with me?"<br>
<br>
"I thought you might let me."<br>
<br>
Itsuki probably assumed it would be no big deal. He'd stayed over at Amane's<br>
<br>
apartment plenty of times, even before Amane had cleaned up the place.<br>
<br>
And it wasn't like Amane didn't want to let his friend stay with him. But there was the<br>
<br>
issue of Mahiru. Amane was worried that he would be forcing her to stay in her public<br>
<br>
persona during a time when she wanted to relax, since he didn't think she would feel<br>
<br>
comfortable acting casually with Itsuki around.<br>
<br>
And there was another issue. Recently, he had noticed that Mahiru had been acting<br>
<br>
strangely affectionate, and he was afraid that if Itsuki saw her treating a guy that way,<br>
<br>
he would immediately get the wrong idea.<br>
<br>
"…Let me ask."<br>
<br>
Amane sent Mahiru a text message asking her what she thought. She would probably<br>
<br>
send him a memo about the shopping before going home, so he expected she would<br>
<br>
see it when she did that. It only took a moment for him to send the message, but Itsuki<br>
<br>
let out a long, drawn-out sigh.<br>
<br>
"What—are you two living together or something?"<br>
<br>
"I'll leave you on the floor with no heater or futon."<br>
<br>
"Just when I start to think you're a nice guy for letting me stay over, you go and<br>
<br>
threaten to stand by and do nothing while I freeze to death?"<br>
<br>
"Hey, you got yourself into this."<br>
<br>
Amane shot a look at Itsuki that essentially said What are you even going on about, and<br>
<br>
Itsuki could only shrug in response.<br>
<br>
I'm the one who should be shrugging. I don't want you to cause Mahiru any trouble with<br>
<br>
your usual antics.<br>
<br>
Itsuki was pretty good at reading the room, so Amane didn't think he would knowingly<br>
<br>
bother Mahiru or anything, but he wasn't looking forward to all the teasing he would<br>
<br>
have to endure the moment she wasn't around. Amane let out a sigh as Itsuki grinned<br>
<br>
at him.<br>
<br>
Apparently, Mahiru sometimes checked her phone at school, because Amane had<br>
<br>
already gotten a response: "I'll make dinner as usual if you buy enough food for three."<br>
<br>
"She said it's all right."<br>
<br>
"Yay, I get to eat Mahiru's cooking!"<br>
<br>
"That wasn't your goal all along, was it?"<br>
<br>
"Let's just say I'm not one to waste an opportunity. Besides, you're always raving about<br>
<br>
her cooking. I want to try it at least once."<br>
<br>
"…Don't you dare be a nuisance to her."<br>
<br>
"I may be a nuisance to you, but never to her."<br>
<br>
"Don't annoy me, either."<br>
<br>
Itsuki cackled, and Amane flicked him in the forehead. Though his friend yelped in<br>
<br>
pain, he still wore a giddy smile, and Amane let out another overdrawn sigh.<br>
<br>
"So how long are you planning on staying?"<br>
<br>
Amane was looking at Itsuki, who had made himself comfortable the instant they'd<br>
<br>
gotten the shopping through the door. Itsuki hadn't been coming over much lately<br>
<br>
because Mahiru was always around, but before that, he'd visited Amane's apartment<br>
<br>
often, and he obviously still felt right at home.<br>
<br>
Itsuki crossed his legs and took a sip from his cup of coffee, staring off in thought. He<br>
<br>
looked like a model in a photo shoot. "Hmm… Well, for now, why don't we say… three<br>
<br>
days, give or take. Geez, this is a real pain!"<br>
<br>
"Your dad's not a bad person, but he does seem to be pretty stuck in his ways."<br>
<br>
"The old geezer's a stubborn ass."<br>
<br>
"Come on—"<br>
<br>
"I mean, what gives him the right to tell me who I can and can't date?! Whatever; I'm<br>
<br>
moving out once I'm an adult anyway." Itsuki stuck out his tongue in a show of anger.<br>
<br>
Amane knew that Itsuki didn't actually hate his father. His old man was the kind of guy<br>
<br>
who had to have everything his way, sure, but once somebody won his affection, he<br>
<br>
always treated them well. Amane thought he was a good person at least.<br>
<br>
But Chitose had never obtained his approval. Amane thought that it probably had to<br>
<br>
do with the fact that Itsuki's family was fairly well-to-do. Itsuki's father probably<br>
<br>
wanted his son to date someone from the same social class. At the same time, Amane<br>
<br>
wondered if maybe Itsuki's father just couldn't stand Chitose's unique personality.<br>
<br>
Either way, it sounded like he had dismissed Itsuki's relationship without listening to<br>
<br>
anything Itsuki had to say. So Itsuki had declared that, if that was the case, he was<br>
<br>
leaving home.<br>
<br>
"You've got it good when it comes to parents, Amane. They let you do whatever you<br>
<br>
want."<br>
<br>
"My parents are super close, so I guess they want their son to choose a partner he<br>
<br>
likes."<br>
<br>
"I am seriously jealous of your parents."<br>
<br>
Itsuki's upbringing had been really strict, so perhaps it was only natural for him to be<br>
<br>
going through a rebellious phase. Bleaching his hair and acting like nothing ever<br>
<br>
bothered him were just other parts of his insurrection. Amane didn't think he was<br>
<br>
really in a position to criticize.<br>
<br>
"You say that, but I'm sure your parents can't be that bad."<br>
<br>
"They might be decent people, but they're awful parents. I mean, you can't just try to<br>
<br>
control your kids all the time, man. You gotta let 'em run free sometimes, 'cause if you<br>
<br>
always try to keep 'em on a leash, they're gonna bite you one day."<br>
<br>
"And you think you'd be okay, running wild all the time?"<br>
<br>
"Maybe, if they'd let me do my own thing. But instead they slapped a collar on me and<br>
<br>
put me in a cage, so all I can do is bare my fangs." Itsuki shrugged. "They've been alive<br>
<br>
for how long? You'd think they would have learned better by now." He slurped down<br>
<br>
the rest of his coffee in one go.<br>
<br>
"Well, you can relax for a few days. I mean, we're on break, so we've got nothing but<br>
<br>
time."<br>
<br>
"Friends truly are life's greatest treasure…!"<br>
<br>
"Don't cling to me like that; it's creepy."<br>
<br>
"You wound me! I demand Lady Shiina's cooking as consolation!"<br>
<br>
"As if you need an excuse to eat dinner…"<br>
<br>
"Tee-hee!"<br>
<br>
"Don't act like such a weirdo."<br>
<br>
"How cruel, to wound me yet again! Oh, boo-hoo!"<br>
<br>
Itsuki pantomimed wiping away tears, but his grin was wider than ever. Amane<br>
<br>
watched him with exasperation but also a small sense of relief.<br>
<br>
Itsuki had frequent battles with his father, but the fight this morning seemed to have<br>
<br>
gotten to him more than usual. It was obvious that he'd been putting on a brave face<br>
<br>
at school.<br>
<br>
Amane was glad to see that his friend was feeling at least a bit better. Of course, he<br>
<br>
didn't want to let on to Itsuki that he was worried about him, so he pretended to be<br>
<br>
sour even as he secretly breathed a sigh of relief.<br>
<br>
Mahiru came over to Amane's apartment sometime after sundown.<br>
<br>
She arrived empty-handed, presumably because Amane had already acquired all the<br>
<br>
ingredients she had requested.<br>
<br>
Amane had given her advance warning that his friend would be there, so she didn't<br>
<br>
seem put off by the sight of Itsuki making himself at home. In fact, Itsuki was the one<br>
<br>
who seemed slightly flustered.<br>
<br>
"It's been a while, Akazawa."<br>
<br>
"Nice to see you after so long. Sorry to suddenly barge into your love nest… Ow, owww!<br>
<br>
I get it; it was only a joke! Sorry to suddenly intrude; it must be awkward for you to<br>
<br>
have some unfamiliar guy hanging around."<br>
<br>
Amane had wordlessly stomped on Itsuki's foot, but even as he groaned in pain, he<br>
<br>
wore an amiable grin.<br>
<br>
"No, not at all," Mahiru replied. "It's fun to have such… lively people over."<br>
<br>
"Well, don't expect any peace or quiet with this guy around," Amane added.<br>
<br>
"You shouldn't say things like that," Mahiru scolded.<br>
<br>
Amane held his tongue, but Itsuki was giving him a smug look, so he pinched him on<br>
<br>
the side where Mahiru couldn't see. Unfortunately, Itsuki was in very good shape, so<br>
<br>
there weren't many places where he could find purchase with his fingers.<br>
<br>
"Well then, I'm going to go make dinner, so please relax."<br>
<br>
Mahiru ignored the boys' squabbling, flashed her angelic smile, put on her apron, and<br>
<br>
departed for the kitchen. She was obviously comfortable leaving their guest in Amane's<br>
<br>
hands.<br>
<br>
Itsuki stared at Mahiru's back as she went, still smiling smugly. "…You're close enough<br>
<br>
to give her a key to your place, huh?"<br>
<br>
"Shut up."<br>
<br>
Mahiru had let herself in with her key, rather than buzzing over the intercom. Itsuki<br>
<br>
had not failed to pick up on this sign of intimacy.<br>
<br>
"And she told me 'Please relax' like she runs the place. Honestly, she's acting like she's<br>
<br>
already your wife!"<br>
<br>
"Do you want me to kick you out?"<br>
<br>
"Okay, okay, I'm only kidding… is what I'd normally say, but you gotta understand how<br>
<br>
this looks, my man!"<br>
<br>
Amane tried to grab him by the scruff of the neck, but Itsuki twisted away. He scuttled<br>
<br>
across the carpet and booted up Amane's video game console. Amane slid off the<br>
<br>
couch and sat down next to him, making sure to give him a gentle knee in the back on<br>
<br>
the way, and the two of them killed some time playing games.<br>
<br>
Before too long, Amane started to hear the sound of Mahiru taking the dishes out. He<br>
<br>
wasn't going to make her do everything, so he stood up and headed for the kitchen.<br>
<br>
"Let me help. Can I take the dishes that are already plated?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, thank you."<br>
<br>
Amane took several plates piled with food out to the table. When he set them down,<br>
<br>
he caught Itsuki staring at him, looking dumbfounded.<br>
<br>
"…How should I put this…?"<br>
<br>
"What's up?"<br>
<br>
"Know what? I'll keep it to myself."<br>
<br>
"What the heck…," Amane muttered as Itsuki started packing away the game console.<br>
<br>
When it was time for dinner, the three of them sat down, with Mahiru's homemade<br>
<br>
dishes between them, and Itsuki wore a truly pleased expression.<br>
<br>
"So good…"<br>
<br>
"Thank you very much."<br>
<br>
Mahiru sat up straight and proper as she ate. She wore her calm, angelic smile, but<br>
<br>
since Itsuki already knew their secret, Amane could tell that she was letting herself<br>
<br>
relax a little.<br>
<br>
Itsuki looked like he was in a trance, bringing bites of food to his mouth.<br>
<br>
Amane had warned Mahiru ahead of time that Itsuki would eat more than he would,<br>
<br>
so she had prepared large portions for him, but even so, he was putting it away pretty<br>
<br>
quickly.<br>
<br>
"Wow, you're a lucky man, Amane, to be able to eat food like this every day…"<br>
<br>
"I'm all too aware of that. The food is delicious as always, by the way."<br>
<br>
"…Thank you very much."<br>
<br>
He gave Mahiru his reaction after sipping his miso soup.<br>
<br>
Amane's lips curled into a smile as he savored the taste. He couldn't help but grin at<br>
<br>
the comforting combination of dashi and miso. It was so good that he never got tired<br>
<br>
of it, even having it every day. But the person who cooked it didn't seem to realize just<br>
<br>
how sublime it was, so he always made sure to tell her.<br>
<br>
The soup had a gentle flavor that reminded Amane of her personality. It warmed him<br>
<br>
all the way down into his belly. He didn't find it at all surprising that Itsuki was<br>
<br>
entranced.<br>
<br>
"Ah, it's so good."<br>
<br>
Today Mahiru had made Amane's favorite dish, rolled omelets, so he had an even<br>
<br>
bigger appetite than usual. Of course Mahiru's food was so good that Amane always<br>
<br>
went back for seconds, but even so, his appetite was an entirely different beast when<br>
<br>
eggs were on the menu.<br>
<br>
As he was smacking his lips at the rich, comforting dishes, Itsuki kept glancing over at<br>
<br>
Amane and Mahiru. "…What a happy couple," he muttered.<br>
<br>
"Did you say something?"<br>
<br>
"Nope!" Itsuki shook his head. "Not a thing!" He returned his attention to his plate.<br>
<br>
Amane decided not to question him any further. He noticed that Mahiru was staring<br>
<br>
at him quietly and simply shrugged.<br>
<br>
After dinner, Mahiru went home early.<br>
<br>
Usually, she would stay at Amane's place until it was time to wind down, typically a bit<br>
<br>
after nine o'clock, but because Itsuki was staying over, she had decided it was best to<br>
<br>
leave a little sooner. The two of them had been left alone while Amane had done the<br>
<br>
washing up, and he wondered if that awkwardness wasn't part of the reason she'd left<br>
<br>
so soon.<br>
<br>
When Amane asked Itsuki what they had talked about, he'd said that they'd just made<br>
<br>
small talk and chatted about Chitose. Amane hadn't questioned his friend any further,<br>
<br>
but he had a suspicion that other topics had come up.<br>
<br>
"Hey, Amane?"<br>
<br>
Just before going to sleep, Itsuki looked up from where he had spread out a futon on<br>
<br>
the floor of the bedroom.<br>
<br>
"What is it?" Amane asked from his bed.<br>
<br>
"The way you look at Shiina, with those big soft eyes… You definitely have a thing for<br>
<br>
her, right?"<br>
<br>
"Shut up."<br>
<br>
"Anybody can see it, man. You're absolutely lovestruck."<br>
<br>
"Don't make me kick you out into the cold."<br>
<br>
"Aw, c'mon."<br>
<br>
Amane shot his friend a glare that dared him to keep going, but Itsuki did not look the<br>
<br>
least bit discouraged. On the other hand, he wasn't wearing his usual cheeky grin,<br>
<br>
either. Itsuki's expression looked genuinely happy—and even a little proud.<br>
<br>
"Well, fine, I'm not expecting you to admit it. But I want you to know that I'm happy<br>
<br>
for you, man. I'm happy that you found somebody who can appreciate you."<br>
<br>
"Huh?"<br>
<br>
"Geez, you really are dense. Look, most of the folks in our class probably think you're<br>
<br>
a weird, gloomy loner."<br>
<br>
"I'm perfectly aware of that, thank you very much."<br>
<br>
Among his classmates, Amane had always been something of a plain, unsociable<br>
<br>
character, the kind of boy who never really stood out or got noticed, despite his high<br>
<br>
ranking on almost every exam.<br>
<br>
Compared to guys like Itsuki, the sophisticated and cheerful gentleman, or Yuuta, the<br>
<br>
fresh-faced prince, Amane might as well have been invisible. Not to mention that,<br>
<br>
whether he knew it or not, Amane was always doing his hardest to not stand out or<br>
<br>
make waves. Of course he wasn't popular.<br>
<br>
"But they're only going by what they can see," Itsuki continued. "They don't know the<br>
<br>
real you. And even the people who do get to know you have to look hard to see your<br>
<br>
good parts."<br>
<br>
Itsuki was staring at Amane without a hint of mockery in his eyes. His sudden<br>
<br>
earnestness made Amane a little uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
"It's such a waste that you don't know just what an awesome guy you are. That's why<br>
<br>
I'm so happy that Shiina sees you for who you really are and gets along with you so<br>
<br>
well."<br>
<br>
"Itsuki…"<br>
<br>
"So hurry up and start dating her, and let's go on a double date!"<br>
<br>
"Geez, why does it always come back around to that?"<br>
<br>
While he obviously couldn't pass up the opportunity to tease his friend, Amane<br>
<br>
noticed that Itsuki wasn't looking directly at him. He was probably trying to hide his<br>
<br>
embarrassment after getting all emotional. Amane figured Itsuki could stand to be offbalance for a change.<br>
<br>
"Chi would be happy, too, ya know," Itsuki added.<br>
<br>
"By all means, you two go have the time of your lives. Just leave us out of it. I mean,<br>
<br>
if—and this is entirely hypothetical—but if we did develop that sort of relationship,<br>
<br>
would you really want to be seen with a guy who looks like I do?"<br>
<br>
"No, we'd obviously get you to transform into the mystery man. Speaking of which,<br>
<br>
you still haven't let me see it."<br>
<br>
"Nope."<br>
<br>
"Is it one of those things you only let Shiina see?"<br>
<br>
"Itsuki, you have a choice. Either you can shut up and enjoy my hospitality or freeze to<br>
<br>
death beneath the cold winter sky."<br>
<br>
"Well, excuuuse me!"<br>
<br>
Itsuki knelt on top of his futon and bowed in mock apology.<br>
<br>
"Good grief," Amane muttered in an exasperated tone.<br>
<br>
Itsuki must have still been scheming up ways to get his buddy a girlfriend to spice up<br>
<br>
his life.<br>
<br>
But there's no way I have any chance of dating Mahiru… right?<br>
<br>
She already did so much for him. If the two of them really did start dating, he would<br>
<br>
probably come to rely on her for absolutely everything. Forget how spoiled he was<br>
<br>
now, dating Mahiru was a sure path to utter dependency.<br>
<br>
And anyway, Mahiru didn't seem interested in guys.<br>
<br>
She didn't have much of a problem being around Amane or Itsuki or even Amane's<br>
<br>
father, but when it came to the other boys at school, she kept them all at a comfortable<br>
<br>
distance, wearing her angel mask like thick armor.<br>
<br>
Male classmates were constantly approaching her to confess their love, but he'd never<br>
<br>
known Mahiru to date anyone, ever. It was like she didn't want anything to do with<br>
<br>
boys.<br>
<br>
And since Amane still wasn't sure exactly how he felt about Mahiru, he was in no hurry<br>
<br>
to embarrass himself with a halfhearted confession. Plus, he was convinced that<br>
<br>
Mahiru didn't have those kinds of feelings for him anyway. 3<br>
<br>
Dating Mahiru would remain a distant fantasy.<br>
<br>
"…But look, Shiina obviously really likes you. Step back and take a good look at your<br>
<br>
situation before you dismiss it all as impossible." Itsuki spoke as if he had seen straight<br>
<br>
through Amane's heart.<br>
<br>
Amane just mumbled "…Easy for you to say…" and crawled under his comforter.<br>
<br>
"Itsuki is so sneaky! I want to eat Mahirun's cooking, tooooo!"<br>
<br>
The following day, Chitose called Amane on the phone at a ridiculously early hour.<br>
<br>
Evidently, Itsuki had been in touch with her the night before. He had taken photos of<br>
<br>
their dinner, like he had often seen many girls going, apparently for the purpose of<br>
<br>
sending it to Chitose.<br>
<br>
"Don't tell me. You've gotta ask Shiina."<br>
<br>
"Okay, so if I get Mahirun to say it's okay, you'll share with me?"<br>
<br>
"Uh, well—"<br>
<br>
"Got it!" Chitose answered energetically. "Okay, I'm gonna go ask her!"<br>
<br>
Then she hung up.<br>
<br>
Amane had been holding the phone away from his ear because Chitose was so loud.<br>
<br>
Now he made an exasperated face. As usual, he wasn't sure whether he should be<br>
<br>
impressed or terrified by Chitose's energy.<br>
<br>
Itsuki, who'd been watching the whole time, looked awfully pleased.<br>
<br>
"Chi sounds pretty excited."<br>
<br>
"Can't you do something about your girlfriend?"<br>
<br>
"Pretty much impossible, man," Itsuki replied cheerfully. "When she sees something<br>
<br>
she wants, Chi doesn't hold back. That's why I love her so much."<br>
<br>
Amane figured that Itsuki's opinion was a little biased, on account of being in love and<br>
<br>
all. There was a lot to be said for Chitose's abundant energy and the easy way she made<br>
<br>
friends with almost everyone, and Amane was ready to admit that he often envied<br>
<br>
those strengths that he so clearly lacked.<br>
<br>
For the time being, he decided to heat up the leftovers from yesterday's dinner and<br>
<br>
have them for breakfast. Silently, he thanked Mahiru for the food and for her future<br>
<br>
patience dealing with Chitose's call.<br>
<br>
"And so here I am!"<br>
<br>
Chitose appeared, along with Mahiru, just before lunch. The two of them were carrying<br>
<br>
shopping bags overflowing with food. Chitose was also wearing a backpack that looked<br>
<br>
like it might be an overnight bag, and Mahiru was smiling ruefully. They'd obviously<br>
<br>
met up earlier and gone shopping together. That explained why they were both<br>
<br>
carrying bags and how Chitose had reached Amane's apartment.<br>
<br>
"You got here pretty quick…," Amane remarked.<br>
<br>
"I got all excited about the idea of staying over at Mahirun's place!"<br>
<br>
"…Wait, what?"<br>
<br>
"We are on spring vacation, so I figured, why not? And Mahirun said I could, so here I<br>
<br>
am!"<br>
<br>
Chitose grinned widely and looked at Mahiru for confirmation, and Mahiru nodded<br>
<br>
with a smile.<br>
<br>
She obviously had no choice.<br>
<br>
Chitose must have strong-armed Mahiru into allowing her to stay over. But Mahiru<br>
<br>
didn't seem particularly upset or anything, only somewhat bewildered by the sudden<br>
<br>
development.<br>
<br>
As Mahiru went to put the groceries away in the refrigerator, she leaned close to<br>
<br>
Amane. "Don't worry about me. I told her it was okay," she reassured him in a whisper<br>
<br>
so quiet that only he could hear.<br>
<br>
Amane wore a worried smile as he watched Mahiru put the dinner ingredients in the<br>
<br>
fridge.<br>
<br>
"I'm looking forward to Mahirun's cooking!" Chitose beamed as she sat down next to<br>
<br>
Itsuki and clung tightly to his side. Amane had lost his seat for the moment, so he<br>
<br>
headed into the kitchen.<br>
<br>
"Is there anything I can do to help?"<br>
<br>
"…Amane, you know you can't cook."<br>
<br>
She kept her voice down so it didn't carry into the living room and called him by his<br>
<br>
first name. Amane smiled slightly.<br>
<br>
"I could cut up vegetables or something? Actually, if you give me instructions, I could<br>
<br>
do something simple. I showed you that I can actually make some things, didn't I?"<br>
<br>
"…All right, I'll take the help. You really don't want to stay in the other room, do you?"<br>
<br>
"Very perceptive. They're already flirting."<br>
<br>
Amane shrugged and moved to the sink to wash his hands.<br>
<br>
He knew he couldn't do much, but it wasn't like he was completely useless. He could<br>
<br>
at least help Mahiru out with things like measuring and prep work, so he turned his<br>
<br>
back on the lovebirds and their flirting for a while and became Mahiru's kitchen<br>
<br>
assistant.<br>
<br>
"By the way, what are we having for lunch today?"<br>
<br>
"Omelets over rice, with green potage soup and a salad. Chitose said that she wanted<br>
<br>
to eat the type of omelet that's half cooked inside when you cut it open with a knife."<br>
<br>
"Nice."<br>
<br>
"You really like egg dishes, don't you?"<br>
<br>
"Eggs are great. Plus, yours are the most delicious, so I'm already looking forward to<br>
<br>
it."<br>
<br>
Mahiru's cooking never disappointed, and Amane was even more excited to hear they<br>
<br>
were having eggs, his favorite. He still thought about the beef stew omelets they had<br>
<br>
eaten that one time. He would have been happy eating those every day.<br>
<br>
Amane silently lauded Chitose for her excellent menu request as he cheerfully<br>
<br>
measured and washed four portions of rice. Gradually, he noticed that Mahiru was still<br>
<br>
standing there, next to the refrigerator.<br>
<br>
"…What's up?"<br>
<br>
"…I appreciate the compliment, but don't catch me off guard like that."<br>
<br>
"What do you mean?"<br>
<br>
"It's fine if you didn't get it."<br>
<br>
Mahiru abruptly turned away and began cutting up the ingredients for the soup,<br>
<br>
leaving Amane standing there looking bewildered.<br>
<br>
"I can't believe they can act like that and still not be dating."<br>
<br>
"Seriously."<br>
<br>
"Ah, that was sooo goood!"<br>
<br>
Chitose finished the last of her lunch and patted her belly in utter satisfaction.<br>
<br>
Mahiru smiled, glad that her efforts were so appreciated. Apparently, she rather liked<br>
<br>
entertaining. The day's sudden appearances had evidently not been too trying.<br>
<br>
"Wow, you really can make anything, huh, Shiina?" Itsuki gushed. "You were able to<br>
<br>
prepare half-cooked omelets that kept their shape while still being so soft in the<br>
<br>
middle."<br>
<br>
"It's all thanks to my cooking teacher," Mahiru replied modestly.<br>
<br>
"You studied cooking?" Chitose asked.<br>
<br>
"Yes, sort of. Enough to take care of myself and to entertain guests when I need to."<br>
<br>
"Whoa!" Chitose marveled. "That must have been one amazing teacher if you learned<br>
<br>
to cook like this!"<br>
<br>
Mahiru must have been talking about the maid she had mentioned to Amane before,<br>
<br>
the only person in her parents' house who had treated her with any kindness.<br>
<br>
"I wonder if I could get this good, if I had a teacher like that."<br>
<br>
"Maybe if you were a little less… adventurous in the kitchen, you would have better<br>
<br>
results," Itsuki suggested.<br>
<br>
"Hey—what's the point if you don't experiment a little?!"<br>
<br>
"Well, if you tried following a recipe for once, I'm sure you could make just about<br>
<br>
anything."<br>
<br>
It was true; Chitose would have made a really good cook if she ever stopped messing<br>
<br>
around. But her lack of discipline really undermined her efforts.<br>
<br>
Chitose's personality was like a cat's—she did whatever she fancied at the moment and<br>
<br>
generally pursued things at her own speed. The problem was that she had basically<br>
<br>
no self-control. She could force herself to focus for a while if she had to, but it was<br>
<br>
obviously exhausting for her. Chitose just wasn't wired that way.<br>
<br>
"And not just in the kitchen, either," Itsuki continued. "You could try bringing a little<br>
<br>
composure to your everyday life. You've got a great role model right there, see?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, I'm sure you'd just love me to become more like Mahirun, but I'm afraid you're<br>
<br>
out of luck. Besides, it seems… uncomfortable."<br>
<br>
"That's awfully rude to Shiina."<br>
<br>
"Maybe. But you have to admit, Mahirun always seems so formal. Or maybe, like,<br>
<br>
stifled?" Sometimes Chitose could be surprisingly perceptive. "The Mahirun we see at<br>
<br>
school is pretty dull."<br>
<br>
"…Is that really how I come off to others?" Mahiru murmured.<br>
<br>
"Well… we are in different classes," Chitose answered, "so I'm no authority, but you<br>
<br>
seem dull or… sort of like you're looking down on everything, from a distance, you<br>
<br>
know? I mean, you're still nice to everyone, but I can tell you never let your guard<br>
<br>
down."<br>
<br>
Chitose's conjecture was right on target.<br>
<br>
Mahiru certainly treated others with kindness and respect, but she also never let<br>
<br>
anyone except for a very small number of people see behind her mask. By playing the<br>
<br>
part of the gracious and upstanding young woman, she kept her true identity safe and<br>
<br>
hidden.<br>
<br>
Nobody knew that better than Mahiru, though. Amane watched her expression grow<br>
<br>
cloudy. But Chitose threw an arm around her and smiled.<br>
<br>
"Mahirun makes a super-cute face whenever I bring up this kinda personal stuff, so<br>
<br>
you can tell that she's being honest, right? I like this version best!"<br>
<br>
Chitose giggled and squeezed Mahiru tight. Mahiru looked embarrassed for a moment,<br>
<br>
but then she hesitantly returned Chitose's embrace.<br>
<br>
"You know, Mahirun," Chitose continued, "I think you should open up more. I mean,<br>
<br>
you could have Amane totally spoil you, you know? And we know you can be super<br>
<br>
sweet to people you like. So if you'd just use that to your advantage, you'd have them<br>
<br>
eating out of your palm!"<br>
<br>
"I will do no such thing!" Mahiru insisted.<br>
<br>
"Ehhh?"<br>
<br>
"…I'm not like that at all, Chitose," Mahiru muttered, turning away sharply.<br>
<br>
"Oh reaaally?" Chitose replied, staring at Amane.<br>
<br>
Of course Amane was not about to get involved in this discussion. Mahiru hadn't asked<br>
<br>
him for help or anything, and he knew that she could fight her own battles.<br>
<br>
That said, if she ever did happen to ask, Amane was ready and willing to do just about<br>
<br>
anything her heart desired. He would help her shoulder any burden and support her<br>
<br>
however he could. That would be too embarrassing to admit, though, so he tried to 1<br>
<br>
maintain a neutral expression as he watched Chitose and Mahiru's exchange.<br>
<br>
"Oh man, it's a feast for the eyes to watch two beautiful girls getting along, huh?"<br>
<br>
"Your words, not mine."<br>
<br>
Letting Itsuki's somewhat perverted remark pass by without comment, Amane<br>
<br>
realized that Mahiru had found a friend of the same gender. He was glad she had<br>
<br>
someone else she could be open with.<br>
<br>
Chitose's sleepover naturally took place at Mahiru's place.<br>
<br>
Amane had expected her to want to stay with Itsuki, but she had said that since he was<br>
<br>
always staying over at her place, she was happy being with Mahiru, and the two of<br>
<br>
them headed back to Mahiru's apartment after dinner.<br>
<br>
Amane had already known that Itsuki and Chitose were very close, and that Itsuki<br>
<br>
often spent the night at Chitose's house. There wasn't anything strange about it, but<br>
<br>
for some reason, he suddenly felt embarrassed to be confronted with the fact that<br>
<br>
Itsuki often slept at Chitose's place.<br>
<br>
Itsuki whispered, "Whatcha imagining over there, gloomy boy?"<br>
<br>
Amane stomped on his friend's foot. He was merciful enough not to stomp on his<br>
<br>
pinkie toe.<br>
<br>
"Listen, man, stomping on my feet isn't gonna hide your shame forever!" Itsuki<br>
<br>
grumbled.<br>
<br>
"It's your fault for being such a jerk," Amane muttered as he turned away.<br>
<br>
It's not like he'd been trying to hurt him or anything—Itsuki obviously knew that.<br>
<br>
Neither of them were actually angry over a little playful roughhousing between friends.<br>
<br>
"Actually, I've been staying at her place a ton recently. It's started to become kind of<br>
<br>
the new normal, you know?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, yeah, I get the picture. You can lay off already."<br>
<br>
"I thought that kind of talk was standard between guys."<br>
<br>
"It's not, and I can do without it."<br>
<br>
Amane had no desire to hear the graphic details of his friend's romance, and he knew<br>
<br>
that when the story was over, and he glared at Itsuki, Itsuki would cackle with laughter<br>
<br>
and smile back at him cheerfully.<br>
<br>
"You really are a herbivore, eh, Amane? Or is it just a lack of experience that's holding<br>
<br>
you back?"<br>
<br>
"I'll knock you on your ass."<br>
<br>
"Well, I guess that's exactly why Shiina opened up to you in the first place, huh? She<br>
<br>
probably wouldn't have gone anywhere near you if she knew you were on the prowl.<br>
<br>
Good thing, too, huh?!"<br>
<br>
Itsuki gave him a thumbs-up and a big grin. Amane shot him a bitter glare, the sort of<br>
<br>
face he would never have shown Mahiru.<br>
<br>
But it didn't seem to have the slightest effect on Itsuki, who merely laughed it off.<br>
<br>
Amane was busy furiously scowling at his friend when his anger was interrupted by a<br>
<br>
cheerful electronic tone from his smartphone—his text message alert. He stopped<br>
<br>
glowering long enough to check the screen. The message was from Chitose.<br>
<br>
Amane opened the messaging app, thinking that she must be asking about tomorrow's<br>
<br>
plans, and saw that he had one message, and that it included a photograph.<br>
<br>
"Look, look, Mahirun is sooo cute! FYI, I got her permission to send this."<br>
<br>
There was just that one sentence and an attached photo. 2<br>
<br>
The picture showed Mahiru sitting on top of a bed, holding the teddy bear that Amane<br>
<br>
had given her propped up on her knees, with what looked like her bedroom in the<br>
<br>
background. That was not what made Amane pause.<br>
<br>
In the photo, Mahiru was wearing pajamas—specifically,
<p></p>
a flowing, long-sleeved, light-pink gown, otherwise known as a negligee.
<p></p>
She looked elegant and refined—and  hypnotically feminine.
<p></p>
he had obviously just stepped out of the bath, and the skin<br>
<br>
peeking from her sleeves and the open collar of her gown was still faintly flushed.<br>
<br>
It was an incredibly suggestive image, even though nothing inappropriate was exposed.<br>
<br>
She somehow looked modest and seductive at the same time.<br>
<br>
And what drew his eyes more than anything else was Mahiru's expression. She wasn't<br>
<br>
looking at the camera. Rather, her head hung slightly, and she kept her eyes downcast—<br>
<br>
not enough to hide her face, but enough to give the impression of shyness.<br>
<br>
The rosy spots on her cheeks were probably not just from the bath.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's expression looked shy, but like she was yearning. It was way more enticing<br>
<br>
than any expression he had ever seen before. But the teddy bear sitting in her lap also<br>
<br>
made her look even more adorable than usual. It was just a photograph, but Amane<br>
<br>
could feel his cheeks burning.<br>
<br>
—That jerk!<br>
<br>
What was Chitose trying to do, sending him a photo like this? Especially right before<br>
<br>
bed? There was no way he was going to be able to sleep after seeing something like<br>
<br>
that.<br>
<br>
"Why are you blushing?" Itsuki inquired. "You looking at dirty pictures on your phone<br>
<br>
or something?"<br>
<br>
"Of course not!"<br>
<br>
"Okay, then what are you looking at?"<br>
<br>
Itsuki quickly peeked over his shoulder, and Amane had no time to hide the image. The<br>
<br>
picture displayed on the screen was reflected in Itsuki's eyes, and he smiled knowingly.<br>
<br>
"I see, I see. You really are one innocent boy, huh?"<br>
<br>
"How about you go to sleep—forever?"<br>
<br>
"Are you implying that you want me dead?"<br>
<br>
"Should I say it directly?"<br>
<br>
"That's awfully unkind of you. I mean, what man wouldn't get excited seeing an angel<br>
<br>
like that? Though, I gotta say, Chi's still the cutest…"<br>
<br>
"Stop going on about your girlfriend already, stupid."<br>
<br>
Amane sighed in exasperation and brushed his hair back with his hand, and when he<br>
<br>
did, he heard the clicking sound of a camera shutter.<br>
<br>
"…Itsuki?"<br>
<br>
"Nothing; just got a message from Chi telling me to take a picture of you to<br>
<br>
commemorate the evening. Just a dumb little memento. Should be no problem, right?"<br>
<br>
"I guess. As long as you're not planning to do anything with my photo…"<br>
<br>
"Relax, it's not like anyone else will ever see it. And besides, there's a good reason for<br>
<br>
it, I can assure you."<br>
<br>
Amane regarded Itsuki with deep skepticism. He had no idea what that reason could<br>
<br>
be. But Itsuki just smiled, looking particularly smug, and Amane let out a big sigh,<br>
<br>
grumbling quietly to himself that there was no point in taking his photo.<br>
<br>
Listening to his friend complain, Itsuki muttered in an even quieter voice, "This guy<br>
<br>
really doesn't get it, does he?"<br>
<br>
"…I'm exhausted…"<br>
<br>
On the third day, Itsuki and Chitose's stay was finally over. The two of them had gone<br>
<br>
back to Chitose's place, where Itsuki would spend another day or two. (Apparently<br>
<br>
Chitose's parents would've been perfectly fine if he stayed forever, but all the same, he<br>
<br>
didn't want to impose.) They'd eaten Mahiru's homemade lunch and left with big<br>
<br>
smiles, but not before encouraging Amane and Mahiru to play nice in their absence.<br>
<br>
Amane had figured that quipping back would have been more trouble than it was<br>
<br>
worth, so he'd let their teasing slide.<br>
<br>
"Aren't you tired, too, Mahiru?"<br>
<br>
The two of them were sitting together on Amane's couch.<br>
<br>
"…I'm wiped out. That was really hard. But it was also a lot of fun."<br>
<br>
"Yeah?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru wasn't the type to invite friends over to her apartment, at least for as long as<br>
<br>
Amane had known her, so he thought it was great that Chitose had given her the excuse<br>
<br>
to do just that.<br>
<br>
It sounded like she sometimes hung out with Chitose when Amane wasn't around, so<br>
<br>
if she had made a close friend, that couldn't be a bad thing.<br>
<br>
"…Well, you know, I was really surprised when that photo was sent…"<br>
<br>
"Ah, ah, oh that?"<br>
<br>
When Mahiru said the word photo, Amane couldn't help but recall her elegant yet<br>
<br>
risque getup from the night before. His cheeks were burning.<br>
<br>
It wasn't like she had bared a lot of skin, but Amane could still remember the way her<br>
<br>
nightgown had accentuated her soft curves. If anything, her modesty had only made<br>
<br>
her more enticing. He'd already filed the image away in his mind for later, though he<br>
<br>
felt surprisingly guilty about it.<br>
<br>
"Y-yesterday," Mahiru explained, "yesterday, Chitose said 'You're so cute!' and took a<br>
<br>
lot of photos. S-so, I'm not exactly sure which one she sent you. She was really insistent,<br>
<br>
so I gave her my permission, but… I hope it wasn't anything too embarrassing…"<br>
<br>
Apparently, Chitose hadn't shown Mahiru which photo she had sent. Amane figured<br>
<br>
she'd sent him the best shot, but he wondered whether Mahiru was aware how she'd<br>
<br>
looked—or even that Chitose had photographed that particular moment at all. He<br>
<br>
wasn't sure how Mahiru would react if he showed her the picture. The photo wasn't<br>
<br>
obscene or anything, and Mahiru definitely hadn't looked bad, but still, it could cause<br>
<br>
a lot of trouble.<br>
<br>
"Uh, ummm, well, it was… it was a picture of you with the teddy bear on your knees."<br>
<br>
"…Th-the teddy bear…?"<br>
<br>
"I guess you're taking good care of it, huh?"<br>
<br>
Well, that part was true, at least.<br>
<br>
Amane, still feeling guilty, decided the best thing to do was shove the image deep down<br>
<br>
into the recesses of his memory. If he couldn't forget it, he could at least seal it away.<br>
<br>
When Mahiru heard the word bear, she seemed to more or less recall the moment the<br>
<br>
photo had been taken, and she smiled slightly.<br>
<br>
"…I told you I was going to cherish it," she said, "because it's a precious gift."<br>
<br>
Confronted with her warm gaze and soft, welcoming smile, Amane's breath caught in<br>
<br>
his throat.<br>
<br>
This smile was different from her usual angelic smile—it was honest and affectionate.<br>
<br>
Amane felt hypnotized by her delicate beauty, like her soft sweetness was beckoning<br>
<br>
him to wrap his arms around her and pull her close.<br>
<br>
"…Uh, y-yeah, I guess you did," Amane stammered. "You must really like it, huh?"<br>
<br>
"Of course I do," Mahiru replied. "You picked it out for me, after all." She smiled<br>
<br>
earnestly. "You don't have to worry; I treat him well. Why, every day I pat him on the<br>
<br>
head, and I hold him tight when I fall asleep, and—ummm… never mind. Forget I said<br>
<br>
anything."<br>
<br>
Amane could hardly believe he'd heard her right.<br>
<br>
A beautiful girl like Mahiru sleeps with a stuffed teddy bear. That's unspeakably cute.<br>
<br>
He recalled how angelic Mahiru looked when she was asleep. Just imagining the scene<br>
<br>
made him blush.<br>
<br>
Wearing that angelic sleeping face, she cuddles a stuffed bear while she slumbers.<br>
<br>
Mahiru, this beautiful girl, goes to bed holding the teddy bear I gave her.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had already turned bright red, all the way out to her ears. She grabbed him by<br>
<br>
the arm. "P-please forget about that last part."<br>
<br>
"Th-that's literally impossible."<br>
<br>
"Ugh, I'm so embarrassed!"<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked at him with tears forming in the corners of her eyes. This expression<br>
<br>
was even more devastatingly cute than the last, but it was obvious that Mahiru didn't<br>
<br>
realize it.<br>
<br>
"Is it really that big a deal? I don't see what the problem is."<br>
<br>
"It makes me seem like a little kid, doesn't it? Sleeping with a stuffed animal, I mean."<br>
<br>
"N-no, I think it's really cute."<br>
<br>
Mahiru turned away from Amane and buried her face in her favorite cushion. "You're<br>
<br>
not helping…"<br>
<br>
Amane felt awfully guilty for thinking that Mahiru looked cute when she was pouting,<br>
<br>
but he couldn't help himself—he found it endearing.<br>
<br>
What he wanted to do right then was reach out and stroke Mahiru's head, but he knew<br>
<br>
that was a terrible idea, especially now, so he kept his hands to himself and only looked<br>
<br>
over at Mahiru.<br>
<br>
After a few moments had passed, she peeked out from behind the cushion. Her eyes<br>
<br>
shimmered, and her face was flushed, but she composed herself enough to give him a<br>
<br>
reproachful look.<br>
<br>
"…Amane, you need to tell me something embarrassing, too. It's not fair if I'm the only<br>
<br>
one."<br>
<br>
"What…?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru had done this to herself. Amane felt no responsibility to put himself in a similar<br>
<br>
position. But he knew better than to say that.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, he was having a hard time coming up with anything embarrassing<br>
<br>
that she didn't already know.<br>
<br>
"If you won't tell me something," Mahiru said sternly, "I'll just have to message<br>
<br>
Akazawa and ask him."<br>
<br>
"When did you exchange contact info with Itsuki…?"<br>
<br>
"Actually, Chitose gave me his information, and we messaged back and forth…<br>
<br>
yesterday, I think. But it wasn't about anything in particular… nothing you need to<br>
<br>
worry about anyway…"<br>
<br>
Mahiru trailed off and buried her face in the cushion again.<br>
<br>
At this point, Amane really had no idea what was going on.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 24: An Incident and the Angel’s Truth<br>
<br>
Spring vacation meant quite a lot of free time for those without any particularly<br>
<br>
involved hobbies. It wasn't that Amane had no interests, he just preferred activities<br>
<br>
like reading and taking long walks. On occasion, his classmates made fun of him for<br>
<br>
being so dull.<br>
<br>
But Amane wasn't interested in sports or outdoor games. Unless he had somewhere<br>
<br>
to be, his trips outside were for running or walking, or to go buy groceries, and that<br>
<br>
was about it. Itsuki had always wondered why Amane didn't appreciate his youth<br>
<br>
more, but Amane figured he got enough exercise to stay healthy.<br>
<br>
Mahiru also didn't seem to go out much. Of course, he sometimes saw her exercising,<br>
<br>
and she often ventured outside to buy things she needed, but she didn't really go out<br>
<br>
specifically to do anything recreational.<br>
<br>
"Don't you want to go somewhere for fun?"<br>
<br>
When he asked Mahiru about it one day after dinner, she looked troubled for a moment,<br>
<br>
then smiled and answered, "Go somewhere for fun…? Not right now, no. I'm kind of a<br>
<br>
homebody."<br>
<br>
Amane wasn't one to talk, but he wondered whether it was healthy for a beautiful high<br>
<br>
school girl to stay in all the time. "Well, I guess I'm the same way, huh? I don't really<br>
<br>
feel like going out anywhere, either."<br>
<br>
"…What about going back to your parents' house?" Mahiru asked.<br>
<br>
"I saw them at New Year's, so I think I can take a pass. Plus, I'm supposed to be going<br>
<br>
home this summer, too. And it would suck to miss out on your fantastic cooking."<br>
<br>
"…I-is that so?"<br>
<br>
Amane had definitely grown accustomed to enjoying Mahiru's cooking every day.<br>
<br>
Spending so much time together seemed normal now. He appreciated Mahiru's<br>
<br>
kindness and her beauty, and he felt calmer just being around her.<br>
<br>
"Not to mention, if I go home, they'll just drag me around all over the place, and that<br>
<br>
sounds exhausting."<br>
<br>
"…Drag you around?"<br>
<br>
"To resorts and shopping and stuff. If I don't have anything else to do, they take me<br>
<br>
wherever they want to go. Once when I was in middle school, we even went to hot<br>
<br>
spring resorts and stuff."<br>
<br>
Amane's mother didn't really care whether they were spending time indoors or<br>
<br>
outdoors—she could get excited about nearly anything as long as she was spending<br>
<br>
time with family. Whenever Amane didn't have plans, she often tried to drag him with<br>
<br>
her somewhere. She was usually kind enough to let him choose where they went, but<br>
<br>
if he let her get away with it, she wouldn't hesitate to take advantage of him.<br>
<br>
Amusement parks and shopping malls were charming enough, but Amane's mother<br>
<br>
also enjoyed mountaineering and airsoft games, which were more intense. Amane had<br>
<br>
never understood how she contained so much energy in her petite frame.<br>
<br>
Thanks to his mother, Amane had learned how to do all sorts of things, and even stayed<br>
<br>
in decent shape, but it was obvious that his own preference for quiet hobbies was<br>
<br>
something of a reaction to his mother's riotous enthusiasm.<br>
<br>
"…That sounds fun," Mahiru said.<br>
<br>
"When it's every single day, you get tired of it pretty quick. I'd rather not start off a<br>
<br>
new school year totally ragged after trying to keep up with her."<br>
<br>
"Ha-ha, I can imagine."<br>
<br>
"You'd understand if you came with me. Then she'd focus all her energy on you<br>
<br>
instead."<br>
<br>
"I s-suppose so…"<br>
<br>
Amane was sure that his mother would be delighted to go out somewhere with<br>
<br>
Mahiru. He didn't think she'd want to do anything too hardcore, but she would<br>
<br>
definitely take her around shopping and stuff.<br>
<br>
He knew that his mother had always wanted a daughter and would probably leap at<br>
<br>
the chance to spend time with any girl right around this age, much less a girl like<br>
<br>
Mahiru.<br>
<br>
"You'll see, if you come to visit over the summer. She'll probably drag you all over the<br>
<br>
place and treat you like a dress-up doll again."<br>
<br>
"…Summer?"<br>
<br>
"I have a feeling she's going to ask me to bring you home with me."<br>
<br>
By which I mean she's actually already tried to pressure me into it.<br>
<br>
As things stood, Shihoko was probably going to approach Mahiru directly by the time<br>
<br>
summer vacation rolled around.<br>
<br>
"Ah, well, if you hate the idea, feel free to decline."<br>
<br>
"N-no, I don't hate it! If anything, I'm happy!"<br>
<br>
Mahiru shook her head forcefully, and as her hair cascaded around her face, the scent<br>
<br>
of her shampoo tickled Amane's nose.<br>
<br>
"Mm. All right, I'll go ahead and tell Mom. I know she'll be happy to have you over."<br>
<br>
"…Thank you."<br>
<br>
"I should be the one thanking you for taking some of the burden."<br>
<br>
"Oh, please." She slapped his upper arm gently.<br>
<br>
Of course it didn't hurt, but Amane's heart started pounding the moment she touched<br>
<br>
him.<br>
<br>
"…Amane?"<br>
<br>
"A-ah, nothing, it's nothing."<br>
<br>
"You don't really look like it's nothing, but…"<br>
<br>
"Honestly, don't worry about it. Oh, look at that. You got a message or something."<br>
<br>
Amane was all too happy to change the subject. He pointed to Mahiru's phone. It was<br>
<br>
vibrating and flashing a notification.<br>
<br>
Thankfully, Mahiru shifted her attention to the phone. "What could this be?" she<br>
<br>
muttered as she picked it up and opened the messaging application.<br>
<br>
Of course Amane knew it would be rude to read over her shoulder, and he didn't<br>
<br>
especially want to make eye contact with Mahiru at that exact moment, so he found<br>
<br>
somewhere else to look, but… when he heard a soft thump, he looked back over to<br>
<br>
Mahiru and froze.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had dropped her phone onto the cushion on her knees and wore an expression<br>
<br>
like a lost child, as if she was about to cry.<br>
<br>
It wasn't just the tears collecting in her eyes or the odd twist in her mouth… She looked<br>
<br>
like she might shatter if he so much as touched her.<br>
<br>
Where have I seen this expression before?<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, it reminds me of the first time we spoke.<br>
<br>
"…Mahiru?"<br>
<br>
"No, it's nothing. Please don't worry about it." Before Amane could even ask her what<br>
<br>
was the matter, she answered in a rigid voice. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to be<br>
<br>
getting home. I have some business to take care of tomorrow, so it seems I can't stay<br>
<br>
for dinner. I'm sorry."<br>
<br>
Mahiru did not give him the chance to argue. She quickly collected her things and left.<br>
<br>
Amane moved to stop her, but she either didn't notice or deliberately ignored him. He<br>
<br>
was left reaching out to empty air.<br>
<br>
…Why, so suddenly?<br>
<br>
He was certain that it must have had something to do with the message she'd received.<br>
<br>
As far as Amane knew, there was only one thing that could make her look that way.<br>
<br>
"…Mahiru's… parents."<br>
<br>
Mahiru didn't give her contact information to very many people, so only a very limited<br>
<br>
number of people knew her message app ID. There was Amane and his mother,<br>
<br>
Chitose and Itsuki, and he had heard that a few of the girls in her class who could keep<br>
<br>
a secret knew it as well. Aside from those people, he deduced that the only other<br>
<br>
people who might know it were her parents.<br>
<br>
He had to assume that the message had come from them.<br>
<br>
And suddenly saying that she had business to take care of tomorrow, when she hadn't<br>
<br>
mentioned anything the day before, must mean that Mahiru was probably going to<br>
<br>
meet them. He knew she had a difficult relationship with her parents, which explained<br>
<br>
the gloomy expression he saw just moments ago.<br>
<br>
Well, he might have determined the source of Mahiru's consternation, but there wasn't<br>
<br>
much he could do with that information.<br>
<br>
"…Mahiru."<br>
<br>
He had caught a glimpse of her face, crumpled and twisted, as she left. He hadn't said<br>
<br>
anything. Feeling helpless, he quietly muttered her name, letting his fist fall to the<br>
<br>
cushion that, until just a moment ago, she'd been holding.<br>
<br>
The weather was bad that day.<br>
<br>
Dark, heavy clouds blanketed the sky, and when Amane looked out the window, he<br>
<br>
couldn't see a single ray of sunlight. If anything was going to come down from that sky,<br>
<br>
it would be raindrops.<br>
<br>
Perhaps that was the reason it was so chilly, despite the end of March quickly coming<br>
<br>
up.<br>
<br>
Amane turned on the heater and had a seat on the couch, but somehow he couldn't<br>
<br>
compose himself. Without meaning to, his gaze kept drifting in the direction of<br>
<br>
Mahiru's apartment.<br>
<br>
Today must be the day that she's going to see her parents, huh?<br>
<br>
She had already informed him that she wasn't going to make dinner tonight, probably<br>
<br>
because she didn't want anyone to see her so emotional.<br>
<br>
Just remembering what Mahiru looked like wearing such a hurt expression placed a<br>
<br>
somber, disagreeable feeling in Amane's chest, like the dregs of something dark had<br>
<br>
collected there.<br>
<br>
He was so worried that he nearly sent her a text asking if she needed anything before<br>
<br>
deciding against it. He was incredibly agitated, but looking around his room, he<br>
<br>
realized there was nothing he could do, so for the moment, he decided to head to the<br>
<br>
supermarket to secure dinner.<br>
<br>
Even when he was out shopping, no matter what he did, Amane couldn't get the image<br>
<br>
of Mahiru's sad expression out of his mind. He imagined how painful it must be for her<br>
<br>
to have to meet her parents, if that was the kind of face she made.<br>
<br>
She had looked like she was afraid, he thought, pressing his lips together. Amane tried<br>
<br>
not to scowl, so that he wouldn't look like some crazy guy, but no matter what he tried,<br>
<br>
he just couldn't cheer himself up.<br>
<br>
Then he dropped a premade entre e into his shopping basket a little too roughly,<br>
<br>
making it all slosh around, and felt even worse.<br>
<br>
Sighing deeply the whole while, Amane paid for his things and slowly walked home<br>
<br>
under the cloudy sky—and then, when he took the elevator to his floor, he got a strange<br>
<br>
feeling. Just as he was about to step out into the hallway, Amane paused, lingering in<br>
<br>
the shadows of the elevator.<br>
<br>
There were two people standing in front of the door to Mahiru's apartment.<br>
<br>
One of them was a girl with familiar flaxen hair—it was Mahiru.<br>
<br>
And the other was a woman he had never seen before.<br>
<br>
Even at that distance, he could tell that she was quite beautiful. And she was tall as<br>
<br>
well, especially compared to the petite Mahiru—by Amane's estimate, she seemed<br>
<br>
taller than the average man. But her body was undeniably feminine. He could see her<br>
<br>
ample curves even under her fitted pantsuit and noted that she had an almost perfect<br>
<br>
figure.<br>
<br>
Her medium-length light-brown hair hung loosely down to her shoulders, and she<br>
<br>
carried herself with unmistakable poise. Her eyes were framed precisely with eyeliner,<br>
<br>
but Amane didn't think she needed any makeup to look bold and assertive. Even<br>
<br>
standing facing Mahiru, her stern gaze showed no sign of softening.<br>
<br>
She was quite a beauty, but her entire persona was incredibly intimidating. She looked<br>
<br>
like an extremely capable woman who was impossible to approach under normal<br>
<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
Comparing her to the neat and tidy lily that was Mahiru, this woman was like a striking<br>
<br>
rose. That's how different the two of them were in appearance and temperament.<br>
<br>
"Really, you're such a wretched little girl! And you look just like him. There's nothing I<br>
<br>
hate more."<br>
<br>
Amane stared in disbelief as vicious words slithered past the woman's crimson-painted lips.
<p></p>
He was sure that this person was Mahiru's mother, but when she spoke<br>
<br>
to Mahiru, it was with a voice full of scorn. He could hardly believe that Mahiru<br>
<br>
endured such cruelty at the hands of her own parent.<br>
<br>
"At least if you resembled me more it would be a little better… but you had to look like<br>
<br>
him. Well, it is what it is. Once you graduate, I won't have to deal with you anymore, so<br>
<br>
there's no point worrying about it now. We can send the necessary paperwork through<br>
<br>
the mail like always."<br>
<br>
"…Yes," Mahiru replied feebly.<br>
<br>
The woman snorted and turned on her heel. "This is good-bye, then. And don't bother<br>
<br>
me with pointless nonsense anymore."<br>
<br>
She was heading for the elevator, so Amane didn't have much choice but to step out<br>
<br>
into the hall. The woman glanced at him briefly as they passed each other but left<br>
<br>
without saying another word.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was still standing there, and when she recognized Amane, her face distorted<br>
<br>
into a grimace.<br>
<br>
"…Did you overhear?"<br>
<br>
"Sorry."<br>
<br>
He didn't lie. He apologized frankly.<br>
<br>
Though he hadn't intended to eavesdrop, he hadn't dared come out of hiding while<br>
<br>
they were talking. Plus, he hadn't wanted to abandon Mahiru in her current state.<br>
<br>
"So that woman was—"<br>
<br>
"…Sayo Shiina. My birth mother."<br>
<br>
Recently, Mahiru had been acting a lot more affectionate, but right now she was far<br>
<br>
stiffer than when they had first met, and when she spoke, her voice was stilted and<br>
<br>
ragged.<br>
<br>
"I'll just go ahead and say this," Mahiru continued before Amane could ask. "She's<br>
<br>
always been like that, so I'm used to it." Her voice was distant and monotonous. "My<br>
<br>
mother has hated me for as long as I can remember, and it's too late for that to change,<br>
<br>
so please don't worry about it."<br>
<br>
Stress, pain, heartbreak—Mahiru could not hide what she was feeling. Even Amane<br>
<br>
could see through her brave facade. He didn't stop to think about it—quietly, he took<br>
<br>
Mahiru's hand as she turned toward her apartment.<br>
<br>
He fully believed that his instincts were right this time.<br>
<br>
Because if he left her alone like this, it seemed likely that Mahiru's thoughts would<br>
<br>
head in a bad direction.<br>
<br>
She looked at him blankly, then gave him a feeble smile and tried to shake off his hand.<br>
<br>
But Amane gripped more tightly, determined not to let go. He didn't squeeze too hard<br>
<br>
but held her slender wrist firmly.<br>
<br>
"We're sticking together," Amane declared in the kind of authoritative tone he would<br>
<br>
normally never direct at Mahiru.<br>
<br>
Her face twisted into an awkward smile.<br>
<br>
"…Really, it's fine. You don't need to worry."<br>
<br>
"Well, I want to be with you." 1<br>
<br>
He knew he was being awfully presumptuous, but he didn't intend to back down now.<br>
<br>
He stared at Mahiru, and eventually she flashed him an exhausted smile and stopped<br>
<br>
trying to pull away.<br>
<br>
That was good enough for Amane. He led Mahiru into his apartment and sat her down<br>
<br>
on the sofa.<br>
<br>
Smiling weakly, Mahiru looked like she would blow apart after one stiff breeze. Still<br>
<br>
gripping her hand, Amane took a seat next to her, then let go of her wrist and placed<br>
<br>
her palms in his.<br>
<br>
Slowly, Mahiru seemed to relax a bit.<br>
<br>
"…It's not the best story, but here goes."<br>
<br>
After almost ten minutes had passed, Mahiru finally broke the silence.<br>
<br>
"My parents didn't marry for love," she said quietly. "They keep the exact circumstances<br>
<br>
a secret, but they only got married as part of a deal between the two families."<br>
<br>
That kind of marriage, based on family interests rather than love and trust, was rarely<br>
<br>
seen in modern Japan. It wasn't unheard of, but to Amane, it sounded like something<br>
<br>
out of an old storybook. He knew that Mahiru came from an upper-class family, but…<br>
<br>
even so, he almost found it difficult to believe.<br>
<br>
"And so… the truth is, they never really wanted a child. I was simply the result of one<br>
<br>
night's indiscretion. Unfortunately, after I was born, they had no choice but to support 2<br>
<br>
me financially… but that's all. I don't think they ever had any intention of raising me."<br>
<br>
"What do you mean by that?"<br>
<br>
"…They rarely ever came home. Even when they did, they just used the house as a place 1<br>
<br>
to stay briefly. When I was younger, I hardly ever saw their faces."<br>
<br>
Mahiru's voice was quiet and taut. She looked utterly exhausted.<br>
<br>
"I can't remember them ever doing anything parental. I was actually raised by our<br>
<br>
housekeeper. Mother had many affairs and usually stayed with her lovers, and Father 1<br>
<br>
was too devoted to his work to have any time for me. He probably had his own affairs<br>
<br>
as well… Anyway, they gave me plenty of money and left me alone. They said they<br>
<br>
didn't need a child in their lives. No matter how hard I tried, no matter what I did, they<br>
<br>
never once looked my way."<br>
<br>
Amane finally understood why Mahiru acted like an angel.<br>
<br>
She had spent her entire life trying to convince her parents she was worthy of their<br>
<br>
attention, even if only for a moment, by performing the role of the perfect child, and<br>
<br>
now she didn't know how to stop being perfect. That or she felt like she had no choice<br>
<br>
but to hide her feelings behind her angelic mask. Either way, Amane realized that the<br>
<br>
angel persona had never been something Mahiru took up by choice.<br>
<br>
"Ultimately, they never cared. Even though I grew up pretty, even though I got good<br>
<br>
grades, even though I was good at sports, even though I could do housework… those<br>
<br>
people never once looked my way. What a fool I was, trying so hard with nothing to<br>
<br>
show for it."<br>
<br>
Amane felt his chest tighten as he listened to her despair.<br>
<br>
"And because of my inconvenient existence, they can't even get a divorce. Neither one<br>
<br>
of them wants to be the one to leave. It would cause trouble both in their family life<br>
<br>
and at work. They wouldn't be able to expect any support from my grandparents. So<br>
<br>
they're waiting until I finish university. Once I'm independent, we won't see one<br>
<br>
another anymore."<br>
<br>
"That's…"<br>
<br>
"When my mother told me to my face that she didn't want me… it was a shock. I felt so<br>
<br>
lost. I sat out in the rain in a daze."<br>
<br>
That was why Mahiru had been in the park all those months ago, Amane realized. She<br>
<br>
had been wandering around in pain because of her mother's cruelty. She must have<br>
<br>
felt like she didn't belong anywhere—that was why she had looked so anxious and<br>
<br>
hopeless, like a lost child with no one to turn to for help. Not knowing what to do, she<br>
<br>
had lingered there in the park, alone with her mother's hateful words.<br>
<br>
As Amane imagined the scene, he felt the slight taste of iron spread through his mouth.<br>
<br>
It occurred to him that he had been biting his lip when he recognized the taste of<br>
<br>
blood. He was having trouble containing his outrage at this tragedy.<br>
<br>
"…If I was going to be that much trouble, she could have just not had me."<br>
<br>
Her tiny whisper struck him like a stake driven through his chest, pinning him in place.<br>
<br>
He was so angry at her parents that he could hardly think. Because of their neglect,<br>
<br>
Mahiru had grown up hiding her feelings, acting like she was strong while she silently<br>
<br>
agonized behind her mask of angelic perfection. Amane wanted to shout at them, to<br>
<br>
demand to know how they could treat her this way. But the people who had<br>
<br>
abandoned Mahiru were not around.<br>
<br>
And besides, Amane wasn't sure what he should actually do in this situation.<br>
<br>
He was certainly furious at her awful parents, but he was also an outsider, and he<br>
<br>
didn't think Mahiru would appreciate him poking his nose into her family business.<br>
<br>
He might just end up making everything worse. When he considered that he might<br>
<br>
only hurt Mahiru with his reckless words, he decided to hold his tongue.<br>
<br>
But it seemed like Mahiru would dissolve into thin air if he left her like this—so Amane<br>
<br>
took the blanket that was on the couch next to him and wrapped it around Mahiru's<br>
<br>
shoulders. She looked surprised, but he pulled the blanket over her head and folded<br>
<br>
her into his arms.<br>
<br>
This was the first time the two of them had really embraced, and her body felt tentative<br>
<br>
and fragile. He was almost afraid that she'd shatter if he squeezed just a little too hard.<br>
<br>
But it occurred to Amane that the person in his arms had learned that she was<br>
<br>
supposed to live without relying on anyone.<br>
<br>
"Wha—? A-Amane…?"<br>
<br>
"…I finally feel like I understand why you are the way you are."<br>
<br>
"You mean why I'm so pathetic?"<br>
<br>
"No… I mean how you'll try to endure any hardship—and why you never let your<br>
<br>
guard down."<br>
<br>
Mahiru had never been able to rely on anyone, but she had refused to let that break<br>
<br>
her. The maid had provided what help she could, but she was only an employee, not<br>
<br>
family. Mahiru had learned to persevere in life on her own, and she had obviously<br>
<br>
gotten quite good at it.<br>
<br>
"Look… I'm not going to interfere with your family situation," Amane said. "I know<br>
<br>
better than to stick my nose into other people's business."<br>
<br>
Amane was an outsider. There knew it was best to respect the depths when it came to<br>
<br>
complicated family relationships. However, that was not the same as saying that he<br>
<br>
wasn't going to support Mahiru.<br>
<br>
"…But if you need to cry or anything, go right ahead. I'll even pretend like I can't see<br>
<br>
you. It must be suffocating to have to suffer through such awful stuff."<br>
<br>
He didn't actually want to make her cry, but if she kept bottling it up like this, at some<br>
<br>
point, she would crack.<br>
<br>
So he wanted her to let out all her frustrations, everything she was holding back, and<br>
<br>
cry if she needed. And he would be there by her side if she needed him, too.<br>
<br>
He couldn't do much other than support her.<br>
<br>
Amane wondered if he wasn't being too presumptuous, but as Mahiru wriggled in his<br>
<br>
arms and buried her face in Amane's chest, all that apprehension disappeared.<br>
<br>
"…Will you keep it a secret?" she asked in a small voice.<br>
<br>
"I can't see you, so I know nothing."<br>
<br>
"…All right then, just for a little bit… let me lean on you," she mumbled. It was the first<br>
<br>
time she had ever asked him for support.<br>
<br>
Amane didn't respond—he felt like he might be the one to cry if he tried. Instead, he<br>
<br>
just pulled the blanket farther up over Mahiru's shoulders and held her tight.<br>
<br>
"…Promise you didn't look?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru hadn't cried for long, maybe ten minutes, tops.<br>
<br>
It would have been great if she could have cried enough to get out sixteen years' worth<br>
<br>
of anguish, but that seemed like more than her body could handle right now. If she<br>
<br>
added physical fatigue to her mental stress, her brain would probably just shut down.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's cheeks were wet when she lifted her face, but she seemed to have recovered<br>
<br>
a little of her spirit, because when her eyes met Amane's, her gaze did not waver.<br>
<br>
"Well, you were leaning up against me, so I couldn't really see much. I definitely didn't<br>
<br>
see you crying or anything."<br>
<br>
Mahiru had slipped off the blanket and smiled gently.<br>
<br>
"…Amane?"<br>
<br>
"What is it?"<br>
<br>
"…Thank you."<br>
<br>
"I don't know what you're talking about," Amane replied, looking in the other<br>
<br>
direction. He didn't feel like he'd done anything worth thanking him for.<br>
<br>
Mahiru buried her face in his chest again.<br>
<br>
"Let me stay here a little bit longer, please."<br>
<br>
"…Sure."<br>
<br>
It wasn't like he could push Mahiru aside when she was in this state even if he wanted<br>
<br>
to. Besides, he wanted to support her however he could. Calmly, he put his arm around<br>
<br>
her again and gently stroked her hair.<br>
<br>
If nobody else will tell her how wonderful she is, I'll do it myself, Amane thought. He<br>
<br>
wanted her to feel like she didn't have to try so hard anymore. Like she could relax,<br>
<br>
now that she was with him.<br>
<br>
Mahiru must have calmed down somewhat. When she looked up at Amane, she didn't<br>
<br>
seem so upset. But she didn't look especially cheerful, either. She probably still had a<br>
<br>
lot on her mind.<br>
<br>
"…I wonder what I should do now," Mahiru mumbled quietly. She gave a troubled smile<br>
<br>
as she looked into Amane's eyes.<br>
<br>
"I can try my hardest all I want, but my parents won't even look at me. Even if other<br>
<br>
people heap on the praise, call me an angel and whatever else, that doesn't mean a<br>
<br>
thing. Sure, the Mahiru Shiina that they all know, the angel, is idolized and popular,<br>
<br>
but… nobody cares about the real me. And the worst part is that it's all my fault. I set<br>
<br>
myself up this way." She smiled bitterly and grasped the fabric of Amane's shirt tightly.<br>
<br>
"The real me is cowardly and selfish and dull, and… there's just nothing there to like."<br>
<br>
"I like you a fair bit," Amane answered without thinking. Mahiru looked surprised as<br>
<br>
he continued, "I mean, sure, you're not a hundred percent perfect all the time, but I<br>
<br>
really do think you're charming, and I always admire your honesty. You're being too<br>
<br>
hard on yourself." He reached out and tapped her lightly on the forehead. "Besides, if<br>
<br>
you were as selfish as you said, you wouldn't care about what other people think."<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked stunned. But the sorrow had faded from her expression.<br>
<br>
Amane just couldn't understand why Mahiru was always putting herself down. Surely<br>
<br>
anyone could see for themselves that she was a hardworking person and a<br>
<br>
tenderhearted girl. She was honest but considerate, and though she had called herself<br>
<br>
cowardly, Amane knew that Mahiru had been hurt so much before that it made sense<br>
<br>
for her to assume a defensive posture by default.<br>
<br>
And besides, if she really was so dull, why was Amane always agonizing over her?<br>
<br>
He only wished she knew how much more charming she was when she was her honest<br>
<br>
self with him.<br>
<br>
"Don't put yourself down like that," Amane said, gazing into Mahiru's caramel-coloured<br>
<br>
eyes. "After all, there's someone right here who has seen the real you and adores you."<br>
<br>
Mahiru was convinced that nobody loved her. That must have been why she had no<br>
<br>
confidence. But Amane wasn't the only person who liked her—even Chitose had<br>
<br>
grown really attached to her. Mahiru was obviously wrong about herself.<br>
<br>
She looked away from Amane, and her cheeks started to turn red as she pulled herself<br>
<br>
into a ball. Amane realized what he had said and began to blush as well.<br>
<br>
"I—I mean, Chitose and everybody thinks so, too! So don't get the wrong idea," Amane<br>
<br>
explained frantically. "But anyway, it's not just me. My parents, and Chitose and Itsuki,<br>
<br>
too—they all saw the parts of you that aren't the angel you always pretend to be, and<br>
<br>
they all still like being around you! Honestly, you're much more… well, I think your<br>
<br>
personality is much more likable than you think."<br>
<br>
Amane obviously hadn't done a good job explaining himself. Mahiru's face was still<br>
<br>
bright red. Amane had become pretty embarrassed himself—after all, he was the one<br>
<br>
saying all that stuff.<br>
<br>
"So look, if you want to stop trying so hard because your parents are going hate you<br>
<br>
no matter what, then you're welcome to escape to my house whenever you feel like it.<br>
<br>
If my folks know the situation, they'll gladly take you in. You can think of it like time to<br>
<br>
recuperate."<br>
<br>
"…Mm."<br>
<br>
"My mom and dad have really taken a liking to you, so I think they would probably let<br>
<br>
you stay for a long time… Actually, they might not leave you alone until you cheer up.<br>
<br>
None of us can decide for you what you should do about your parents, but we can take<br>
<br>
care of you until you reach a decision and keep supporting you after."<br>
<br>
"Mm…"<br>
<br>
Amane was trying his best not to come across the wrong way, but Mahiru started<br>
<br>
crying again.<br>
<br>
"Wh-why are you crying?"<br>
<br>
"I just… feel so lucky."<br>
<br>
"I dunno; you seem pretty much the opposite to me…"<br>
<br>
Maybe Mahiru was blessed when it came to money, but aside from that, nobody gave<br>
<br>
her anything. She hadn't received one bit of the love she deserved. Honestly, it was a<br>
<br>
wonder she had grown up without becoming twisted and bitter.<br>
<br>
Someone should take care of this Mahiru. And Mahiru should take care of herself, too.<br>
<br>
She should take back a little of what no one offered her, he thought.<br>
<br>
"…In that case, can I make some requests?"<br>
<br>
"What will it be? I'll do whatever I can."<br>
<br>
Mahiru smiled a little. "They're things only you can do, Amane," she murmured. "Like,<br>
<br>
look at me more."<br>
<br>
"I already can't take my eyes off you," he replied. "I'm in awe of everything you do."<br>
<br>
"Also, hold me more."<br>
<br>
He peered down at Mahiru, wondering if that was all.<br>
<br>
"I'm already holding your hand."<br>
<br>
Mahiru stared at Amane for a moment, then looked bashful.<br>
<br>
"For today, hold me with your whole body."<br>
<br>
As soon as she finished her sentence, she wrapped her arms around Amane's neck and<br>
<br>
buried her face in his chest again. Amane was startled for a moment but knew that he<br>
<br>
mustn't get any rude ideas. He swallowed deeply and once again embraced her delicate<br>
<br>
body.<br>

Chapter 25: The Angel’s Metamorphosis<br>
<br>
Mahiru was acting strange the following day as well.<br>
<br>
To be more precise, she didn't appear as dejected as she had the day before, nor did<br>
<br>
she look especially sad. But she was very stiff and seemed wary in a way that was<br>
<br>
difficult to describe.<br>
<br>
Even though he was just sitting beside Mahiru on the living room sofa, Amane felt like<br>
<br>
she was surrounded by an air of crackling tension. When he tried to so much as glance<br>
<br>
at her, she practically jumped, squeezing her favorite cushion tight. However, Amane<br>
<br>
could also tell by looking at the reflection in his smartphone screen that whenever he<br>
<br>
looked away from her, she stared directly at him. 2<br>
<br>
He wondered why she was acting this way—and soon came to the conclusion that it<br>
<br>
must be because of what had happened the day before. 6<br>
<br>
…She must still feel pretty awkward.<br>
<br>
Yesterday, the two of them had embraced—and even though he had been doing it to<br>
<br>
console her, he was worried that it was going to cause problems for their relationship.<br>
<br>
Clinging to him may have been a momentary impulse, and there was a chance she<br>
<br>
regretted it now that she had come back to her senses.<br>
<br>
Recently, they'd had a lot of close, physical contact, but this was the first time she had<br>
<br>
pressed herself against him so boldly. It was inevitable that she would feel a little<br>
<br>
rattled afterward.<br>
<br>
Though it doesn't seem like she hates me for it or anything.<br>
<br>
If she did, he reasoned, she wouldn't be here, in his apartment, sitting next to him.<br>
<br>
But whenever he reached out toward her, she pulled away from him.<br>
<br>
"…Should I just give you some space?"<br>
<br>
"N-no, that's not it."<br>
<br>
He had figured it would be best to keep his distance for a while until she had calmed<br>
<br>
down, and had suggested as much, but Mahiru hurriedly shook her head.<br>
<br>
"Th-this is, well… I'm just ashamed because you saw me in such a pathetic state. I cried<br>
<br>
so hard…"<br>
<br>
"Ah… I see…"<br>
<br>
Apparently, she was embarrassed by all the tears. He recalled that after her sobs had<br>
<br>
subsided the other night, she'd chilled the area around her eyes with ice, so it wouldn't<br>
<br>
swell up. But nothing she did could change the fact that Amane had seen her in that<br>
<br>
vulnerable state, which seemed to really upset her.<br>
<br>
"Well, it didn't really bother me, so—"<br>
<br>
"But it bothers me. It was the biggest mistake of my life to let you see me like that."<br>
<br>
"That's going a little far… Look, if you bottle all those things up, it's obvious that<br>
<br>
eventually you're going to explode, dummy."<br>
<br>
It seemed like Mahiru was about to put on one of her characteristic shows of courage,<br>
<br>
so Amane sighed, and before she could stop him, he reached out and pinched her<br>
<br>
cheek. Her skin was soft and supple between his fingers.<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked confused and nervous. She stared hard at Amane. "Hey, what are you<br>
<br>
doing?"<br>
<br>
"If you don't let your feelings out, you're going to crack at some point. It's okay to let<br>
<br>
other people support you, really. If I'm acceptable, then you can depend on me. If you<br>
<br>
want to cry, I'll cover you up anytime and pretend I can't see you. You need to learn to<br>
<br>
let other people take care of you a little."<br>
<br>
Yesterday, she had let some of what she had pent up come bursting out, but it seemed<br>
<br>
like there was a lot more where that came from. Criticizing Mahiru for her reluctance,<br>
<br>
he pinched her cheek hard as admonishment.<br>
<br>
If she was to say that Amane was unreliable and that she couldn't depend on him, he<br>
<br>
would resign himself to that assessment and accept his dismissal. But as long as that<br>
<br>
wasn't the case, he wanted her to rely on him more and give him a chance to take care<br>
<br>
of her sometimes. He wanted to be there for her, especially when she had nobody else.<br>
<br>
"Yesterday, you nodded like you understood, so why are you backtracking on that<br>
<br>
now? You can depend on me. You are not alone."<br>
<br>
"…Not alone…" Mahiru nodded as she considered his words. She looked positively<br>
<br>
dumbfounded by the notion that she did not have to endure everything by herself.<br>
<br>
Amane ruffled her hair. "I'm always in your corner. If you call them, Chitose and Itsuki<br>
<br>
will show up, too, as will my parents. That's how many people care about you—about<br>
<br>
the real Mahiru."<br>
<br>
Mahiru had lamented the fact that no one wanted her. But that was in the past. Things<br>
<br>
were different now. There were so many people who cherished Mahiru and wanted to<br>
<br>
help her. She had to know how much she meant to everyone.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was silent for a little while as she considered what Amane had said. Then,<br>
<br>
timidly, she looked up at him, with eyes that were searching for reassurance.<br>
<br>
"…And you?"<br>
<br>
"Hmm?"<br>
<br>
"Do you also care about me…?"<br>
<br>
Amane's breath caught in his throat for a moment, then he scratched his cheek. "I<br>
<br>
mean… if we're sitting here together like this, that must mean I care about you quite a<br>
<br>
lot."<br>
<br>
Amane knew he could be pretty aloof. He just wasn't interested in spending a lot of<br>
<br>
energy on a relationship with somebody unless they were really important to him. But<br>
<br>
when he did care about someone, he was always willing to go to whatever lengths<br>
<br>
were necessary to help them.<br>
<br>
And he had cared about Mahiru for a long time now.<br>
<br>
He wanted to take some of the painful burden off of her delicate shoulders. He wanted<br>
<br>
her to smile peacefully. He wanted her to be happy—he wanted to make her happy.<br>
<br>
"…Really…?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru mumbled, burying her face in the cushion. Amane figured it must be pretty<br>
<br>
embarrassing to hear all that out loud. On the other hand, he was the one who'd had<br>
<br>
to say all that out loud, so if anyone was going to be embarrassed, it was him.<br>
<br>
…Though I'm sure that Mahiru won't take it the wrong way.<br>
<br>
He was really worried she might think he was trying to take advantage of her<br>
<br>
vulnerability. Obviously, if that's what she thought, their time together would quickly<br>
<br>
end.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, Mahiru didn't seem to have noticed Amane's anxiety.<br>
<br>
She slowly lifted her face out of the cushion and glanced up at him.<br>
<br>
"…Amane?"<br>
<br>
"What's up?"<br>
<br>
"W-would you, um, turn and face the other way?"<br>
<br>
"Huh? Why?"<br>
<br>
"D-don't worry about why…"<br>
<br>
He was confused as to why she was suddenly asking him to turn around, but he<br>
<br>
obediently turned his back to Mahiru.<br>
<br>
He was waiting anxiously, sitting cross-legged on the sofa, when he felt something soft<br>
<br>
and warm press against his back. That was enough of a surprise to make Amane go<br>
<br>
completely stiff, and when her slender arms wrapped around his chest, he was<br>
<br>
practically petrified.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was obviously hugging him from behind. At the moment, Amane was grateful<br>
<br>
that she wasn't doing it from the front.<br>
<br>
"…Uh, Ma-Mahiru…?" Amane stammered, feeling his heart pounding in his chest.<br>
<br>
She stirred slightly, still clinging to his back. "…So about yesterday… thank you very<br>
<br>
much. I wanted to tell you again how grateful I am."<br>
<br>
Maybe that was why she was holding on to him this way. It was easier for her to thank<br>
<br>
him if he wasn't looking right at her.<br>
<br>
"O-okay…"<br>
<br>
"…You've given me so, so much, Amane."<br>
<br>
"B-but I really didn't do anything special…"<br>
<br>
"You may think it's not important, but it's a big deal to me. So again, thank you."<br>
<br>
"…Sure."<br>
<br>
"I'm so glad to have you by my side. I'm not sure how well I could deal with everything<br>
<br>
if I had to face it alone."<br>
<br>
"…Oh?"<br>
<br>
This was probably Mahiru's way of showing him that she cared.<br>
<br>
Amane was happy that Mahiru felt like she could lean on him. He put his hands over<br>
<br>
hers, wanting to let her know that he had no intention of leaving her alone. When he<br>
<br>
did, her whole body suddenly shuddered.<br>
<br>
Realizing that he had probably gotten too carried away again, Amane pulled his hand<br>
<br>
away in a panic, but Mahiru explained in a voice that was muffled because her face<br>
<br>
was slightly buried in his back. "I-it's okay; I was just surprised…" One of her hands<br>
<br>
roamed around, trying to find Amane's again.<br>
<br>
Feeling relieved, Amane grasped Mahiru's hand, and this time she squeezed him back.<br>
<br>
Amane shivered in surprise, and when he did, he felt Mahiru's head press against his<br>
<br>
back.<br>
<br>
"…Weren't you going to be the one holding me?"<br>
<br>
"I-if you're okay with that…"<br>
<br>
"You're the only person I would ever do something like this with, Amane," she said<br>
<br>
sweetly. "The only one."<br>
<br>
Amane stiffened again. He felt Mahiru trying to bury her face in his back. She must<br>
<br>
have been pretty embarrassed after her sudden confession. Even so, Mahiru didn't let<br>
<br>
him go, and he felt like she must trust him a great deal, and that made him so
<p></p>
self-conscious he wanted to tear his own heart out.<br>
<br>
In fact, Amane was sure he was even more embarrassed than Mahiru was.<br>
<br>
Eventually, Mahiru seemed to calm down, and once again she squeezed Amane's hand<br>
<br>
tightly.<br>
<br>
"…A-anyway, like you promised… please see me for who I really am. Never take your<br>
<br>
eyes off me."<br>
<br>
"S-sure. But I… uh… can't really see you right now…"<br>
<br>
"Well, if you looked at me now, I'd get mad."<br>
<br>
"O-oh, of course… Well, I definitely cannot see you when we sit like this, so… I guess<br>
<br>
you can relax."<br>
<br>
He knew she was probably trying to hide her embarrassment, so he obediently<br>
<br>
followed her instructions. More importantly, trying to take a peek would just upset<br>
<br>
her.<br>
<br>
Besides, Amane thought, covering his face with his free hand, it's better if she doesn't<br>
<br>
see me right now, either. He let out a quiet sigh.<br>
<br>
…At this point, it would be weirder if I didn't fall for her.<br>
<br>
"The new semester is starting soon, huh?"<br>
<br>
It was several days after Mahiru's tearful revelation. She seemed totally back to<br>
<br>
normal—she wasn't acting tense or stealing awkward glances at him or anything. And<br>
<br>
when she looked up from the textbook she was reading and muttered to Amane, it was<br>
<br>
like she had just remembered what day it was.<br>
<br>
Since their talk, the two of them had gotten even closer. Maybe it was because they<br>
<br>
were reading from the same book, but there were probably currently only two or three<br>
<br>
hands' worth of open space between them. They were close enough that Amane could<br>
<br>
feel Mahiru's warmth and smell the sweet scent coming off her. From time to time,<br>
<br>
something soft would bump into him.<br>
<br>
Amane was only just barely holding it together.<br>
<br>
"G-guess it does, y-yeah. Once this weekend is over, it'll be a whole new semester. Kind<br>
<br>
of depressing that there'll be a class change."<br>
<br>
"In what way…?"<br>
<br>
"I'm not good at making friends, so once Itsuki's gone, I won't have anyone to hang out<br>
<br>
with."<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked surprised. "How can you be so sure of that…?"<br>
<br>
"Don't get me wrong, I can carry on a normal conversation as good as the next guy. But<br>
<br>
I never get past being acquaintances, that's all."<br>
<br>
Amane sort of knew how to talk to people all right, but that wasn't the same as making<br>
<br>
friends. He just felt like his personality didn't have much to offer, and he certainly<br>
<br>
wasn't particularly charming, so he'd usually had trouble making friends. He had<br>
<br>
always been more of a background character anyway.<br>
<br>
But he was the type of person who was just fine on his own, and if he was separated<br>
<br>
from Itsuki, that was just the way things went and couldn't be helped. He would simply<br>
<br>
spend the year on his own.<br>
<br>
"…You don't ever take the first step forward, do you, Amane?"<br>
<br>
"Uh—"<br>
<br>
"You're a good person. I think it's a shame that you don't know anyone outside of Itsuki<br>
<br>
and Chitose. People would like you if they just got to know you a little, so you should<br>
<br>
really dial back the whole aloof and indifferent act. There's no reason to keep everyone<br>
<br>
at arm's length all the time. It's a waste of potential." She reached over and brushed<br>
<br>
his bangs out of his eyes.<br>
<br>
Amane felt intensely embarrassed and tried to looked anywhere else instead of at<br>
<br>
Mahiru.<br>
<br>
"…I don't really want to get to know a lot of people, is the thing. I think I'm good with<br>
<br>
being close to a very limited number of people."<br>
<br>
"Why do you feel that way?"<br>
<br>
"Why…?"<br>
<br>
That seemed obvious to him.<br>
<br>
—I'm afraid of being betrayed. Like I was in the past.<br>
<br>
Amane thought it was best to only get close to people he was absolutely sure he could<br>
<br>
trust. That was how he had come to his current social standing.<br>
<br>
"…Well, I don't really need anyone else. As long as I've got you, I'm good."<br>
<br>
"…Huh?"<br>
<br>
"W-wait, that's not what I meant! I was thinking more like, I'm happy as long as I've<br>
<br>
got my close friends, including Itsuki and Chitose, too. I don't want a lot of excitement<br>
<br>
in my life," Amane explained at light speed. He didn't want her to get the wrong<br>
<br>
impression… even if that impression would have been more accurate than he wanted<br>
<br>
to admit.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was looking at him with an expression of mixed relief and absolute<br>
<br>
bewilderment. Her cheeks were turning red. Apparently, she had gotten the wrong<br>
<br>
impression after all.<br>
<br>
"…So you also depend on me, Amane?"<br>
<br>
"You're, like, the only thing holding me up, in more ways than one."<br>
<br>
"When you say it that way, it sounds like I'm quite important in your life, you know."<br>
<br>
She said it like she was criticizing him, but her tone of voice was gentle. She looked at<br>
<br>
him with a gaze that said What a hopeless guy.<br>
<br>
Amane was grappling with some very complicated feelings, so he scratched his cheek<br>
<br>
and tried to change the subject. "Well anyway, how are you feeling about the new<br>
<br>
classes? Are you looking forward to the change?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru blinked several times, then relaxed into a smile. "I am looking forward to the<br>
<br>
class changes."<br>
<br>
"Well, I guess you'll survive no matter which class you end up in, huh?"<br>
<br>
"That's true, but I'd rather do more than survive. Wouldn't you?"<br>
<br>
"I guess you're right."<br>
<br>
Getting along with people on a superficial level didn't mean that Mahiru would<br>
<br>
actually be happy. But she was the kind of person who had to maintain a perfect facade<br>
<br>
no matter how exhausting that could be.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, there was a chance that Mahiru and Chitose would be in the same<br>
<br>
class. That would give Mahiru the chance to spend more time with a friend who had<br>
<br>
seen her true nature. It seemed like the best outcome.<br>
<br>
"Amane, do you know why I'm looking forward to the class changes?"<br>
<br>
Amane was startled to see Mahiru wearing a slightly impish smile, and he put a hand<br>
<br>
to his mouth as he pondered the question.<br>
<br>
"…Because there's a chance you'll be in the same class with Chitose?"<br>
<br>
"Okay, well there's that, too… but it's not the right answer, you dummy," she teased.<br>
<br>
Amane knew she wasn't trying to insult him, but he could hear a slightly peevish tone<br>
<br>
in her words, so he decided he'd better humor her for the time being. He stroked her<br>
<br>
hair, careful not to mess it up. "That's me, a big dummy," he said ruefully.<br>
<br>
"…You're awfully sly, Amane."<br>
<br>
"Wh-what do you mean?"<br>
<br>
"It's okay; you don't have to understand. Just… please don't forget about me once the<br>
<br>
new semester starts, all right?"<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Mahiru shifted, leaning against him with all her weight. He struggled to keep<br>
<br>
his heart from leaping out of his chest at her.<br>
<br>
…What are you trying to do, Mahiru?<br>
<br>
It sounded almost like Mahiru was planning something. Amane suddenly had a bad<br>
<br>
feeling about the next week's opening ceremony. He'd been hoping that the coming<br>
<br>
semester would be a peaceful one.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 26: You Are Not Alone<br>
<br>
The day before the start of the new semester, Amane was slovenly sprawled out on his<br>
<br>
sofa, lazily watching the news on television.<br>
<br>
He was feeling carefree despite the upcoming school year, both because the weather<br>
<br>
had settled down into the perfect climate for napping, and because no matter what<br>
<br>
class he was assigned, he knew his social standing wouldn't change.<br>
<br>
Through eyes blurry from yawning, he stared at the TV, where a serious-looking<br>
<br>
announcer was reporting on the best times to see the cherry blossoms. The broadcast<br>
<br>
covered where the viewing was currently best, how many people were expected to go<br>
<br>
out to see the trees, and which regions were in full bloom. It all sounded very lively.<br>
<br>
Apparently, the region he was living in was close to full bloom, too. According to the<br>
<br>
news report, the flowers had blossomed quite early this year. It was a surprise to see<br>
<br>
them out before the start of the new semester. It reminded Amane of his hometown,<br>
<br>
actually, where they usually bloomed this time of year.<br>
<br>
Cherry blossoms, huh…?<br>
<br>
Amane had never really cared about the changing of the seasons all that much, but he<br>
<br>
could understand why some people found it charming. He did have some fondness for<br>
<br>
the cherry blossoms and liked to see the pale petals.<br>
<br>
Come to think of it, there was a row of cherry trees not that far from here, near the river…<br>
<br>
Amane slowly sat up.<br>
<br>
I really loafed around over spring break, huh? I guess I shouldn't be surprised…<br>
<br>
Aside from a moderate amount of weight training and some light jogging, he hadn't<br>
<br>
gone anywhere or done anything.<br>
<br>
Amane had always preferred the indoors, but he'd basically spent the entire holiday<br>
<br>
sitting in his apartment with Mahiru, so he figured it would probably do him some<br>
<br>
good to go outside for a change.<br>
<br>
He was annoyed that it had taken a news report to get him moving, but today was the<br>
<br>
last day of spring break, so if he didn't seize this opportunity, he would have to wait a<br>
<br>
whole week. Really, he had no choice but to just go for it—no time like the present,<br>
<br>
after all.<br>
<br>
Amane rolled off the sofa and changed into appropriate street clothes. He was going<br>
<br>
alone, so he didn't bother getting into mystery man mode.<br>
<br>
Since he was just one lone guy, getting ready was simple. After he changed, he grabbed<br>
<br>
his bag, stuck his phone and wallet inside, then prepared to leave.<br>
<br>
Just as Amane opened the door, a ripple of golden hair filled his vision.<br>
<br>
"Oh, Amane, where are you going?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru was in her usual clothes, so she was probably actually just on her way over to<br>
<br>
his place. It would be pretty awkward to set off now.<br>
<br>
"Mahiru? Oh, I thought I would go for a bit of a walk. It's the last day of spring break,<br>
<br>
you know. Today's it."<br>
<br>
"I see. You were kind of a hermit over the break, weren't you?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, hush… A-anyway, I won't be back for a couple hours, so if you want to chill at my<br>
<br>
place, that's fine. What are you up to?"<br>
<br>
Amane thought that his apartment had more entertainment options, so she might<br>
<br>
appreciate that, but on the other hand, she would probably feel more comfortable in<br>
<br>
her own home, so… he decided to leave it up to her.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was staring silently up at him. Her eyes suggested that she might have<br>
<br>
something to say.<br>
<br>
Amane wasn't sure what he was supposed to do. Nervously, he scratched his cheek.<br>
<br>
"Wh-what's up? You look like you want to come with me or something."<br>
<br>
Amane had been about to play it off like a joke when Mahiru suddenly nodded.<br>
<br>
"…I do."<br>
<br>
"Eh?!"<br>
<br>
A shrill, strangled sound spilled out from Amane's throat.<br>
<br>
"But if you don't want me to…," Mahiru muttered, "that's fine, too, I guess."<br>
<br>
"I-it's not that I don't you want to… It's just… How can I put this? If someone sees us<br>
<br>
together, the rumors will start up again. Aren't you worried?"<br>
<br>
"Rumors are rumors. People are free to think whatever they want."<br>
<br>
"G-got it," Amane replied, caught off guard by Mahiru's sudden boldness. "Well, you<br>
<br>
probably want to go get ready, so how about we leave in an hour?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru was wearing her normal, casual clothes. She looked great just like that, but<br>
<br>
Amane figured that, being a girl, she would probably want time to change. Plus, he<br>
<br>
decided he ought to go make himself look presentable if he was going to be walking<br>
<br>
beside her. Otherwise, he would end up causing her double the trouble.<br>
<br>
I'd better do something about my hair, he thought as he touched his bangs.<br>
<br>
Mahiru frowned, maybe because she had realized the real reason he wanted to delay<br>
<br>
their departure. "Sorry to make you go through all that trouble for my sake…"<br>
<br>
"Eh, don't worry about it. Besides, it'll be a good change of pace to take a walk. And I<br>
<br>
think the scenery will look nicer if you're walking with me."<br>
<br>
It wouldn't really take too much effort to clean himself up, and it was worth it to spend<br>
<br>
time with Mahiru. He thought that she would look even more lovely than the cherry<br>
<br>
blossoms. Having a beauty like that beside him would make it all worth it, so he didn't<br>
<br>
begrudge her the extra effort.<br>
<br>
"All right then, so I'll see you in bit?"<br>
<br>
"O-okay."<br>
<br>
Mahiru seemed quite reticent, but Amane just gave her a pat on the head and then<br>
<br>
ducked back into his apartment to change and work on his hairdo.<br>
<br>
Both of them were finished getting ready after about an hour, so Amane and Mahiru<br>
<br>
set off on a leisurely walk.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was dressed for spring. Her white dress was adorned with lace, and she wore<br>
<br>
a light-pink cardigan on top. The dress came to just above her knees, which was a little<br>
<br>
short for Mahiru, but she had on stockings, so her legs were still covered. She had even<br>
<br>
gone to the trouble of braiding her hair into a half-up style. For such a simple outing,<br>
<br>
she had certainly taken the time to compose herself, and Amane couldn't help but<br>
<br>
marvel at the beauty walking beside him.<br>
<br>
"Is something the matter?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, you just look very stylish today, as usual."<br>
<br>
"…Thank you."<br>
<br>
Mahiru's cheeks flushed slightly, and she turned away, looking every bit the innocent<br>
<br>
young damsel.<br>
<br>
Owing to her striking appearance, Amane could feel eyes on them as they walked<br>
<br>
down the road. Mahiru didn't seem bothered by the attention, but when she looked up<br>
<br>
at him, he noticed that she was still slightly flustered. "S-so, did you have a destination<br>
<br>
in mind?"<br>
<br>
"Well, I thought we might go down to the river and check out the cherry blossoms. I<br>
<br>
heard they've bloomed earlier than usual this year, and right now is the best time to<br>
<br>
see them."<br>
<br>
"…Oh really?"<br>
<br>
"So I thought I'd go take a look. Does that sound okay?"<br>
<br>
"O-of course. I'm following you."<br>
<br>
He felt sort of awkward, but when she gripped his sleeve tightly, all trivial thoughts<br>
<br>
vanished from his mind.<br>
<br>
Her innocent gesture and endearing gaze made his heart leap suddenly in his chest<br>
<br>
and his breath catch in his throat.<br>
<br>
…This is really a problem. She's way too cute.<br>
<br>
Obviously, Mahiru was quite beautiful, but since he'd gotten to know her, Amane had<br>
<br>
only grown more infatuated. And when she touched him like that, it only intensified<br>
<br>
his feelings.<br>
<br>
Amane brushed her delicate hand off of his sleeve and clasped his own hand around<br>
<br>
it, struggling to keep his excitement in check.<br>
<br>
"Come on, let's go."<br>
<br>
"Y-yeah."<br>
<br>
It was spring break, so there were a lot of people out. As they held hands so they<br>
<br>
wouldn't lose each other, Mahiru lowered her gaze bashfully, and Amane squeezed 3<br>
<br>
tightly and tried to keep his cool.<br>
<br>
When they arrived at the riverside not far from their apartment complex, the place<br>
<br>
was crowded, just like they had expected. For students, it was the final day of spring<br>
<br>
break, and for adults, it was the perfect time for a flower-viewing party. The area<br>
<br>
bustled with people sitting on tarps and blankets, enjoying the occasion.<br>
<br>
The cherry blossoms were nearly in full bloom, and the pale petals danced before<br>
<br>
Amane's eyes.<br>
<br>
"…Incredible! It's even better than I expected."<br>
<br>
Amane mumbled to himself as he watched the cherry petals flutter in the breeze. He<br>
<br>
wasn't particularly interested in flowers, but he appreciated beauty when he saw it,<br>
<br>
and the delicate pink petals were undeniably beautiful.<br>
<br>
He sighed and glanced over at Mahiru, who was staring wordlessly up at the cherry<br>
<br>
trees. The breathtaking colors were reflected in her wide eyes. Amane wondered what<br>
<br>
she was thinking.<br>
<br>
"Mahiru?"<br>
<br>
When he called out to her, she blinked rapidly, then turned to him in surprise. There<br>
<br>
was a strange air about her.<br>
<br>
"What's up? You looked like you were zoning out."<br>
<br>
"…N-nothing," Mahiru answered. "I was just… I was thinking that these really are<br>
<br>
cherry trees."<br>
<br>
"That's because they are…," he said incredulously. "Did… did something happen? You<br>
<br>
looked sort of different, and… I dunno. I was worried."<br>
<br>
"No, it's nothing important." Mahiru frowned. "…I just don't like… cherry blossoms…<br>
<br>
or spring very much, you know?"<br>
<br>
"Ah, sorry, I didn't realize. I guess I shouldn't have invited you."<br>
<br>
Amane immediately regretted taking her, but Mahiru slowly shook her head side to side.<br>
<br>
"No, I don't mean that I hate the flowers themselves or anything… It's just, when I look<br>
<br>
at the cherry blossoms, I'm reminded that I don't have any happy memories of them."<br>
<br>
"No happy memories?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, because I didn't have anyone to make them with."<br>
<br>
Mahiru smiled in a way that only made her look forlorn. She didn't seem upset. Just<br>
<br>
sad, like she had come to terms with her loneliness a long time ago. Seeing her like<br>
<br>
that put an acrid taste in Amane's mouth.<br>
<br>
"Entrance ceremonies… and graduations, too, actually. I was alone for all of them. Miss<br>
<br>
Koyuki, the maid, didn't start her shift until the afternoon, and my parents always had<br>
<br>
more important things to do. My father would usually at least stop by to say<br>
<br>
congratulations or something, but…"<br>
<br>
Mahiru's smile was small and bitter, and she looked up at the blossoming cherry trees.<br>
<br>
"When everyone else was holding hands with their parents under the cherry trees, I<br>
<br>
would walk home alone. And nobody was waiting for me…" Mahiru hung her head. "So<br>
<br>
you see, I don't really like spring very much. It reminds me that I don't have anyone.<br>
<br>
That probably sounds beyond pitiful…"<br>
<br>
When Mahiru had finished, Amane couldn't help giving her hand a little squeeze. He<br>
<br>
wanted to remind her that he was still there.<br>
<br>
There were many things that he would have liked to say to Mahiru's parents, but right<br>
<br>
now he wanted to make sure she knew that she was not alone.<br>
<br>
"Well I'm here with you right now. I'm even holding your hand."<br>
<br>
He stared into Mahiru's caramel-coloured eyes.<br>
<br>
She blinked dramatically, and her face twisted into a smile. "I suppose you are…," she<br>
<br>
murmured as she squeezed his hand a little tighter.<br>
<br>
Amane gave her a reassuring smile, and with his other hand, he reached out and<br>
<br>
stroked Mahiru's hair.<br>
<br>
"And hey, if that's not enough, I can always call Itsuki and Chitose. And my parents live<br>
<br>
pretty far away, but I'm sure if I called them, they would definitely come running…"<br>
<br>
"I-it's fine. You don't need to do all that."<br>
<br>
"No? All right then. Sounds like you'll just have to settle for me."<br>
<br>
"…I'm not settling."<br>
<br>
"Oh. Sorry, I—"<br>
<br>
"No, that's not what I meant… I was trying to say that it's not settling, being with you."<br>
<br>
"O-oh?"<br>
<br>
Amane could feel a familiar heat rushing to his cheeks. He still maintained the pretense<br>
<br>
that he had no amorous intentions toward Mahiru, but hearing her tell him that she<br>
<br>
wanted him to be with her, holding her hand… It filled his stomach with butterflies.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's expression softened into a small smile as she squeezed his hand and gazed<br>
<br>
bashfully at the falling petals. "…I think I'm starting to like the cherry blossoms, just a<br>
<br>
little bit."<br>
<br>
Amane gently wrapped her small hand up in his.<br>
<br>
"Is that so?<br>
 <br>
Chapter 27: The Start of the New Semester<br>
<br>
"Listen, I'm not a kid anymore, you know." Amane's exasperation was obvious from the<br>
<br>
way he answered his mother's phone call. He was about to attend the school entrance<br>
<br>
ceremony that marked the start of his second year of high school, after all.<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't decide whether he was more impressed or irritated by her ability to<br>
<br>
time her call for the one free moment in his busy morning routine. She worries too<br>
<br>
much, he thought as he sank into the sofa.<br>
<br>
His mother had gotten used to the idea of him living alone, but she was clearly still<br>
<br>
concerned that an old wound of his might have opened again, dredging up memories<br>
<br>
of something from his second year of middle school.<br>
<br>
As far as Amane was concerned, though the scar ached sometimes, it never bothered<br>
<br>
him much. And more importantly, he didn't want to worry his parents.<br>
<br>
"I'm fine. Really—I'll be all right on my own."<br>
<br>
"You come tell me anytime it gets tough, okay? Oh, even better, you can lean on sweet<br>
<br>
Mahiru!"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, yeah…"<br>
<br>
Why is she so hung up on Mahiru and me?<br>
<br>
His mother had taken a liking to Mahiru and clearly wanted them to spend more time<br>
<br>
together, but Amane felt like it was really none of her business. When it came to<br>
<br>
matters of romance, he didn't ask for or want any parental meddling, even if she only<br>
<br>
meant well.<br>
<br>
Most of all, Amane didn't want his mother to figure out just how fond of Mahiru he<br>
<br>
really was, so he opted to kept quiet and didn't engage.<br>
<br>
"I bet Mahiru would be very receptive."<br>
<br>
"Uh-huh…"<br>
<br>
"At any rate, if you're having a rough time, make sure to ask someone for help, okay? It<br>
<br>
can be anyone. I still think Mahiru would be just perfect, but—"<br>
<br>
"Look, I've gotta go soon, so I'm hanging up. Thanks for worrying about me so early in<br>
<br>
the morning."<br>
<br>
Amane didn't want his mother speculating about his relationship with Mahiru any<br>
<br>
further, so he quickly thanked her and ended the call. He could already imagine her on<br>
<br>
the other end of the line, probably pouting in displeasure.<br>
<br>
She was concerned about him, but she was worrying way too much.<br>
<br>
His scars did ache, but not so much that it would bring him to his knees.<br>
<br>
Besides, it wouldn't bother him if he just didn't think about it.<br>
<br>
…Better to not reach out if I don't need to.<br>
<br>
As long as the people I trust stay with me, everything'll be fine.<br>
<br>
Amane wasn't worried about the class changes for the new semester. After all, there<br>
<br>
was nothing he could do, so he'd decided to do his best to accept whatever came.<br>
<br>
Staring at his own gloomy, melancholic reflection in the darkened screen of his phone,<br>
<br>
Amane smiled bleakly.<br>
<br>
If Chitose and Itsuki saw me like this, they'd slap me right on the back, he thought as he<br>
<br>
stood up from the sofa and left for the first day of school.<br>
<br>
Walking to school after two weeks off felt a bit nostalgic. After arriving, Amane<br>
<br>
approached the central bulletin board, intending to check the rosters for each class<br>
<br>
posted there.<br>
<br>
Although he had come a little earlier than usual, it was the start of the new semester,<br>
<br>
so plenty of other students were already there—and surprisingly, one of them was his<br>
<br>
friend Itsuki, who emerged from the crowd to greet him.<br>
<br>
"Yo, what's up, Amane. Looks like you just got here."<br>
<br>
"Morning. Is the sky falling or something? I can't believe you got here before I did."<br>
<br>
"My dad chased me out of the house," Itsuki replied with a small grin. "He said I should<br>
<br>
at least be early for the first day." He shrugged, as if there was nothing interesting<br>
<br>
about it.<br>
<br>
Itsuki was at odds with his father, as usual. Since meeting Chitose, he didn't seem<br>
<br>
inclined to do anything his parents wanted. Itsuki's father stubbornly refused to<br>
<br>
approve of his relationship with Chitose, and ever since then, the two of them never<br>
<br>
saw eye to eye. Of course, Itsuki's father could be pretty stern, even before his son had<br>
<br>
started dating, Amane thought that he was overall an earnest and sensible man—and<br>
<br>
a decent parent.<br>
<br>
That said, Itsuki's current situation really made Amane appreciate his relationship<br>
<br>
with his own parents. They could be more than a little overbearing at times, but on<br>
<br>
the whole, they respected their son's wishes, and Amane almost never argued with<br>
<br>
them. After all, they had gone to a lot of trouble to send him to school far away from<br>
<br>
his hometown. And they never gave him a hard time about who he associated with—<br>
<br>
if anything, they fully supported him on that front.<br>
<br>
Amane hadn't told his parents about his feelings toward Mahiru, but they were<br>
<br>
obviously quite taken with her—even openly mentioning that she'd make a wonderful<br>
<br>
daughter-in-law. If by some slim chance he did one day happen to find himself in that<br>
<br>
sort of relationship with Mahiru, Amane was sure his parents would approve.<br>
<br>
Amane was well aware that he was blessed with a loving family.<br>
<br>
…Considering Mahiru's situation, I've seriously got it made, huh?<br>
<br>
Amane fell into an uncomfortable silence as he recalled the chilling expression he'd<br>
<br>
seen Mahiru's mother brandish, only for Itsuki to flash him a flippant grin. It seemed<br>
<br>
like he had already regained his usual cheer.<br>
<br>
"Well, my dad's not worth worrying about. Come on, let's check out the class lists."<br>
<br>
"From the way you're smiling, I can more or less guess what got posted."<br>
<br>
Amane shot Itsuki a weary look when he saw his friend's ordinary smile had become<br>
<br>
a devious grin, then searched for his own name among the crowd of students who<br>
<br>
were doing the same.<br>
<br>
It didn't take him long to spot his name. As he started confirming who his classmates<br>
<br>
would be for the year, Itsuki's impish smile began to make more sense.<br>
<br>
There were many familiar names on the roll sheet.<br>
<br>
Several belonged to students who had been in his class last year—namely, Itsuki and<br>
<br>
the boy who was often referred to as the prince, Yuuta Kadowaki.<br>
<br>
Amane also spied Chitose's name, which certainly explained Itsuki's good mood.<br>
<br>
And there was one more he recognized.<br>
<br>
Mahiru Shiina—the name of his next-door neighbor who always looked after him, the<br>
<br>
secret object of his affections.<br>
<br>
If I didn't know any better, I'd swear somebody planned it all out. 3<br>
<br>
Of course, class assignments were decided by the school administration, meaning<br>
<br>
Amane and his friends had no say where they ended up, but he never expected to be<br>
<br>
placed with so many familiar faces.<br>
<br>
"We got real lucky, didn't we, Amane?"<br>
<br>
"I don't know what's so great about it. I guess it's a relief to have you with me."<br>
<br>
"What's up, you getting embarrassed for once?"<br>
<br>
"Shut it. And if anyone's lucky, it's gotta be you, right? Being in the same class as<br>
<br>
Chitose and all."<br>
<br>
"I really am, man. I was worried that they'd heartlessly tear us two lovers apart…"<br>
<br>
"On second thought, maybe putting some distance between you two would've been<br>
<br>
better for everybody."<br>
<br>
With this excitable couple around, there wouldn't be a single moment of boredom—<br>
<br>
or peace. And their constant displays of affection were almost guaranteed to bother<br>
<br>
all the single students.<br>
<br>
Amane was happy to be in the same class as his friends Itsuki and Chitose, but on the<br>
<br>
other hand, he could already tell that this year was going to be turbulent and difficult.<br>
<br>
"Why so harsh? Ah, don't tell me—it's because you're single, right?"<br>
<br>
"Try saying that to the other guys. If looks could kill, man."<br>
<br>
"I'm joking, I'm joking! But seriously, this turned out pretty great, yeah? You finally get<br>
<br>
to be in the same class as the girl you like."<br>
<br>
"…Shut up." Amane turned sharply away from Itsuki's teasing.<br>
<br>
A cheerful voice interrupted their banter. "I could be wrong, but Fujimiya looks a little<br>
<br>
pissed, doesn't he?" There was a quiet laugh. "He'll start to hate you if you tease him<br>
<br>
too much, Itsuki."<br>
<br>
Amane felt himself frown as he looked up and saw Yuuta, the class prince, standing<br>
<br>
beside Itsuki with one hand resting on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
It was impossible to miss the flickering glances gathering on him in the hallway. This<br>
<br>
level of attention must have been completely normal to him, because he didn't seem<br>
<br>
bothered in the slightest. Yuuta was just showing Amane a friendly smile.<br>
<br>
"Morning. We're in the same class again this year. Looking forward to it."<br>
<br>
It didn't seem like a very significant interaction. He had seen Itsuki and Amane<br>
<br>
conversing by the bulletin board and had come over to greet them. Yuuta got along<br>
<br>
okay with Itsuki, so that wasn't strange, but it was unusual for him to be so friendly<br>
<br>
with Amane.<br>
<br>
Amane felt a little uncomfortable talking with such a popular guy. There was nothing<br>
<br>
wrong with Yuuta as a person, but Amane disliked attracting too much attention.<br>
<br>
Besides, making new friends like this at the beginning of the new semester threatened<br>
<br>
to remind him of the past. The pain welling up slowly but steadily from the deep<br>
<br>
crevices of his chest was nostalgic. It was a feeling he thought he had buried a long<br>
<br>
time ago.<br>
<br>
"…Fujimiya?"<br>
<br>
"Eh? Ah, sorry; I spaced out for a second. Hope we have a good year."<br>
<br>
Amane smiled back weakly at Yuuta, who was now frowning slightly, looking worried<br>
<br>
for a moment before finally letting his face soften into a relieved smile.<br>
<br>
You should save a smile like that for your fangirls, Amane thought briefly. But Yuuta<br>
<br>
looked genuinely happy, so Amane was also relieved.<br>
<br>
At that point, a couple other boys came over, and Yuuta left to chat with them.<br>
<br>
Itsuki, who had been silent until then, had his eyes fixed on Amane, as if he was<br>
<br>
forming some conjecture. "Is it just me, or are you on your guard around Yuuta?"<br>
<br>
"…No, that's not it. It's just… I was thinking how weird it is for him to try to be friends<br>
<br>
with me."<br>
<br>
"Really, dude? You're always way too hard on yourself. Look, it's not like Yuuta has<br>
<br>
some ulterior motive for being friendly with you, ya know? Not everyone who acts<br>
<br>
nice is looking to gain some advantage. You're one cagy guy, Amane."<br>
<br>
"I'm sure that's true," Amane replied, "but—" The moment he noticed Itsuki glaring at<br>
<br>
him with exasperation, he gulped back down the words he was going to say next. —<br>
<br>
But there are people like that out there.<br>
<br>
Not that he suspected Yuuta was one of them or anything.<br>
<br>
They had only spent the past year as classmates in passing, but even so, Amane knew<br>
<br>
that Yuuta was a good guy. With his kind, honest, charming personality, it was hardly<br>
<br>
a mystery why the boy was popular, and no wonder he had lots of friends.<br>
<br>
Still, this particular time of year brought back many unpleasant memories for Amane,<br>
<br>
and it made him extra suspicious, even when he knew there was no reason to be.<br>
<br>
"It doesn't really have anything to do with what kind of guy Kadowaki is. I'm just shy,<br>
<br>
so I get spooked when someone suddenly wants to talk to me."<br>
<br>
"Well, I guess that's fair. You are the shy type. The first time we talked, you got all<br>
<br>
wound up like a nervous cat."<br>
<br>
"Who're you calling a cat?"<br>
<br>
"Tell me I'm wrong. Timid and quiet as could be as long as no one touched you, but the<br>
<br>
moment someone made contact, bam, your hackles would be up."<br>
<br>
Amane frowned at Itsuki's analogy. As a cat lover, he didn't appreciate his sulky<br>
<br>
attitude being lumped in with such adorable, free-spirited creatures.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, I think you'd get along with Yuuta if you gave him a chance. Since middle<br>
<br>
school, we've been in the same class for three years, so I can vouch for him. He's a good<br>
<br>
dude."<br>
<br>
"I can tell that just by watching him, but it's my feelings that are the problem. Besides,<br>
<br>
I've never really talked with him…"<br>
<br>
"I'm pretty sure it won't be long before he changes that himself."<br>
<br>
"Wait, why?"<br>
<br>
"What do you mean? It's 'cause even Yuuta can tell you're a good guy."<br>
<br>
Itsuki said that with another big grin, but Amane frowned reflexively. He simply didn't<br>
<br>
understand.<br>
<br>
"Mooorniiing! Looks like we're in the same class this year!"<br>
<br>
After Amane entered his new classroom, found his assigned seat, and checked that<br>
<br>
there were no mistakes in his school paperwork, Chitose approached him, looking like<br>
<br>
she'd just gotten out of bed.<br>
<br>
This year, both Chitose and Itsuki were in his class, so he knew this was only the first<br>
<br>
of many boisterous and heartburn-inducing days.<br>
<br>
"Good morning. You didn't come with Itsuki today, huh?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, I overslept. Honestly, I totally forgot about the new semester, and my mom had<br>
<br>
to wake me up. Where's Itsuki?"<br>
<br>
"He went to the vending machines a minute ago."<br>
<br>
"Gotcha. Guess I'll message him and ask for a milk tea. Ah, Mahirun, Mahirun! We're in<br>
<br>
the same class this year! I can't wait!"<br>
<br>
Waving her hands excitedly, Chitose, who wasn't bashful around anyone, bounded over<br>
<br>
to Mahiru, who had just entered the classroom. Mahiru, surrounded by a slew of boys<br>
<br>
and girls, blinked in surprise. Everyone around her stiffened when they heard Chitose<br>
<br>
address her so casually, but when Mahiru reacted normally and instantly donned her<br>
<br>
angelic smile, it was clear that Chitose was permitted to talk to her that way. That was<br>
<br>
when the crowd's mood changed to one of jealousy.<br>
<br>
Watching Chitose rush over to Mahiru with so much energy that early in the morning<br>
<br>
left Amane feeling equal parts frustration and admiration. When his gaze fell on Mahiru,<br>
<br>
their eyes met for a moment, and he thought he saw a flicker of change in her soft<br>
<br>
smile. But the next instant, she shifted her gaze back to Chitose with a tender look in<br>
<br>
her eyes.<br>
<br>
"Mahirun, school lets out early today, so let's go eat crepes on the way home! The crepe<br>
<br>
place in front of the station is super tasty!"<br>
<br>
"That sounds nice. I'd like to go if you really don't mind."<br>
<br>
It might have been Amane's imagination, but he thought he saw her glance in his<br>
<br>
direction again. As far as Amane was concerned, she certainly didn't need to get his<br>
<br>
permission every time she wanted to go somewhere, and he had no intention of being<br>
<br>
a burden who kept her from going out when she wanted. He could always eat fast food<br>
<br>
or go to a convenience store for lunch. Mahiru was cultivating a budding friendship,<br>
<br>
and Amane was happy for her.<br>
<br>
Chitose was very good at connecting with people like that, so he hoped they would<br>
<br>
have fun together—and that she would show Mahiru, who didn't typically hang out<br>
<br>
with many other people, a good time without wearing her out too much.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was probably the one who would benefit most from having Chitose in the same<br>
<br>
class. She was already smiling happily, despite Chitose's intensity. Amane felt a smile<br>
<br>
of his own slide into place.<br>
<br>
The first day of the new semester consisted of an opening ceremony
<p></p>
then self-introductions and general announcements in the classroom. Once that was all over,<br>
<br>
the students were dismissed.<br>
<br>
Since school let out before lunchtime, Amane had been planning to eat with Mahiru, but<br>
<br>
instead, he bought a boxed lunch from the convenience store he had come to rely on<br>
<br>
less and less frequently. After getting home and devouring his basic meal, he sprawled<br>
<br>
out lazily on the sofa.<br>
<br>
Amane had many acquaintances in his new class, and from what he could tell, most of<br>
<br>
the other students were on the calm side, so it seemed like he would be able to manage<br>
<br>
one way or another. It was a huge relief to know so many of his classmates. It would<br>
<br>
have been depressing to spend a year's worth of classes without even one friend.<br>
<br>
Amane had enough self-awareness to understand he had a gloomy disposition, so he<br>
<br>
expected it would be quite a hurdle to make new friends and get to know them. He<br>
<br>
had a hard time trusting people in general.<br>
<br>
While idly thinking about what a feat it was to have befriended Itsuki and lauding his<br>
<br>
past self for his foresight, Amane slowly let his eyes slide shut.<br>
<br>
Being in an unfamiliar classroom had been a bit taxing. Coupled with post-meal<br>
<br>
sleepiness, it meant that Amane drifted off in no time.<br>
<br>
For Amane, brushing up against the memories he had sealed away brought a small yet<br>
<br>
sharp pain, like grazing a hangnail.<br>
<br>
Normally, he was able to forget about them and chase them to the depths of his mind<br>
<br>
by focusing on the many good things in his life.<br>
<br>
Since meeting Mahiru, he had barely even thought about them anymore, and when the<br>
<br>
memories did reappear, they were like bubbles that burst the moment they hit the<br>
<br>
surface of the water. Those pinpricks only lingered briefly. The recent, sudden increase<br>
<br>
might have been due to the new school year, or maybe it had been triggered when he<br>
<br>
learned about Mahiru's past. Or possibly because he'd realized that Itsuki, who had<br>
<br>
been his first new friend after everything had happened, was also buddies with Yuuta.<br>
<br>
"Let's have a great year."<br>
<br>
There had been another boy once who had said that and extended a hand to Amane.<br>
<br>
At the time, Amane had been more trusting—and less wary of others. He had always<br>
<br>
been surrounded by good people and never learned to recognize when someone<br>
<br>
meant to hurt him.<br>
<br>
And so he didn't doubt the boy. He didn't doubt any of them.<br>
<br>
"—You… from the very start—"<br>
<br>
Amane jolted awake, and the words he knew came next faded away.<br>
<br>
Through blurry eyes, he could see spring sunlight streaming in through the window,<br>
<br>
gently illuminating the dark, familiar apartment.<br>
<br>
There was no one there except Amane and no sound other than his own breathing,<br>
<br>
which was rougher than usual.<br>
<br>
He let out a heavy sigh as he looked at the clock and noted that about an hour had<br>
<br>
passed since he'd dozed off. A considerable nap, but Amane still felt completely<br>
<br>
exhausted, probably because of his bad dreams.<br>
<br>
Given how tired his body and mind felt, he could have easily gone to sleep again, but<br>
<br>
he had suddenly lost any inclination to try and rest.<br>
<br>
I should at least wash my face and clear my head.<br>
<br>
Hoping that a little fresh water might wash away any lingering dregs of melancholy,<br>
<br>
Amane headed for the sink.<br>
<br>
"…You don't look so good, Amane."<br>
<br>
Although he had washed up, the hazy feeling in Amane's chest hadn't cleared up. It had<br>
<br>
only receded just enough for him to stow it in the depths of his heart and wait to forget<br>
<br>
about it again. He thought he'd managed to wipe any traces of it from his expression<br>
<br>
so he wouldn't arouse Mahiru's suspicions, but she was very perceptive and wouldn't<br>
<br>
be fooled so easily. She had come by after her outing with Chitose, and when they had<br>
<br>
settled down after dinner, she studied Amane's face and questioned him.<br>
<br>
"…Are you feeling sick?"<br>
<br>
"No, nothing like that… Uh, it's just that… I took a nap, but I had kind of a bad dream, I<br>
<br>
guess."<br>
<br>
"Oh, you had a nightmare?" She gave him an inquisitive look.<br>
<br>
"Mm, sort of." Amane shook his head. "Not a big deal, really. No need to worry." It was<br>
<br>
a thin excuse.<br>
<br>
Mahiru is sharp. She'll leave it at that if it's clear that's what I want. She's the type to let<br>
<br>
up if she knows I don't want to talk right now.<br>
<br>
Amane didn't want to shut her out completely, but it was still a sore spot for him, so<br>
<br>
he kept her at a bit of a distance. He knew Mahiru wouldn't press the issue.<br>
<br>
Mahiru seemed to have sensed that Amane had no intention of opening up at the<br>
<br>
moment, and she was simply staring intently at him with focused caramel-coloured<br>
<br>
eyes. She clearly wasn't angry, or sad, or troubled. It made him feel a little awkward,<br>
<br>
but Mahiru didn't stop staring, as if to say she understood what he was going through.<br>
<br>
"What is it?"<br>
<br>
"Nothing; just thinking that your hair looks especially soft."<br>
<br>
"Huh?"<br>
<br>
He had been on his guard, wondering what she was going to say next, so this sudden<br>
<br>
non sequitur caught him by surprise. He had been anticipating an interrogation of<br>
<br>
some sort, so the mention of his hair left him struggling to respond.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was examining Amane's hair with her usual expression.<br>
<br>
"Can I touch it?"<br>
<br>
"What is this, all of a sudden…? I mean, you can if you like, but—"<br>
<br>
"Oh really? In that case, come here."<br>
<br>
Mahiru moved to the edge of the sofa and patted her lap.<br>
<br>
Amane responded once more with, "Huh?"<br>
<br>
He didn't understand.<br>
<br>
"Put your head here so I can reach."<br>
<br>
"No, no, no."<br>
<br>
Mahiru stared quietly at Amane, who shook his head sharply at this incredibly unusual<br>
<br>
development. Amane was extremely confused as to why she had suddenly proposed<br>
<br>
such a thing. Mahiru, on the other hand, seemed perfectly calm, which only heightened<br>
<br>
his confusion.<br>
<br>
"Is there something wrong with my lap?"<br>
<br>
"N-no, that's not—"<br>
<br>
He quickly shook his head when he detected the displeasure in her voice.<br>
<br>
The opportunity to rest your head in the lap of the person you like is a rare moment<br>
<br>
of exceptional good luck.<br>
<br>
But whether he should simply go along and accept the favor was a different question<br>
<br>
entirely. No matter how much physical contact they'd had before, laying his head in<br>
<br>
her lap was a whole new level of intimacy. There was a good chance he would die of<br>
<br>
embarrassment. Their hug the other day had been urgent and for the sake of soothing<br>
<br>
and comforting Mahiru, so he hadn't felt too self-conscious then, but this was a whole<br>
<br>
other matter.<br>
<br>
"It's fine; just get over here already."<br>
<br>
"N-no, that's…"<br>
<br>
"Amane."<br>
<br>
"…Fine."<br>
<br>
He had been trying to resist, but his willpower crumbled the moment Mahiru called his<br>
<br>
name with a smile. Her latent powers of persuasion revealed themselves once again<br>
<br>
as she invitingly smoothed the fabric of her skirt, wiping out all remaining pockets of<br>
<br>
resistance.<br>
<br>
Thank goodness she's wearing a long skirt, he thought from the bottom of his heart as<br>
<br>
he hesitantly went to lie down on the sofa to rest his head in Mahiru's lap. He had his<br>
<br>
back to her, looking out over her knees, as he felt the firm softness of her thighs.<br>
<br>
Her slim legs, lean but still undeniably feminine, supported the weight of his head<br>
<br>
perfectly. Her lap was at just the right height, and he could smell her faint, sweet scent<br>
<br>
and feel the heat of her body. The last of his willpower dissolved as she brought a hand<br>
<br>
down and gently brushed his cheek.<br>
<br>
"What would you do if I did something really rude while I was down here?" he muttered<br>
<br>
in a brusque voice, making his final attempt to put up a fight.<br>
<br>
He heard a quiet laugh.<br>
<br>
"I guess I would stand right up and then stomp on you."<br>
<br>
"Sorry I asked."<br>
<br>
Recently, Mahiru had been a bit more reserved, so hearing her tease him after so long<br>
<br>
was almost nostalgic. Amane apologized right away, in case the threat was serious, but<br>
<br>
Mahiru was smiling in amusement at Amane's reaction.<br>
<br>
"Well, I know you wouldn't do anything like that. You don't seem to have the courage<br>
<br>
or the energy."<br>
<br>
He had some complicated feelings about being called a coward so casually, but the truth<br>
<br>
was that he did not, in fact, have the nerve to try anything because he thought Mahiru<br>
<br>
would hate him if he did, so she wasn't exactly wrong.<br>
<br>
"Well, why don't you just relax instead? It'll be easier to reach you if you settle down."<br>
<br>
Amane didn't have much reason to refuse as she gently ran her white fingers through<br>
<br>
his black hair, so he kept his mouth shut.<br>
<br>
…She must be worried about me.<br>
<br>
This was probably Mahiru's way of cheering him up.<br>
<br>
Amane guessed that she realized he was feeling stressed lately and decided to help<br>
<br>
him decompress. He wasn't sure why her first thought was that it would be relaxing<br>
<br>
for him to lie down on her lap like this, but it was actually surprisingly comfortable, so<br>
<br>
he wasn't going to complain. And his heart wasn't pounding as hard as he'd expected,<br>
<br>
possibly because he was so worn out.<br>
<br>
A pleasant drowsiness washed over him. He had no idea it could feel so nice to have<br>
<br>
someone gently comb their fingers through his hair. It had been a long time since he<br>
<br>
had been spoiled by someone like this, and he wasn't sure what, if anything, he should<br>
<br>
do. He could feel himself sinking gradually into a deep sea of happiness and<br>
<br>
contentment. It probably wouldn't be long before he was on the cusp of sleep.<br>
<br>
Just as soft slumber was about to completely overtake him, Amane heard Mahiru say,<br>
<br>
"Well, doesn't the young gentleman have a single thing to say about what it's like to lay<br>
<br>
his head in a young lady's lap?"<br>
<br>
His eyes snapped open as he exhaled sharply.<br>
<br>
"Ah, well, see—"<br>
<br>
"I heard from Chitose that when a boy is tired, if you let him lie down on your lap, it's<br>
<br>
like a dream come true and should help him feel better."<br>
<br>
Amane now realized he had Chitose's meddling to thank for this unusual bit of intimacy.<br>
<br>
Though, he couldn't honestly say she'd been completely off the mark. Actually, he<br>
<br>
really ought to thank her.<br>
<br>
Amane pursed his lips as he thought about how he should answer Mahiru's question.<br>
<br>
While he ruminated, she kept tapping his cheek with her finger.<br>
<br>
Frankly, it was the greatest feeling ever, and he wished he could enjoy it every day. But<br>
<br>
he was worried if he said that, she would be disgusted or taken aback, so he didn't say<br>
<br>
anything at all.<br>
<br>
He couldn't be completely honest, but on the other hand, he had to say something nice.<br>
<br>
He was being pampered here, so he couldn't lie and claim it wasn't all that special.<br>
<br>
However, he could practically envision himself saying something dumb and blunt that<br>
<br>
would drive her away.<br>
<br>
After puzzling over it for a few moments, Amane decided to respond with some mild<br>
<br>
praise.<br>
<br>
"…I think it's really great. But don't take that to mean anything weird." 1<br>
<br>
"How can I when it's the first time I've done it?"<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't keep his heart from leaping at the words first time. He remembered<br>
<br>
that she didn't like getting too close to boys and really avoided most physical contact<br>
<br>
altogether. Of course he would be the first.<br>
<br>
When he realized how much Mahiru must trust him to let him get so close, Amane felt<br>
<br>
his chest and face grow hot. But Mahiru didn't seem to notice and simply kept running<br>
<br>
her fingers through his hair with an air of satisfaction.<br>
<br>
"Well, it's something I wanted to try, so you just sit back and relax. I'm only petting you<br>
<br>
anyway."<br>
<br>
"…I guess."<br>
<br>
Mahiru emphasized that she was just doing as she pleased, so he didn't need to hold<br>
<br>
back or be anxious. Feeling a bit sheepish about it all, Amane decided to take Mahiru<br>
<br>
up on her offer.<br>
<br>
"…Amane, what do you think of our class this year?"<br>
<br>
She had played with his hair in silence for a little while before casually posing the<br>
<br>
question.<br>
<br>
"Hmm, well, I never thought we'd end up in the same class."<br>
<br>
He'd been hoping to have at least one friend in his class, but it hadn't occurred to him<br>
<br>
that everyone could end up together.<br>
<br>
"Heh-heh. It was fun to see you so stunned."<br>
<br>
"Hey… But yeah, it definitely caught me by surprise. I'll have to be vigilant."<br>
<br>
"What do you mean?"<br>
<br>
"I'll need to keep my distance so I don't speak to you too casually or act overly familiar."<br>
<br>
On the one hand, Amane felt relieved that his friends would be nearby, but on the other<br>
<br>
hand, since Mahiru was there, he would have to be careful about how they interacted.<br>
<br>
He would avoid talking to her whenever he could, but if he slipped up and let on that<br>
<br>
they were close, it would probably become a huge spectacle.<br>
<br>
In spite of his feelings, he didn't want to be indiscreet about his relationship with<br>
<br>
Mahiru at school. As far as Amane was concerned, as long as they could spend time<br>
<br>
together at home, that was fine by him. He had no desire to go out of his way to make<br>
<br>
enemies out of most of the boys at school.<br>
<br>
As long as people didn't know about their relationship, they wouldn't try to talk to<br>
<br>
him. He planned on acting like the two of them were strangers. Thinking that surely<br>
<br>
Mahiru must understand, he let his eyes close—but she pinched his cheek between<br>
<br>
her fingers.<br>
<br>
"…What's wrong?"<br>
<br>
"…Oh, nothing. I understand your logic, but I couldn't let it slide without doing anything,<br>
<br>
so…"<br>
<br>
"What's that supposed to mean…?"<br>
<br>
She seemed very sulky for some reason, but there was nothing Amane could do. He<br>
<br>
surmised that she wanted the two of them to talk like they always did, even at school.<br>
<br>
After all, she could relax around him. But she wasn't the one who'd end up in trouble.<br>
<br>
If Amane had been a popular and attractive guy—like Itsuki, for example—then maybe<br>
<br>
the two of them could hang out whenever and wherever they wanted. But since Amane<br>
<br>
was not popular or even sociable, it was a different story entirely.<br>
<br>
It wasn't hard to imagine that there might be people who would decide that Amane<br>
<br>
wasn't worthy of the angel's attention and hound him.<br>
<br>
Amane was accustomed to being alone. What he didn't need was the ire of his classmates.<br>
<br>
"…Well, I'll go along with it… for now," Mahiru said eventually.<br>
<br>
"I dunno how I feel about that 'for now'…but it's a start."<br>
<br>
"We'll still act normal at home, though, right?"<br>
<br>
"Of course… But if we're going to act normal, shouldn't I get out of your lap?"<br>
<br>
"This doesn't count."<br>
<br>
Mahiru announced this strange exception and brushed Amane's hair again. Or rather,<br>
<br>
she played with it like she was kneading it. Amane knew that if he said anything more,<br>
<br>
Mahiru would pout again, and as long as he kept his mouth shut, he could keep savoring<br>
<br>
this blissful moment. It was an easy decision.<br>
<br>
Maybe because she was pleased by Amane's silent and docile reception, Mahiru<br>
<br>
started arranging his hair more deliberately.<br>
<br>
Her movements were gentle and affectionate, as well as a little awkward, but Amane<br>
<br>
submitted to the comforting sensation, and it wasn't long before he was utterly at her<br>
<br>
mercy.<br>
<br>
…I'm really being spoiled…<br>
<br>
If she kept this up, he would without a doubt sink into the deepest of slumbers. He felt<br>
<br>
his eyes start to drift closed again as he basked in Mahiru's warmth, and another wave<br>
<br>
of sleepiness washed over him. Truly, there was no defying the lulling power of the<br>
<br>
angel's lap. 1<br>
<br>
He resisted the urge to roll over toward her and burrow into the inviting warmth and<br>
<br>
surround himself with her smell. He knew that if he did that, there would be no turning<br>
<br>
back, so he deliberately kept his back to her, just barely holding his ground.<br>
<br>
As Mahiru continued stroking his head affectionately, he began to feel heavy, and after<br>
<br>
another moment of resistance, he finally surrendered to the irresistible comfort.<br>
<br>
"…You look sleepy."<br>
<br>
He heard her quiet murmur but no longer had the energy to lift his eyelids.<br>
<br>
"It's all right; I'll wake you up in a bit. Go ahead and rest."<br>
<br>
As he listened to her soft whispers, Amane could no longer stay awake and quickly<br>
<br>
yielded to the embrace of the sandman.<br>
<br>
When he lifted his heavy eyelids, Amane was looking up at two mountains covered by<br>
<br>
a blouse, and beyond that, Mahiru's face, wearing a tender expression. He immediately<br>
<br>
sat up, eyes wide with surprise.<br>
<br>
Apparently, he had turned over at some point in his sleep to face the ceiling. Because<br>
<br>
of that, he had been greeted with a rather bracing view upon waking, and his heart<br>
<br>
was thumping strangely.<br>
<br>
"…How long was I out for?"<br>
<br>
At this question, Mahiru let slip a faint smile.<br>
<br>
"About an hour. You look so cute when you're sleeping."<br>
<br>
"Don't stare at me, geez."<br>
<br>
"You're one to talk."<br>
<br>
He had attempted to rebuke Mahiru for her teasing, but she immediately turned the<br>
<br>
tables on him. It was true, he had watched Mahiru sleep several times before—and<br>
<br>
had gone as far as to touch her face once—so he really didn't have much room to<br>
<br>
complain.<br>
<br>
"I let you see me with my guard down, so I thought it was time to even the score."<br>
<br>
"But you fell asleep all on your own… so… mghnhgh…"<br>
<br>
"Oh, so you're talking back to me now?"<br>
<br>
She gently pinched both his cheeks.<br>
<br>
"Showwy…," Amane meekly apologized, still struggling to talk properly.<br>
<br>
"Very well. Good grief."<br>
<br>
Apparently satisfied with Amane's apology, Mahiru stopped tugging at his cheeks and<br>
<br>
started poking at them instead. In the end, it didn't change the fact that she was<br>
<br>
touching his face, but Amane had also pinched her, so this was his just deserts.<br>
<br>
His cheeks were less pliable and stretchy than Mahiru's, so he didn't see how pinching<br>
<br>
them could be all that much fun. Still, Mahiru kept it up with a happy smile, slowing<br>
<br>
tracing a finger down his cheek.<br>
<br>
"You look much better now."<br>
<br>
"Did I really look that worn out earlier?"<br>
<br>
"Not exactly. But I see you every day, so I can tell. I mean, you notice whenever I'm<br>
<br>
having a hard time, right, Amane?"<br>
<br>
"Guess that's true."<br>
<br>
"It's that sort of thing."<br>
<br>
Mahiru made this declaration with a blank expression, then traced over Amane's<br>
<br>
cheek again and smiled impishly.<br>
<br>
"Whenever things get tough, I want you to lean on me, okay? Just like you let me lean<br>
<br>
on you."<br>
<br>
"…I'll try."<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Mahiru pinched him again, gripping his cheeks between her thumbs and<br>
<br>
two fingers.<br>
<br>
Hoping to save his poor face from further pinch-related damage, he replied in a panic,<br>
<br>
"F-fine, I understand!"<br>
<br>
Mahiru nodded in satisfaction. "Good."<br>
<br>
"…This is coercion, you know."<br>
<br>
"Women can be forceful when we need to be. Besides, I never let anyone other than<br>
<br>
you see me behave this way, so there's no problem, really."<br>
<br>
"Uh, there's plenty of problems."<br>
<br>
If anything, that's scarier.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had also just admitted that she gave Amane special treatment. But she didn't<br>
<br>
seem particularly concerned about the implications of what she just said and simply<br>
<br>
smiled when she saw Amane's obvious embarrassment.<br>
<br>
"You dummy," Amane muttered, turning away in a weak attempt to hide his chagrin.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 28: Contact with the Prince<br>
<br>
Even though he and Mahiru now had class together, Amane's daily life had hardly<br>
<br>
changed at all. He diligently attended school like a good student, ate lunch with Itsuki<br>
<br>
in the cafeteria, and went home afterward because he wasn't in a club. He almost never<br>
<br>
interacted with Mahiru. Everything was as it should be.<br>
<br>
One thing that had changed a little bit was that he'd started talking with Yuuta more<br>
<br>
than during their first year.<br>
<br>
That said, it wasn't Amane's idea. Rather, Yuuta often approached him, and Amane did<br>
<br>
his best to handle the attention despite his obvious confusion.<br>
<br>
The day of the opening ceremony, he had felt for an instant that the events of the past<br>
<br>
might be repeating, and that had naturally set him on edge. But Yuuta was clearly a<br>
<br>
different kind of person than his former friend.<br>
<br>
Amane was still slightly on guard, but that didn't mean he wanted to awkwardly keep<br>
<br>
Yuuta at arm's length, and as they spent time together, Amane began to recognize that<br>
<br>
Yuuta was a cheerful, honest, and compassionate young man. Above all, he had Itsuki's<br>
<br>
seal of approval, so Amane didn't think he was someone who demanded his suspicion.<br>
<br>
After attending his first week of school as a second-year high school student, Amane<br>
<br>
noticed that the pain he had been harboring for so long began to fade.<br>
<br>
"Hey, are you cool with this?"<br>
<br>
Sitting across from Amane, Itsuki said that as if he had suddenly remembered to ask.<br>
<br>
At the moment, they were having lunch in the cafeteria just like they had done since<br>
<br>
their first year.<br>
<br>
Sometimes Chitose would join them, but today she was off eating with Mahiru. Amane<br>
<br>
was glad the two of them got along, even in public.<br>
<br>
"Cool with what?"<br>
<br>
"I mean: keeping things as they are with you know who."<br>
<br>
"There's no need to go out of my way to talk to her at school."<br>
<br>
By which I mean, if I speak to her, everyone around us is going to stare and wonder where<br>
<br>
I got the nerve.<br>
<br>
It wouldn't do for meek, unfashionable Amane to be seen approaching Mahiru.<br>
<br>
"Dude, she's just itching to talk to you, and it shows."<br>
<br>
"…Yeah, I noticed."<br>
<br>
Mahiru seemed to be doing her best to ignore Amane, but every now and then she<br>
<br>
would slip up and stare over at him glumly.<br>
<br>
So far, she'd only done it when nobody else was looking, but Chitose had taken it upon<br>
<br>
herself to start giving Amane dirty looks on Mahiru's behalf, so it was becoming harder<br>
<br>
and harder to endure.<br>
<br>
"You need to transform. There's no other way."<br>
<br>
"No way; dressing up like that is a huge pain, and you know I don't like the attention."<br>
<br>
Besides, even if the rumors had settled down for the moment, some people had seen<br>
<br>
him out and about with Mahiru, even if they hadn't recognized him. If people made the<br>
<br>
connection that Amane was the mystery man, things would probably get so hectic it<br>
<br>
would derail his whole high school career.<br>
<br>
"Why are you like this…? And honestly, you could be so popular." 1<br>
<br>
"That makes no sense."<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't imagine changing his hair a little bit and suddenly becoming popular,<br>
<br>
but Itsuki seemed convinced for some reason.<br>
<br>
"I think you've got the kind of personality that girls want in a boyfriend. You've got a<br>
<br>
cynical side, but you're also sincere, and you're the type of guy who treats girls well."<br>
<br>
"…Isn't that normal?"<br>
<br>
"I think there are a lot of guys who can't even do that much. Like, you're the type who<br>
<br>
can figure out what a girl wants and then make it happen. You don't make a big deal<br>
<br>
out of it; you just pay attention and then act on what you see."<br>
<br>
"…You sound awfully sure about this."<br>
<br>
"If you weren't that type of guy, do you really think that a cautious girl who's always<br>
<br>
hiding behind a guarded smile would have ever gotten attached to you?"<br>
<br>
When he put it that way, Amane couldn't refute his friend's theory.<br>
<br>
He bit his lip hard as he mulled it over, and Itsuki laughed.<br>
<br>
"…Also, can I say one thing?" his friend continued.<br>
<br>
"What?"<br>
<br>
"If you weren't into her, you probably wouldn't treat her as well as you do."<br>
<br>
"Shut up. Is it so bad being nice to someone?"<br>
<br>
Itsuki could read him like a book. There was no hiding how he felt. Amane turned away<br>
<br>
and began sulkily slurping up the noodles he'd ordered for lunch.<br>
<br>
Rather than teasing him further, Itsuki nodded sagely and acted impressed.<br>
<br>
"If you ask me, you oughtta be happy. It's a wonderful thing to find someone to treasure."<br>
<br>
"Oh, you think you're an expert?"<br>
<br>
"I know I am."<br>
<br>
"…I don't really care whether we get together. If there's someone out there who would<br>
<br>
make her happy, I don't mind if it's not me."<br>
<br>
If Mahiru chose some other, unknown man and was really, truly happy with him, Amane<br>
<br>
would give them his blessing. If anyone deserved happiness, it was Mahiru. Of course,<br>
<br>
he very much wanted to be the one to make her happy, but if she ended up finding<br>
<br>
fulfillment elsewhere, he wouldn't balk at swallowing his feelings.<br>
<br>
"…You're such a wuss."<br>
<br>
"And you're a jackass… Look, I do want to make her happy, I do, but—"<br>
<br>
"Then just tell her that already."<br>
<br>
"I can't just come out and say it, you moron!"<br>
<br>
How can I confess my feelings if I haven't even figured them out myself?<br>
<br>
Mahiru was so cautious when it came to relationships that Amane was sure there was<br>
<br>
no way she would be willing to go out with someone for fun or just to try things out.<br>
<br>
It was all or nothing.<br>
<br>
And given everything with Mahiru's parents, she's not likely to agree to date so easily<br>
<br>
anyway.<br>
<br>
"…You are a serious late bloomer."<br>
<br>
"Shut up. It's fine; I can get her to like me in my own way."<br>
<br>
"…Well, as an objective observer, I think it'd be better if you tell her everything straight<br>
<br>
up, but—"<br>
<br>
"But what?"<br>
<br>
"…Nothing," Itsuki muttered. "…All right; good luck. I'm rooting for you."<br>
<br>
Amane frowned, but he was actually really grateful for his friend's somewhatexasperated encouragement.<br>
<br>
"Oh, Fujimiya, don't see you here often."<br>
<br>
Amane had stopped by the local arcade after school. He was just inserting a bill into<br>
<br>
the change machine when he heard a familiar voice.<br>
<br>
He stuffed his change into his wallet and turned around to find Yuuta standing there.<br>
<br>
He had apparently also come to play games and was standing behind Amane with his<br>
<br>
wallet in one hand.<br>
<br>
"Kadowaki? You're an even rarer sight. What happened to track club?"<br>
<br>
"We have a break today. It's not good to work the body too hard day after day."<br>
<br>
"Ah."<br>
<br>
So the school's top track-and-field star takes a vacation once in a while, too, eh?<br>
<br>
Amane stepped back from the machine, and Yuuta inserted his bills and waited for the<br>
<br>
change. Once he'd deposited about two thousand yen worth of coins back in his wallet,<br>
<br>
Yuuta noticed Amane staring at him and smiled.<br>
<br>
"I'm surprised to find you in a place like this, Fujimiya. You don't seem like you would<br>
<br>
appreciate the noise much."<br>
<br>
"I hit up game centers like everyone else. I just don't like to waste money, so I don't go<br>
<br>
that often."<br>
<br>
"Hmm. Well, what did you come for today?"<br>
<br>
"I wanted to check out the crane games. I got an order to pick up a stuffed animal."<br>
<br>
Actually, it was more like Chitose had shown him the NEW ARRIVALS page of the game<br>
<br>
center's website and pointed out which ones Mahiru might like, so he had decided to<br>
<br>
get one as a present for Mahiru, since she had seemed a little down lately.<br>
<br>
Also, as he had seen in the infamous photo Chitose had sent him, Mahiru's apartment<br>
<br>
was quite sparse. So he was hoping to win a cute friend for the teddy bear he'd already<br>
<br>
gotten her.<br>
<br>
"Do you think you can win a stuffed animal?"<br>
<br>
"It's kind of my specialty."<br>
<br>
The crane arms at this particular arcade were stronger than usual, so it was easy to<br>
<br>
pick up the toys. As long as he accounted for the balance and position of the stuffed<br>
<br>
animals when controlling the crane, it was surprisingly easy to snag a prize.<br>
<br>
It was actually his mother who had taught him how, way back in elementary school.<br>
<br>
"This one, you see? If you bring the arm down right here, you can get it no problem. And<br>
<br>
this one is good, too. Just hook the tag with the arm."It was one of many pointless talents<br>
<br>
that had rubbed off on him.<br>
<br>
Yuuta was giving him an incredulous look, so Amane led his classmate over to the<br>
<br>
corner crammed with all the crane games. He decided to try his luck on a machine in<br>
<br>
the new-arrivals section filled with stuffed rabbits.<br>
<br>
Amane casually put a coin in the slot. Judging by the placement of the stuffed animals<br>
<br>
and the size of the crane arm, a single coin would be enough. Some prizes took a lot of<br>
<br>
money to win, but one of these stuffed rabbits—a character Amane didn't recognize—<br>
<br>
should be easy.<br>
<br>
He aimed the crane at the place where the rabbit's head and body met and skillfully<br>
<br>
guided the arm into place, catching the head and avoiding the body. As the crane came<br>
<br>
back up, it brought the prize with it, secured by the head. When he took his hand off<br>
<br>
the lever, the stuffed rabbit tumbled down the prize shoot with a plop.<br>
<br>
Amane casually pulled it out and turned to show Yuuta, who looked impressed.<br>
<br>
"Wow!"<br>
<br>
"The crane arms at this game center are strong, and the staff are friendly, so if you get<br>
<br>
stuck, they'll show you how to win. It's a good place for beginners, too."<br>
<br>
"So that's why Itsuki and the others said this place would be good? I see now." Yuuta<br>
<br>
nodded. "By the way, is that a gift for someone in particular?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah. Someone who takes good care of me. I want to show my appreciation."<br>
<br>
Well, it's not a lie.<br>
<br>
I just conveniently left out the fact that I'm talking about Mahiru. It's true she takes care<br>
<br>
of me, and I am grateful for what she does every day.<br>
<br>
He also quite simply thought Mahiru would look adorable surrounded by stuffed<br>
<br>
animals, so his choice of gift was not entirely innocent.<br>
<br>
"You're a really thoughtful guy, Fujimiya. But I knew that already."<br>
<br>
"What do you mean, you knew that?"<br>
<br>
"Well, you're sensitive, and you always act like a gentleman. Plus, you help people out<br>
<br>
without making a big deal of it."<br>
<br>
"Sometimes, I guess."<br>
<br>
"Even if it's only sometimes, you helped me. Like with the bags and stuff, that was a<br>
<br>
big help." Yuuta thanked him again with a bright smile, and Amane felt slightly<br>
<br>
embarrassed.<br>
<br>
It really wasn't a big deal, but apparently Yuuta still remembered it.<br>
<br>
Amane usually had shopping bags on hand anyway, and it hadn't been his intention to<br>
<br>
make Yuuta feel indebted to him.<br>
<br>
"…Oh yeah, did you eat all that Valentine's chocolate, Kadowaki?" Amane asked, trying<br>
<br>
to move past the awkwardness he felt when confronted with Yuuta's overflowing<br>
<br>
gratitude.<br>
<br>
Yuuta's expression grew cloudy. "Ah… Can you keep a secret? I only ate the storebought ones."<br>
<br>
"You didn't eat the handmade ones?"<br>
<br>
"…The handmade chocolates are… How do I put this? I'm sure there are some girls<br>
<br>
who can make them well, but—"<br>
<br>
"They're bad?"<br>
<br>
"No, it's just… Sometimes they have hairs in them or other things that clearly shouldn't<br>
<br>
be in there."<br>
<br>
"Are we still talking about chocolate…?"<br>
<br>
Finding out that something like that had accidentally gotten mixed in would have been<br>
<br>
bad enough, but from hearing his voice, Amane suspected that Yuuta had discovered<br>
<br>
intentional adulterations on more than one occasion.<br>
<br>
He remembered reading somewhere that, long ago, people had believed mixing a part<br>
<br>
of the body into someone's food could work like a magic charm to make them fall in<br>
<br>
love. The person who consumed the secret ingredient was supposed to be helpless to<br>
<br>
resist the effects.<br>
<br>
"I accept the gifts, even if they've got… stuff in them, but… that used to happen a lot,<br>
<br>
and I'm still afraid it might happen again, so I tell everyone ahead of time that I won't<br>
<br>
eat any handmade chocolates. The ones who give them to me anyway… Well, I appreciate<br>
<br>
the thought behind the present, and I do still pay back every gift. Unfortunately, some<br>
<br>
of them try to disguise it as store-bought chocolate, but… What can you do? And of<br>
<br>
course, if it happens more than once, I never accept chocolate from that girl again,<br>
<br>
so…" Yuuta trailed off, looking sad and lost. Amane couldn't help but feel bad for him.<br>
<br>
"…I guess even popular guys have it rough."<br>
<br>
"Meanwhile, everybody is so jealous of me, I feel like I can't complain, but… It's not<br>
<br>
like I want to be popular. Honestly, it's miserable. I'd give it all up if I could."<br>
<br>
"Sounds serious." Amane nodded.<br>
<br>
"I mean, yeah, it's disturbing. Girls give me sweets or food with weird stuff hidden in<br>
<br>
it, smiling the whole time."<br>
<br>
It was only reasonable to be apprehensive.<br>
<br>
Ordinarily, most boys would treasure a girl's handmade food, but for Yuuta it was a<br>
<br>
potential threat. Going through something so awful so many times must have been<br>
<br>
terrible.<br>
<br>
"Sometimes I think it would be easier if I went out with someone, so the other girls<br>
<br>
would stop flirting with me… but I'm afraid whoever I picked would end up getting<br>
<br>
bullied."<br>
<br>
"…Jealousy's a scary thing."<br>
<br>
"Yeah…"<br>
<br>
Yuuta's shoulders slumped like he was at a complete loss. He seemed exhausted.<br>
<br>
Amane won a large bag of potato sticks from a nearby machine and offered them to<br>
<br>
the sad boy in front of him.<br>
<br>
"Eat these; you'll feel better," he said. "And you know, if you ever want to talk or<br>
<br>
something, you can come to Itsuki or me."<br>
<br>
"It's just hard sometimes… So I appreciate it."<br>
<br>
Seeing Yuuta so troubled, it occurred to Amane that popularity didn't always make<br>
<br>
people's lives easier or better.<br>
<br>
When Amane got home, Mahiru heard him entering and came to the door to greet him.<br>
<br>
She was wearing her apron and had her hair up in a bun. She always tied it back when<br>
<br>
she was cooking, but this time she had added a braid as a cute flourish that accentuated<br>
<br>
her practical style.<br>
<br>
Mahiru smiled, a little relieved now that Amane had returned. Apparently, she had<br>
<br>
already finished making dinner.<br>
<br>
After leaving the arcade, Amane had gone to a cafe with Yuuta to listen to him complain<br>
<br>
over coffee. He had let Mahiru know he would be late, but evidently she had still<br>
<br>
worried.<br>
<br>
"Welcome home, Amane… What's in the bag?"<br>
<br>
"I stopped by the arcade and got some prizes."<br>
<br>
The huge bag was crammed full of all the things he'd won, including the stuffed rabbit.<br>
<br>
It was obvious just by looking that there was a lot inside.<br>
<br>
"…That's quite the haul."<br>
<br>
"And I only used about two days' worth of lunch money."<br>
<br>
"Wow, what did you win?"<br>
<br>
"Maybe we can save that for later? I'm starving."<br>
<br>
Amane wanted to find the right moment to present her with the rabbit. Her surprise<br>
<br>
would be worth the wait.<br>
<br>
Besides, his stomach was growling. He wasn't lying when he said he wanted to enjoy<br>
<br>
some of Mahiru's delicious cooking.<br>
<br>
"In that case, go change and wash your hands—and don't forget to gargle. While you<br>
<br>
do, I'll set the table."<br>
<br>
"Roger, roger." 1<br>
<br>
He didn't really need the reminders, but it still made him happy to hear her concern<br>
<br>
for him. She was maybe even acting a little maternal, but he didn't say that out loud<br>
<br>
and instead headed to the bathroom as instructed.<br>
<br>
"…So what did you bring back that needed such a large bag?"<br>
<br>
The prizes must have been on Mahiru's mind. After dinner, she glanced over at the bag<br>
<br>
sitting beside the sofa and asked about it again.<br>
<br>
"Hmm? Stuffed animals."<br>
<br>
Amane had no intention of hiding it, so he picked up the bag and set it on his lap, then<br>
<br>
peeled off the tape keeping it closed.<br>
<br>
"Stuffed animals?"<br>
<br>
"You like them, right, Mahiru?"<br>
<br>
"Y-yeah, I do, but—"<br>
<br>
"I saw a few I thought you might like, so I got them for you. Here."<br>
<br>
The best prize among the day's winnings had to be the stuffed bunny that was about<br>
<br>
the same size as the bear he had given her before. It was pretty large, and he had won<br>
<br>
it with only a single coin, so he decided it was all right to feel a little proud.<br>
<br>
He pulled out the bunny and set it on Mahiru's knee, where she could get a good view<br>
<br>
of its white fur and big round eyes.<br>
<br>
He didn't really know anything about the particular mascot. He had simply picked it<br>
<br>
out because a bunny seemed like something Mahiru would like.<br>
<br>
She stared at the stuffed rabbit sitting on her knee.<br>
<br>
"You… don't like rabbits?"<br>
<br>
"…It's cute."<br>
<br>
"I'm glad."<br>
<br>
Mahiru wrapped both arms around the stuffed rabbit and squeezed it tight against her<br>
<br>
cheek, just like she always did with her favorite cushion. For a second, Amane thought<br>
<br>
about getting out his phone for a picture but ultimately decided against it.<br>
<br>
She was smiling softly, so he captured the scene with his mental camera and pulled<br>
<br>
another stuffed animal from the densely packed bag.<br>
<br>
"There's more. I've got cats and dogs and—"<br>
<br>
Thanks to the crane arms at that game center being relatively strong, Amane had been<br>
<br>
able to get most of the prizes for very little money, so he had picked up toy after toy,<br>
<br>
grabbing any and all he thought Mahiru would like.<br>
<br>
As he added a beige-and-white stuffed cat that looked sort of like Mahiru's style and a<br>
<br>
plush Shiba Inu dog, she looked at him with bewilderment.<br>
<br>
"Uh, um, this many…?"<br>
<br>
"I… Uh, I hope they won't be in the way…"<br>
<br>
"No, not at all! I don't have any decorations in my apartment, and they're very cute.<br>
<br>
I'm happy."<br>
<br>
"That's great."<br>
<br>
As he had imagined, Mahiru looked adorable surrounded by a small herd of stuffed<br>
<br>
animals.<br>
<br>
She was still hugging the bunny, but she looked back and forth restlessly between the<br>
<br>
cat and dog, wondering which to hug next. Amane couldn't help but smile, and Mahiru<br>
<br>
must have noticed him watching her, because her face turned bright red, and she tried<br>
<br>
to hide behind the stuffed rabbit.<br>
<br>
The contrast between the rabbit's white fur and her blushing cheeks was striking.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's eyes, peeking out from the gap between the bunny's ears, were a bit teary,<br>
<br>
which only made her more adorable. Finally, overcome by embarrassment, she leaned<br>
<br>
over and buried her face in Amane's shoulder.<br>
<br>
"…Don't grin at me like that."<br>
<br>
"I wasn't."<br>
<br>
"You were! You were smiling. Laughing at me for being childish."<br>
<br>
"That's not why I was smiling. It's because you're cute."<br>
<br>
"…So you were smiling after all, weren't you?"<br>
<br>
"You got me," he said teasingly, flashing her another big grin. This time, Mahiru slapped<br>
<br>
his thigh, so he rubbed her head in an attempt to pacify her for the time being.<br>
<br>
Mahiru seemed to settle down, and when he grinned at her again, he did his best to<br>
<br>
make sure she didn't notice.<br>
<br>
"…I feel like this is all a trick or something."<br>
<br>
"It's only your imagination."<br>
<br>
"…Well, just for today, I'll play along," Mahiru muttered disapprovingly. Amane decided<br>
<br>
not to point out that she was still smiling.<br>
<br>
Looking at the cat that was in Mahiru's lap and the bunny she was holding, he thought<br>
<br>
she reminded him a little of both of those animals as he continued stroking her hair.<br>
<br>
Mahiru suddenly sat up. Her cheeks were still flushed, but Amane could see a new<br>
<br>
tinge of protest in her eyes.<br>
<br>
"…I'm always on the receiving end."<br>
<br>
Apparently, all the gifts were making her uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
"I'm just doing what I want to do, so don't worry about it."<br>
<br>
"But… I'm always getting things from you. You give me presents, and you're so<br>
<br>
thoughtful, and you spend so much time with me… Everything."<br>
<br>
"But those are all things I want to give you, so there's nothing for you to worry about."<br>
<br>
It's not like I'm expecting to be paid back or anything. It's just because I want to make her<br>
<br>
happy. Maybe that makes it sound like her happiness is my compensation or something,<br>
<br>
but the truth is it's all for my own satisfaction. It feels good to make her happy, so I do.<br>
<br>
That's all there is to it.<br>
<br>
But apparently Mahiru felt guilty. That seemed absurd to Amane, considering all the<br>
<br>
trouble she went to for his sake, plus all the care and attention she always gave him.<br>
<br>
He honestly didn't think he was anywhere close to balancing the scales.<br>
<br>
But it seemed Mahiru felt the opposite.<br>
<br>
"I want to give something back," she insisted.<br>
<br>
"You're so stubborn…," he teased. "But… I guess if you feel that strongly, there is maybe<br>
<br>
one thing I'd like."<br>
<br>
"If it's something I can give, name it."<br>
<br>
She really seemed like she was ready to do whatever he asked. Of course, he wasn't<br>
<br>
going to put her on the spot with anything crazy. But he had to make a request of some<br>
<br>
kind, or Mahiru would feel even worse.<br>
<br>
"I want a pudding."<br>
<br>
And so Amane gladly asked for something he knew Mahiru could handle.<br>
<br>
"…A pudding?"<br>
<br>
"One with plenty of eggs. I want to eat your homemade version."<br>
<br>
"…You don't mean one from the store, right? That's not nearly enough to pay you back."<br>
<br>
"Of course not. I'll only be satisfied if you make it yourself."<br>
<br>
Amane didn't care for most sweets, but pudding was a different matter.<br>
<br>
He liked cream puffs that were made with only pudding or custard-cream filling and<br>
<br>
knew that if Mahiru made the pudding by hand, it was sure to be delicious. A sweet<br>
<br>
treat skillfully handcrafted by a girl he liked… He couldn't think of anything better.<br>
<br>
He made his request very seriously, and Mahiru stared up at him silently for a moment,<br>
<br>
then nodded sharply.<br>
<br>
"…All right, I'll make some this weekend. A stiff pudding with lots of egg, right?"<br>
<br>
"Mm-hmm."<br>
<br>
"I'll do my best to make something tasty!"<br>
<br>
"Okay, okay, you don't have to get so worked up…"<br>
<br>
"If I'm doing it, I'm going to do it right."<br>
<br>
"Is that how it is?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru seemed to be taking this very seriously for some reason. Amane thought that<br>
<br>
maybe she didn't need to try so hard, but since he was going to get a delicious pudding<br>
<br>
out of it, he couldn't complain.<br>
<br>
He stroked her head once more to show his support, and Mahiru looked slightly<br>
<br>
bashful and buried the lower part of her face in the back of the bunny's head.<br>
<br>
Soft puddings with an abundance of heavy cream were delicious, of course, but for<br>
<br>
Amane, the best pudding was a stiff one with plenty of egg, the kind that held its shape<br>
<br>
even in the spoon.<br>
<br>
The pudding that Mahiru made clearly highlighted the taste of the egg yolks while<br>
<br>
carefully balancing the richness of the heavy cream. It had a clean, distinct flavor, and<br>
<br>
the touch of the caramel's burnt-sugar bitterness kept the whole thing from being too<br>
<br>
sweet.<br>
<br>
Amane found himself bringing spoonful after spoonful to his mouth as if in a trance.<br>
<br>
Before he knew it, Mahiru's pudding had completely disappeared from his dish.<br>
<br>
"Man, that was insanely good."<br>
<br>
"I'm really flattered to hear that."<br>
<br>
She had brought out the pudding after dinner, and Amane had made short work of it.<br>
<br>
One serving hadn't been enough, so he'd asked for seconds.<br>
<br>
For a high school boy, Amane didn't have that big of an appetite, but when it came to<br>
<br>
Mahiru's homemade desserts, he was not surprised to find that he always had room.<br>
<br>
Feeling even more satisfied than expected for how much he ate, Amane felt utterly<br>
<br>
content. He rubbed his bulging belly.<br>
<br>
"You really can make anything, huh?"<br>
<br>
"Well, I had a very… demanding education," Mahiru replied. She was not boasting in<br>
<br>
the slightest, but it was true that her culinary repertoire was impressive. Sometimes<br>
<br>
she even made dishes Amane had never seen before. They were always good, and he<br>
<br>
couldn't get enough of her cooking. Having someone like Mahiru around to make him<br>
<br>
delicious food was one of Amane's greatest joys.<br>
<br>
"Well, I don't know what else to say, except thank you. I'm very happy."<br>
<br>
"…Happy?"<br>
<br>
"Sure. I mean, who could be unsatisfied with life when they get to eat tasty stuff like<br>
<br>
this day after day? I always look forward to it."<br>
<br>
Mahiru's cooking was pretty much what he looked forward to the most every day. As<br>
<br>
long as he got to enjoy a meal with her at the end of the day, he could forget all his<br>
<br>
woes and troubles.<br>
<br>
Just the very fact that she was cooking for him all the time was cause for joy, and he<br>
<br>
was flooded with feelings of happiness every time he took a bite, but Mahiru didn't<br>
<br>
really seem to understand the value of her own dishes.<br>
<br>
Once before, Amane had said that Mahiru's cooking tasted like happiness, but Mahiru<br>
<br>
didn't seem to understand. If Amane didn't heap high praise on her, she might never<br>
<br>
recognize its value.<br>
<br>
Besides, it was good manners to compliment the cook when their dishes were<br>
<br>
phenomenal, and he intended to follow through on that.<br>
<br>
"…Y-you really think so?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru's cheeks flushed slightly at his praise, and she shrunk into herself a little.<br>
<br>
"…It makes me happy when you say things like that, Amane."<br>
<br>
"Well, if you don't mind that they're coming from me, I'll give you as many compliments<br>
<br>
as you like. Maybe you want me to be more specific, instead of just saying that<br>
<br>
everything is good? I can do that, no problem."<br>
<br>
Rifts between couples often start with forgetting to thank each other, after all.<br>
<br>
Not that he and Mahiru were a couple or anything. But she made dinner for him on an<br>
<br>
almost daily basis, and he believed it was important to express his gratitude often. And<br>
<br>
besides, getting good feedback probably made her feel more motivated, so if she<br>
<br>
wanted, he was prepared to present detailed notes.<br>
<br>
But Mahiru shook her head, directly rejecting that idea.<br>
<br>
"P-please don't… I'd die if you did."<br>
<br>
"That's a little extreme, isn't it?"<br>
<br>
"I'm being serious. What you do now is already perfect."<br>
<br>
"Really? But you're going to keep making food for me, so I want to show you my<br>
<br>
appreciation properly. Thank you for everything."<br>
<br>
Honestly, these days, Amane's diet entirely depended on Mahiru's cooking, so he felt<br>
<br>
like he owed her a lot and wanted to do what he could for her. She was so very<br>
<br>
important to him. When Mahiru wasn't around, Amane quickly fell back into his old<br>
<br>
hopeless habits, so he hoped she would stay by his side for a long time.<br>
<br>
He smiled gratefully, and Mahiru trembled like a phone on vibrate, then quickly stood<br>
<br>
up.<br>
<br>
"…Stupid Amane…" she said in a cute voice. Then she carried the dishes over to the<br>
<br>
sink. Amane followed, his own dishes in hand.<br>
<br>
She had moved suddenly, so Amane wanted to get her attention to tell her he'd handle<br>
<br>
the cleanup and that she didn't have to do anything else. The moment he lightly caught<br>
<br>
hold of Mahiru's arm, she whirled around to face him.<br>
<br>
She looked at him with a face much redder than it had been before. She seemed like<br>
<br>
she really couldn't stand being there a second longer.<br>
<br>
"…I… I'll do the cleanup. You can go hang out on the sofa. Okay?"<br>
<br>
He ruffled her hair once and chased her from the kitchen. Groaning softly, Mahiru<br>
<br>
rushed for the couch and sank into the cushions. Amane was caught off guard by her<br>
<br>
sudden lack of composure.<br>
<br>
As he washed the dishes, Amane couldn't get her bashful expression out of his mind.<br>
<br>
He switched the tap to cold water, hoping to cool his head off a little.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 29: The Angel and an Unwanted Imposition<br>
<br>
Their classmates often called Mahiru an angel. Based on how gentle and modest she<br>
<br>
was, her kind personality, the fact that she was accomplished in both academics and<br>
<br>
sports, plus her unparalleled beauty, angel did seem like the appropriate nickname for<br>
<br>
her. It was no surprise then that she was very popular.<br>
<br>
During her first year of high school, many boys in many classes had confessed their<br>
<br>
love for her, and she said that turning them all down was not a point of pride for her,<br>
<br>
but an annoyance. She did not appreciate strangers approaching her for dates.<br>
<br>
So as popular as Mahiru was, after about half a year of stubbornly refusing every suitor,<br>
<br>
she had finally dissuaded the student body. By the time she met Amane, though many<br>
<br>
boys were undoubtedly still interested in her, the spate of romantic confessions had<br>
<br>
more or less abated.<br>
<br>
But that also meant they had not ceased entirely, as Amane came to realize.<br>
<br>
"Please go out with me."<br>
<br>
It happened after school, when Mahiru had stopped by the library to return a book<br>
<br>
before heading home.<br>
<br>
The library room wasn't in building one, where their classroom was, but in building<br>
<br>
two, meaning she had to walk through a connecting corridor to get there.<br>
<br>
Building two was basically full of classrooms, and it was deserted after school let out,<br>
<br>
save for the occasional student heading for a club meeting. Accordingly, there was very<br>
<br>
little pedestrian traffic, and it was quiet, so the boy's request was perfectly audible.<br>
<br>
When Amane heard the voice coming from below him as he walked down the<br>
<br>
connecting corridor on the second floor, he tried to step lightly. He wasn't one to stick<br>
<br>
his nose in strangers' love affairs. Those were private matters, and he didn't have much<br>
<br>
interest in other peoples' romances anyway. So not wanting to eavesdrop, Amane tried<br>
<br>
to briskly move along without making any noise.<br>
<br>
"I'm so sorry, but I have to turn you down."<br>
<br>
However, after hearing a very familiar voice, his body immediately went rigid despite<br>
<br>
his best intentions. It was a gentle, soft voice that was usually very pleasant. But it had<br>
<br>
an unmistakable edge to it now.<br>
<br>
Even though he knew he shouldn't, Amane crept to a nearby window and peeked over<br>
<br>
the lip. There on the first floor were Mahiru and a male student who might have been<br>
<br>
a classmate. Luckily, neither of them seemed to have noticed him.<br>
<br>
The boy had his back to Amane, so his expression wasn't visible, but Mahiru was<br>
<br>
looking at her suitor calmly.<br>
<br>
The graceful face of the class's angel was contorted into a somewhat apologetic<br>
<br>
expression, showing she had no intention of accepting his offer.<br>
<br>
"Why—?"<br>
<br>
"I don't know you. I'm very sorry, but I cannot return your feelings."<br>
<br>
"We can get to know each other once we're going out—"<br>
<br>
"I think that dating is something people should do after they've already built a<br>
<br>
relationship of mutual trust and affection. I'm not interested in going out with someone<br>
<br>
on a whim—a shallow relationship like that would only do a disservice to everyone<br>
<br>
involved."<br>
<br>
Mahiru had never appreciated shows of affection from boys, especially boys she didn't<br>
<br>
really know. And considering her home environment, the thought of dating a stranger<br>
<br>
probably made her very uncomfortable. So she was obviously not going to easily agree<br>
<br>
to go out with anybody who bothered to ask her.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's voice was gentle, but her refusal was firm. There was nothing more to discuss,<br>
<br>
so she nodded once and turned to leave, but… the would-be suitor grabbed her hand.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's lovely voice came out in a small cry of distress. She turned around, frowning<br>
<br>
nervously. "Excuse me. This is not okay." It seemed like she found his grip on her hand<br>
<br>
painful.<br>
<br>
"Sorry, but I can't just give up."<br>
<br>
"I am not going to go out with you. Now please, let me go."<br>
<br>
Though she spoke more forcefully this time, and with an undeniably disapproving<br>
<br>
expression, Mahiru nevertheless maintained her angelic composure to the very end.<br>
<br>
Still, the boy pressed her once more as he continued tugging on her hand. Now Mahiru<br>
<br>
looked frightened, afraid of what the boy might do next.<br>
<br>
Amane decided he couldn't let this go on any longer. He frowned and leaned out the<br>
<br>
half-open window. "I don't think she appreciates you being so forward," he grumbled,<br>
<br>
loudly enough for the two of them to hear.<br>
<br>
The boy spun around frantically, and Mahiru took advantage of the distraction to slip<br>
<br>
out of his grasp and quickly put some distance between the two of them. She must<br>
<br>
have recognized Amane's voice, because she looked relieved at the sudden intrusion.<br>
<br>
Though she had mostly maintained an impassive expression, Amane could tell that<br>
<br>
Mahiru was disgusted and frightened by the boy's selfish actions.<br>
<br>
This must really bother her…<br>
<br>
Amane glared at her boorish suitor with a mixture of anger and disgust.<br>
<br>
Understandably, the other boy's expression stiffened, which Amane took as a sign of a<br>
<br>
guilty conscience.<br>
<br>
"Sorry, I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but… I just happened to be passing through and<br>
<br>
saw you two were having some kind of trouble; that's all. Plus, it sounded like Shiina<br>
<br>
was in pain." Amane gestured to Mahiru, who was rubbing her hand where the boy<br>
<br>
had grabbed her.<br>
<br>
"A-are you really hurt?" the boy asked, looking even more unwell.<br>
<br>
"…You were awfully rough when you grabbed me. And anyway, it's wrong to touch a<br>
<br>
girl without her permission." Mahiru had regained her composure. Rather than just<br>
<br>
angry, her voice was icy cold.<br>
<br>
"So she says." Amane nodded. "You should watch it."<br>
<br>
The male student bit his lip hard. "Sorry" was all he said before hurrying away.<br>
<br>
Relieved that the other boy had finally run off, Amane turned toward Mahiru. She<br>
<br>
smiled at him faintly, still defensively clutching her hand to her chest. Seeing that made<br>
<br>
his heart ache, and he almost wanted to reach out to her. But they were still in school,<br>
<br>
so Amane couldn't carelessly make contact.<br>
<br>
Mahiru must have understood that. She bowed sharply and turned to walk away.<br>
<br>
Somehow, she looked even more delicate than usual, but all Amane could do was<br>
<br>
anxiously watch her go.<br>
<br>
"Thanks for earlier."<br>
<br>
That was the first thing Mahiru said to Amane once they'd gotten home. She was<br>
<br>
wearing a troubled smile.<br>
<br>
Mahiru must have been thinking about the incident, too. She sat down on the sofa next<br>
<br>
to Amane, looking a little tired, and leaned back on the cushions. Normally, Mahiru sat<br>
<br>
up very straight and proper. She must have been feeling a bit worn out.<br>
<br>
"Honestly, I was wondering whether I might have overstepped," Amane confessed.<br>
<br>
"No, you saved me. He wouldn't let go, even when I asked him to. Everyone knows I've<br>
<br>
never accepted a love confession, and most guys seem to understand when I turn them<br>
<br>
down, so they give up very quickly—but he was different."<br>
<br>
Amane didn't know how many dozens of boys had told her they loved her, but it<br>
<br>
sounded like a considerable number. Nonetheless, Mahiru had never accepted a<br>
<br>
proposal. It occurred to Amane that if she ever did start dating someone, their time<br>
<br>
together would definitely come to an end.<br>
<br>
"…You really are popular, huh?"<br>
<br>
"Well, I suppose I am. Though it's not something that makes me happy." Typical of<br>
<br>
Mahiru to openly acknowledge it as fact and then clearly express her true feelings on<br>
<br>
the matter. "I appreciate that they feel affection toward me, but the sheer number of<br>
<br>
times this has happened is alarming…"<br>
<br>
Mahiru muttered something else in a somewhat apologetic tone about not knowing<br>
<br>
how to manage all those expectations, and Amane realized she must have to deal with<br>
<br>
this kind of thing a lot.<br>
<br>
Amane didn't interact much with Mahiru in school. Whenever he thought about her,<br>
<br>
he inevitably looked at her, so he was deliberately trying to limit those incidents<br>
<br>
whenever possible. That was partly why he had no idea how often she had to field<br>
<br>
these romantic appeals.<br>
<br>
"And I'm sure you always graciously and candidly decline, eh?"<br>
<br>
"Well, if someone comes to me to earnestly express their feelings, of course I'm going<br>
<br>
to hear them out before I turn them away. It would be rude just to ignore them, after<br>
<br>
all. Though I don't think all of them are equally serious about their feelings, you know?"<br>
<br>
"Oh yeah?"<br>
<br>
"Absolutely. There are some boys who confess their feelings knowing that I'll turn<br>
<br>
them down, like it's all some kind of twisted game. Others just like the way I look and<br>
<br>
want me for a trophy. I have no intention of entertaining something so superficial, of<br>
<br>
course."<br>
<br>
"I'm surprised there are guys who can muster up the will to confess with such flimsy<br>
<br>
reasons."<br>
<br>
He had serious doubts about the first group of guys, and when it came to the second<br>
<br>
group, well, Amane had always believed that a relationship had to be a serious thing.<br>
<br>
If someone was going to confess their love, they ought to really mean it, and he wasn't<br>
<br>
even sure he considered such superficial feelings "love" at all.<br>
<br>
"Well, I politely send those guys away, just like all the others. I can't accept any of their<br>
<br>
proposals on a fundamental level. It's just not possible." Mahiru's voice had turned<br>
<br>
cold again.<br>
<br>
Amane recalled her reaction the first time she had come into his apartment—and he<br>
<br>
had accidentally touched on a sensitive subject—and felt he couldn't say anything<br>
<br>
further.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was obviously not interested in pursuing frivolous relationships. Amane was<br>
<br>
the same way, and he reflected once more on the fact that while his words back then<br>
<br>
had been due to a misunderstanding, it was still very rude.<br>
<br>
Looking over at Mahiru, he could see that her eyes weren't as cold as they had been<br>
<br>
before, and even though he knew that her aggravated, scornful look wasn't meant for<br>
<br>
him, he still shrank back a little.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, it might be a naive question, but… do people think I'm such a simple person<br>
<br>
that I would agree to go out with someone I barely know?"<br>
<br>
"No, I don't think that's quite it…"<br>
<br>
"Well then, why all the hopeless attempts? It's so strange that they think I might say<br>
<br>
yes even though I don't know them. It's just scary being approached by strangers all<br>
<br>
the time," Mahiru muttered, clearly troubled by getting so many confessions.<br>
<br>
"…Do you think they lose control of themselves because they want you to notice them<br>
<br>
or something?"<br>
<br>
"So you're saying it's okay for them to grab me or get rough because they can't control<br>
<br>
themselves?" Her mood seemed to be getting even worse.<br>
<br>
Amane shook his head sharply to dispel any misunderstanding that Mahiru might be<br>
<br>
having about what he said. "No, of course not. There's nothing wrong with having<br>
<br>
feelings for someone, but it's not right to push them on anyone else or selfishly try to<br>
<br>
force their hand. I'm definitely not trying to defend what that guy did. If anything, I'm<br>
<br>
angry about it."<br>
<br>
Mahiru was very beautiful, and Amane couldn't blame someone for wanting to win<br>
<br>
her affection. After all, he had feelings for her himself. But he would never try to force<br>
<br>
his feelings on Mahiru. The moment he used them to justify making her uncomfortable<br>
<br>
would be the moment he'd gone too far.<br>
<br>
This time, at least, Amane had happened to be there to step in. He shuddered to think<br>
<br>
about someone grabbing her like that when he wasn't around. While he knew that<br>
<br>
Mahiru would not hesitate to defend herself, physically if necessary, it was still an<br>
<br>
unpleasant thought.<br>
<br>
"…Is that so?" Mahiru asked.<br>
<br>
"One hundred percent." Amane replied. "It was awful of him to try to force himself on<br>
<br>
you like that… Weren't you scared?"<br>
<br>
"I was a little scared, but if he had tried to hurt me at all, I was going to kick him right<br>
<br>
in the crotch with all my strength."<br>
<br>
Just as he suspected, Mahiru would not have hesitated to retaliate with force. If she<br>
<br>
was being threatened, anyone would understand it if she defended herself.<br>
<br>
"I think that would have taken care of it," Amane said. "Gotta admit, just thinking about<br>
<br>
it makes me a little nervous."<br>
<br>
"Not that I would do anything like that to you, Amane."<br>
<br>
"Well, I hope I never give you any reason to."<br>
<br>
His parents would disown him if he ever tried something like that. And it was against<br>
<br>
his own principles to begin with. Forcing oneself on a girl would be a disgrace to all<br>
<br>
men.<br>
<br>
Amane thought he had made his position on the matter clear, but Mahiru was intently<br>
<br>
watching him with a hint of exasperation.<br>
<br>
"…Of course you wouldn't. Not Amane, the perfect gentleman."<br>
<br>
"Why do I get the feeling that you're angry at me?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, no, I'm just complimenting you."<br>
<br>
"The look in your eyes doesn't seem very approving."<br>
<br>
"Why, you must be imagining things."<br>
<br>
Both her tone of voice and the look in her eyes were far from amicable. Rather, she<br>
<br>
seemed dissatisfied. What she was saying and the way she was saying it didn't match,<br>
<br>
and Amane couldn't figure out what she really meant. His eyes darted nervously around<br>
<br>
the room as he squirmed under her gaze. Mahiru smiled slightly, as if to say that his<br>
<br>
discomfort was unavoidable.<br>
<br>
"Well, when it comes to respecting a girl's space, you're perfect, Amane, but you do<br>
<br>
have one weakness, you know?"<br>
<br>
"And what might that be…?"<br>
<br>
"A weakness to me, am I right?" 4<br>
<br>
Startled by her sudden impish smile, Amane averted his eyes, but Mahiru didn't seem<br>
<br>
to notice his discomfort and leaned against him a little bit.<br>
<br>
She didn't seem to notice his heart threatening to leap out of his chest, either.<br>
<br>
"It might sound a bit presumptuous, but popularity really is its own problem, you<br>
<br>
know?" Mahiru muttered in a hoarse voice. She sounded truly troubled. "I'm aware that,<br>
<br>
physically at least, I'm more attractive than most people. So things like this happen a<br>
<br>
lot, and I'm tired of it."<br>
<br>
"…Sounds tough."<br>
<br>
"It is. Oh, I'm sure there are some girls who might say it would be a wonderful problem<br>
<br>
to have, but honestly, I wish I didn't have to deal with strangers constantly confessing<br>
<br>
their love to me and then getting moody when I turn them down, or even worse,<br>
<br>
latching on to me or flying into a rage. Even at the best of times, it gets exhausting<br>
<br>
having to reject so many advances. And I feel guilty when I turn them down, too, you<br>
<br>
know."<br>
<br>
Mahiru had no mercy for anyone she decided was her enemy. At the same time, she<br>
<br>
was fundamentally a virtuous and sensible girl and generally treated everyone she<br>
<br>
met kindly.<br>
<br>
"I don't think it's any joking matter to be in danger just by being myself," Mahiru<br>
<br>
muttered. "It's not like I worked so hard to improve myself simply to be somebody's<br>
<br>
accessory."<br>
<br>
Mahiru sighed audibly. She sounded truly fed up and exhausted. Popularity certainly<br>
<br>
came with its own set of hardships.<br>
<br>
Amane reached out and gently stroked her hair. Mahiru let him do it, passively<br>
<br>
accepting the reassuring gesture.<br>
<br>
This completely different response to physical contact lay in the relationship of mutual<br>
<br>
trust between Mahiru and him. As he patted her on the head, taking care not to entangle<br>
<br>
his fingers in her fine hair, Mahiru closed her eyes, seemingly enjoying the moment.<br>
<br>
She almost resembled a cat who was letting a trusted companion fawn over her.<br>
<br>
"The persona I use at school is one that I chose, but it makes things difficult when<br>
<br>
people want to get to know me. I won't let anyone touch me unless I want them to."<br>
<br>
As a slightly—no, quite—displeased-looking Mahiru uttered those words, Amane's<br>
<br>
hand hesitated. Right now she was letting him touch her, but he couldn't help but<br>
<br>
wonder if he was somehow taking advantage of her being upset.<br>
<br>
"Why did you stop?" 2<br>
<br>
"Well, I, uh…," Amane stammered. "I suddenly feel a little self-conscious about all those<br>
<br>
times I touched you before…"<br>
<br>
"If I didn't like it, I would have stopped you the first time, so you can relax."<br>
<br>
"G-gotcha."<br>
<br>
"You can touch me even more… if you want." 3<br>
<br>
She peered up at Amane and smiled gently, and in her eyes he could see trust and a<br>
<br>
glimmer of anticipation.<br>
<br>
Amane gulped. "Th-that's, um—" He didn't know how to reply.<br>
<br>
"I'm just joking." Mahiru's expression returned to normal, and she giggled. Her gaze<br>
<br>
dropped. "But please… keep holding my hand. What happened today was a little<br>
<br>
unnerving."<br>
<br>
Amane wasn't sure how to respond to her quiet words or to the heart-wrenching<br>
<br>
distress he could sense welling up inside her, so he just bit his lip and took her hand.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's fingers were elegant and dainty. As he traced his fingers over hers, he could<br>
<br>
feel that they were soft but strong, with a slight callus where her pen usually rested.<br>
<br>
They were not weak in the slightest.<br>
<br>
But he also didn't think they were strong enough to fight off a high school boy. Amane<br>
<br>
wasn't sure whether she hadn't been trying to shake him off or wasn't able to. Either<br>
<br>
way, she had obviously been rattled by what happened.<br>
<br>
Amane gently rubbed and massaged her hand, trying to help relax the fear that was<br>
<br>
coiled up inside her.<br>
<br>
Mahiru smiled, looking a bit better. "It's strange, you know. When you touch me, all I<br>
<br>
feel is comfort."<br>
<br>
"Part of me wishes you'd retained a bit of that caution you had when we first…"<br>
<br>
He looked into Mahiru's eyes, asking silently if it was really all right to let him touch<br>
<br>
her like this, and she answered with a beautiful smile.<br>
<br>
"Oh, you're not satisfied with our current relationship?"<br>
<br>
"It's n-not that I'm not satisfied, but… How do I put this…?"<br>
<br>
"If I wasn't all right with it, I wouldn't be hanging around inside your apartment in the<br>
<br>
first place, and I wouldn't be letting you touch me. I also never would have allowed<br>
<br>
you to rest in my lap."<br>
<br>
"You probably shouldn't have let me do that…"<br>
<br>
"Even though you thoroughly enjoyed yourself?"<br>
<br>
It was hard for Amane to argue that particular point.<br>
<br>
He had happily laid his head down on Mahiru's thighs and fallen into a deep sleep, so<br>
<br>
his insistence that they not do it again rang a bit hollow. Even if Mahiru had been the<br>
<br>
one to propose it, he'd eagerly gone along with the idea in the end.<br>
<br>
And so when Amane replied by averting his eyes somewhat and saying "…That was<br>
<br>
that, and this is this," he received an amused laugh.<br>
<br>
"Ha-ha! Very convenient. I'll have to remember to use that one later. But please… relax,<br>
<br>
all right? I'll let you lay your head in my lap anytime you're tired."<br>
<br>
"Ah, I think I'll refrain…"<br>
<br>
Amane knew if he let himself get accustomed to such a wonderful experience, he'd<br>
<br>
never be able to go back to being on his own. He'd become utterly hopeless, even more<br>
<br>
than he already was, but with somehow even less ability to resist her.<br>
<br>
When Amane gently declined her offer in the interest of preserving what little dignity<br>
<br>
he had left, Mahiru smiled pleasantly. "Oh, that's too bad." She didn't seem particularly<br>
<br>
disappointed. Amane figured she must have been making fun of him.<br>
<br>
"…Don't tease me."<br>
<br>
"I'm not. That's how I really feel."<br>
<br>
In that case, she's just being mean.<br>
<br>
Amane tried squeezing her hand harder to let her know how he felt, but Mahiru just<br>
<br>
laughed like he was tickling her, and he had to quickly turn away to hide his obvious<br>
<br>
embarrassment.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 30: The Angel’s Decision<br>
<br>
"Itsuki! Fujimiya! Let's eat together!"<br>
<br>
It was lunchtime at school, and Amane was on his way to get lunch with Itsuki as usual,<br>
<br>
when a voice he had recently gotten used to hearing called out to him.<br>
<br>
As expected, it was Yuuta Kadowaki, one hand waving in the air, exuding his bright and<br>
<br>
amiable smile as always. Normally, Yuuta ate lunch with other friends, but apparently<br>
<br>
today was different, as he approached them, wallet in hand.<br>
<br>
Yuuta had been speaking to them more frequently since they started their second year,<br>
<br>
but they still weren't especially close or anything.<br>
<br>
But thanks to Amane listening to Yuuta's troubles the other day, an affinity had grown<br>
<br>
between them, and more importantly, Amane had realized that Yuuta was actually a<br>
<br>
pretty nice guy. In fact, he kind of reminded Amane of Itsuki.<br>
<br>
"It's fine with me…," Amane said.<br>
<br>
"Well, you don't mind, do you, Itsuki?"<br>
<br>
"Why do you assume I won't mind? I mean, I won't, but…"<br>
<br>
"Then it's all good, right?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, it's cool. Like, this guy here might have been sorta suspicious of you for no good<br>
<br>
reason, but he warmed up to you pretty quick. And looks like you've gotten pretty<br>
<br>
attached to Amane, too, Yuuta."<br>
<br>
"Attached…?" Amane muttered. "He's not a dog."<br>
<br>
"But Yuuta is kinda like a dog. He's the type where, once you win his trust, he'll always<br>
<br>
stay close by, wagging his tail off. He's like… What's the breed…? Like a golden retriever."<br>
<br>
"You guys shouldn't call people dogs right to their faces," Yuuta scolded.<br>
<br>
But sure enough, once Amane pictured him as a golden retriever, he couldn't help but<br>
<br>
laugh.<br>
<br>
Yuuta noticed Amane's shoulders shaking with mirth and made a sour face, but Amane<br>
<br>
could tell that the teasing didn't really bother him.<br>
<br>
"Don't laugh, Fujimiya."<br>
<br>
"Ha-ha, sorry."<br>
<br>
"Amane was thinking the same thing, I knew it."<br>
<br>
"I mean, it was a pretty accurate description…"<br>
<br>
"Oh come on, not you too, Fujimiya. Look here, I only wanted to be your friend because<br>
<br>
I thought you were a decent guy, you know?"<br>
<br>
"Well, I guess it's a good thing Amane is finally getting a little recognition," Itsuki said.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, c'mon, have a seat."<br>
<br>
"Geez, who do you think you are?" Amane retorted, slapping Itsuki playfully.<br>
<br>
Kadowaki obediently sauntered over, and when he made eye contact with Amane, he<br>
<br>
broke into a beaming smile. If he had pointed that smile at any girl, she would have<br>
<br>
been out cold.<br>
<br>
Amane smiled wryly back. "…Can I ask you something?" he asked.<br>
<br>
"Hmm?"<br>
<br>
"Do you really want to be my friend?" Amane inquired. "I mean, I can't really imagine<br>
<br>
what you'd get out of it, you know?" He hadn't intended to say such a thing, but it<br>
<br>
slipped out of his mouth before he could stop it.<br>
<br>
Yuuta was almost certainly trying to be Amane's friend because he liked him, but<br>
<br>
Amane's memories of what had happened in the past might have been clouding his<br>
<br>
perception.<br>
<br>
Yuuta looked puzzled by Amane's question. "You don't hang out with your friends<br>
<br>
because of what you could gain or lose, do you?"<br>
<br>
"I guess not, but—"<br>
<br>
"Well then, there's your answer. I'm talking to you because I want to get to know you."<br>
<br>
Yuuta's smile was like a bright sunny day. Amane squinted at how dazzling it was.<br>
<br>
"…Okay," he eventually agreed.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, great, I'm glad you're getting along," Itsuki interjected, supplying his thoughts<br>
<br>
on the matter with a cheeky grin. Then his gaze quickly shifted to another part of the<br>
<br>
classroom.<br>
<br>
He was looking at Chitose, who was clinging to Mahiru with a smile, exclaiming,<br>
<br>
"You're so sweet and cute, Mahirun, geez!"<br>
<br>
Chitose had always been a touchy-feely person, and she didn't seem to care that they<br>
<br>
were in class. Everyone was staring, either because they enjoyed seeing two beautiful<br>
<br>
girls bonding over some skinship or maybe because they were jealous.<br>
<br>
To Amane, it looked like the girls were acting as they always did, but Itsuki grinned as<br>
<br>
he watched the two of them joke around.<br>
<br>
"Did something happen?"<br>
<br>
"Nah, nothing."<br>
<br>
Itsuki smiled in amusement and started walking off in the direction of the cafeteria.<br>
<br>
Amane and Yuuta followed after him.<br>
<br>
After dinner, Amane asked Mahiru "…You're sulking, aren't you?" She had seemed<br>
<br>
upset about something lately.<br>
<br>
Mahiru blinked dramatically. "…Oh, did it show on my face?" She poked and prodded<br>
<br>
at her own cheeks, as if she was just discovering her sour expression.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, well, you just look like you're in a bad mood. I've been racking my brain for what<br>
<br>
I might have done wrong."<br>
<br>
Usually when Mahiru was sulking, it was because Amane had done something. But<br>
<br>
today he had barely interacted with her, so he really had no clue what the cause might<br>
<br>
be.<br>
<br>
"If I did something, I'll apologize, but—"<br>
<br>
"N-no, this isn't your fault, Amane. I'm just being narrow-minded."<br>
<br>
"If you're narrow-minded, that would mean most people's minds could be measured<br>
<br>
in millimeters. Anyway, I'm still not convinced I didn't do something."<br>
<br>
There was no way that Mahiru, the girl who basically never got angry, who was always<br>
<br>
ready to hear someone out or put herself in another person's shoes, could be
<p></p>
narrow-minded. Or if she was, then someone like Amane had to be the narrowest.<br>
<br>
He wasn't sure why Mahiru was sulking, but he figured there had to be some reason<br>
<br>
for it. And Mahiru wasn't the type of person to let a stranger bother her, so nine times<br>
<br>
out of ten, if she was sulking, it meant that Amane, the only boy she let her inside her<br>
<br>
guard, was at the root of it all.<br>
<br>
"…It really isn't your fault, Amane, but… Well, it does have something to do with you…"<br>
<br>
"I don't really understand, but if I'm the reason…"<br>
<br>
"You shouldn't apologize when you don't understand why. Actually, I'm probably the<br>
<br>
one who should apologize to you."<br>
<br>
"Now I'm even more confused."<br>
<br>
"It's because I'm so narrow-minded."<br>
<br>
"Okay, okay, assuming for the sake of argument that you are narrow-minded, what<br>
<br>
exactly is bothering you?"<br>
<br>
He didn't think that was even slightly accurate, but for the sake of moving the discussion<br>
<br>
forward, he agreed to pretend like it was true.<br>
<br>
Mahiru refused to look directly at him.<br>
<br>
"…I think it's unfair."<br>
<br>
"Unfair?"<br>
<br>
"Kadowaki."<br>
<br>
"What about him?"<br>
<br>
"It's not fair that he can go talk to you whenever, just because you're both boys.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, I still have to hold back."<br>
<br>
"Hold back?"<br>
<br>
"To avoid causing any trouble… to keep from arousing too many suspicions… to<br>
<br>
preserve your precious quiet life, we have to act like strangers at school. But… it's<br>
<br>
making me lonely, and I'm the only one left out." 6<br>
<br>
She must have been feeling isolated.<br>
<br>
At school, Mahiru was still acting like an angel, just as she always had. She gave Amane<br>
<br>
the same smile as everyone else and kept him at the same distance she used with all<br>
<br>
the other boys. The thoroughness of her act was rather impressive.<br>
<br>
But apparently Mahiru wanted to talk to Amane more than usual. She had been<br>
<br>
refraining from doing so because it would have all sorts of effects on their school lives,<br>
<br>
but now that Yuuta, another popular student who also had problems with the opposite<br>
<br>
sex, had made friends with Amane, she was finding her restrictions too limiting.<br>
<br>
He hated hearing she was lonely, but he didn't think there was anything they could<br>
<br>
really do about that. He frowned, and so did Mahiru. She looked utterly dejected.<br>
<br>
"Itsuki and Chitose and Kadowaki—they all get to have fun with you, Amane, but I<br>
<br>
alone get left out."<br>
<br>
"Argh…"<br>
<br>
He couldn't stand hearing her say that with such a sad look on her face.<br>
<br>
Amane had always talked to Chitose normally, so he was able to talk to her and Itsuki,<br>
<br>
the two people who knew about his friendship with Mahiru, at school like he always<br>
<br>
had. But he couldn't talk to Mahiru, so when Chitose came over to talk to Itsuki, that<br>
<br>
naturally meant Mahiru was left alone.<br>
<br>
She seemed to have some other friends in their class, but she wasn't as open with them<br>
<br>
as she was with Chitose, so no matter what, she seemed a little lonely. Of course, she<br>
<br>
concealed those roiling emotions behind her angelic smile, but Amane knew her well<br>
<br>
enough that her loneliness stood out to him clear as day.<br>
<br>
He understood that, and he wished he could do something about it, but of course he<br>
<br>
couldn't just nod and say he'd start talking to her whenever she wanted. 7<br>
<br>
"…But, well, it would be strange if the class angel suddenly became good friends with<br>
<br>
a boring background character like me, wouldn't it?" 5<br>
<br>
"Why do you always put yourself down like that? It really bothers me." Mahiru frowned<br>
<br>
again and angrily jabbed Amane's nose with the tip of her index finger. "I overheard<br>
<br>
the three of you talking today, and you should really stop being so self-deprecating. I<br>
<br>
wouldn't even bother making friends with you if everything was really so calculated<br>
<br>
and cold. Think about what an absolute slob you were when I first met you. Imagine<br>
<br>
how you looked from my perspective. What did I have to gain by getting to know you?"<br>
<br>
"You're frighteningly persuasive."<br>
<br>
Their friendship had started because Mahiru had felt concerned for Amane,<br>
<br>
particularly because of his diet. A dash of guilt may have played a part as well. There<br>
<br>
was little other reason for the two of them to get to know each other. Looking at it<br>
<br>
objectively, their friendship made no sense.<br>
<br>
But they had become friends anyway, and it had nothing to do with either of them<br>
<br>
weighing risks against rewards—it was because of the way they felt about each other,<br>
<br>
feelings that ranged from happiness to guilt to compassion. Those feelings had been<br>
<br>
the spark that led them to get to know each other better.<br>
<br>
"Of course, now I know you're a kind person with a good personality, so it would be<br>
<br>
an easy exercise if someone asked me to outline the merits of being friends with you,<br>
<br>
but I don't care about any of that. I like you for you, and I'm sure Kadowaki has his own<br>
<br>
reasons, as he said. So it's not good for you to paint yourself in such a negative light.<br>
<br>
That insistence of yours is an insult to all the people who care about you."<br>
<br>
"…Sorry."<br>
<br>
"You don't need to apologize with such a glum face. I just want you to have more selfconfidence."<br>
<br>
He still felt a little sting from being poked at, but that pain wasn't a bad thing.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, we've got to work on your low self-esteem. You need to be more confident."<br>
<br>
"Confident, huh? Well, see…"<br>
<br>
"Even better, I'll start spreading the news that you're a great guy."<br>
<br>
"If you do that to me, I'll die of shame, and everyone will wonder what you're talking<br>
<br>
about."<br>
<br>
It would be sure to raise a lot of suspicions if Mahiru suddenly started praising some<br>
<br>
random guy that, as far as their peers were concerned, she didn't really know very<br>
<br>
well.<br>
<br>
"I'll do my best to make sure it doesn't seem unnatural, okay?"<br>
<br>
"I guess that means you've decided you're going to talk to me at school?"<br>
<br>
"…Look, I don't like being the only one left out. If you don't mind, I want to spend time<br>
<br>
with you just like everybody else."<br>
<br>
Whether or not she was aware that Amane found it almost impossible to resist the<br>
<br>
disheartened face she was making, Mahiru was casting her eyes low and mumbling<br>
<br>
sadly in a way that made him feel like he would go mad.<br>
<br>
"…It's not that I hate the idea, but if we suddenly start acting all buddy-buddy, people<br>
<br>
are going to notice something's up."<br>
<br>
"So if I do it gradually, that's all right?"<br>
<br>
There was no way he could reject her any longer once he saw her eyes light up and<br>
<br>
her depressed expression change, so Amane nodded in assent.<br>
<br>
"Just try not to hype me up too much, okay?"<br>
<br>
"Fine… If that's what you want, I'll never compliment you ever again."<br>
<br>
It hurt to hear her say that, but Amane held his tongue and just gazed off into the<br>
<br>
distance. His school life was about to become a bit stormier.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 31: : Contact with the Angel and the Reaction from Others<br>
<br>
After Mahiru declared her intent to have more frequent contact with Amane, she made<br>
<br>
good on her promise and began to approach him more often. At first, this amounted<br>
<br>
to nothing more than greetings and small talk, so as not to draw undue attention or<br>
<br>
give anyone reasons to think he might be more than a friend of a friend. Mahiru was<br>
<br>
obviously taking great care to avoid any sudden disruptions to his daily life.<br>
<br>
When they discussed their studies, like classmates often did, they didn't get stares of<br>
<br>
jealousy—instead, the other students looked at them with admiration. At times like<br>
<br>
these, Amane was grateful that studying came easily to him. Honestly, it was difficult<br>
<br>
to keep up with Mahiru, since she usually did the whole year's worth of schoolwork in<br>
<br>
advance, but Mahiru was kind enough to tailor the discussion to Amane's level of<br>
<br>
understanding, so they were able to play the part of ordinary classmates without any<br>
<br>
trouble. It also helped that Chitose and Itsuki, and sometimes even Yuuta, were usually<br>
<br>
with them.<br>
<br>
In the way that all people ease into gradual change, Amane got used to having light<br>
<br>
conversations with Mahiru about daily life or their mutual friends or their classes, and<br>
<br>
any looks of jealousy that might have been directed at him from other boys faded into<br>
<br>
the background. Only the boys in love with Mahiru continued giving him sharp glares.<br>
<br>
"Why Fujimiya…?"<br>
<br>
Amane was in his seat in the classroom, staring at his textbooks, when he happened<br>
<br>
to overhear some boys sitting near him whispering in resentful tones.<br>
<br>
Until just a moment ago, Amane had been discussing the previous class's homework<br>
<br>
with Mahiru, and apparently the boys had spotted them.<br>
<br>
As for why Mahiru had chosen to have that discussion with Amane, it was because<br>
<br>
there simply weren't that many people who could keep up with her on that topic.<br>
<br>
Chitose, her closest friend, never prepared for class, so there was no way she really<br>
<br>
understood everything they were supposed to be learning right now. Chitose's<br>
<br>
boyfriend, Itsuki, was the same.<br>
<br>
And so when it came to academic topics, it was easier to talk to Amane. He'd always<br>
<br>
had an easy time with schoolwork, and now that he had Mahiru's guidance, he'd<br>
<br>
become an even better student than before. This was the power of Mahiru the angel.<br>
<br>
"What do you mean, why me?" Amane answered loudly. "I happen to be able to follow<br>
<br>
along with what she's talking about. It's not like we were having some hot-and-heavy<br>
<br>
conversation over here."<br>
<br>
When it came to interactions with Mahiru at school, there was some occasional small<br>
<br>
talk, but it was mostly about their studies.<br>
<br>
Mahiru seemed to be taking her time approaching him, so no one would suspect<br>
<br>
anything, and was careful not to talk about anything normal classmates wouldn't share.<br>
<br>
Rather, they had been having conversations befitting exemplary students, serious<br>
<br>
conversations that left no room for doubt.<br>
<br>
"I guess that's probably true, but…"<br>
<br>
"If you've got a problem with it, you guys should get to studying and come join the<br>
<br>
discussion," Amane continued. "Having you guys look at me all jealous is a real pain.<br>
<br>
Studying is what we're here to do."<br>
<br>
"Huh, no way… I don't get that stuff… I already have no idea what you two were even<br>
<br>
talking about…"<br>
<br>
"Just read the textbook," Amane admonished. "All we're doing is looking ahead of the<br>
<br>
material we're learning now. If that's impossible for you, then I don't know what to say<br>
<br>
other than give up now."<br>
<br>
"That's harsh…"<br>
<br>
"Don't blame me for the sorry state of your studies. And anyway, I don't know what 1<br>
<br>
you guys are thinking, but I'm not that close with Shiina."<br>
<br>
Amane answered them dispassionately, and the other boys ground their teeth in<br>
<br>
frustration. He wasn't particularly good friends with any of them—in fact, he saw<br>
<br>
them all as enemies who might discover his relationship with Mahiru—so he felt no<br>
<br>
obligation to be overly accommodating.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was only starting with light, casual conversation as a way to steadily work up<br>
<br>
to being his friend openly at school. That meant they talked about schoolwork a lot,<br>
<br>
but even if any of these other boys were on top of their studies, he doubted whether<br>
<br>
she would befriend any of them.<br>
<br>
Amane did his best to look utterly disinterested, but the two boys who were speaking<br>
<br>
to him stared at him suspiciously.<br>
<br>
"You… you don't seem bothered by the fact that you and Shiina only talk about school<br>
<br>
stuff…"<br>
<br>
"Don't you have any interest in the angel, Fujimiya?"<br>
<br>
"Not in the angel, no."<br>
<br>
Amane hadn't fallen for the "angel." That wasn't a lie.<br>
<br>
The one he loved wasn't the angel—it was the real Mahiru, the side of her she only let<br>
<br>
him see. He loved the Mahiru who could be infuriatingly stubborn and sarcastic but<br>
<br>
was also tenderhearted and shy, the one who tended to indulge him, who had a<br>
<br>
penchant for feeling lonely, and who sometimes looked so fragile he worried she might<br>
<br>
break into a million pieces.<br>
<br>
According to Mahiru, the angel persona was like a combat uniform she put on to go<br>
<br>
outside, a set of armor she wore to protect her vulnerable interior. And it wasn't as if<br>
<br>
he loved the armor. Of course, after all was said and done, that didn't change the fact<br>
<br>
that he liked Mahiru, but it was for more than just her public facade.<br>
<br>
The two boys now seemed suspicious of how readily Amane had shut that line of<br>
<br>
questioning down. He dismissed without hesitation the idea that he was interested in<br>
<br>
the angel, and they looked at him in disbelief.<br>
<br>
"…You're telling me you don't think she's cute, Fujimiya?"<br>
<br>
"Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not interested in boys, either. Look, I've got eyes. It's<br>
<br>
not that I don't think she's cute—I mean, she's obviously very beautiful, and she has a<br>
<br>
good personality. But that doesn't mean I have to fall in love with her or anything."<br>
<br>
"Then what do you like, Fujimiya?!"<br>
<br>
The boys made a dissatisfied racket, causing their classmates to glance over, which<br>
<br>
was slightly awkward.<br>
<br>
Leaving aside the fact that he was actually enamored with Mahiru, Amane didn't<br>
<br>
understand the reasoning that just because there was a cute, kind, perfect girl around<br>
<br>
that he must, as a member of the opposite sex, be in love with her. If that was true,<br>
<br>
wouldn't every boy in school be lovestruck?<br>
<br>
Just looking around their classroom, it was clear that not every single boy was head<br>
<br>
over heels for Mahiru. There were people who appreciated her as one would a piece<br>
<br>
of art, and there were plenty of boys who were in love with other girls. Of course, that<br>
<br>
didn't change the fact that she was extremely easy to idolize.<br>
<br>
"Lemme ask you: What do you guys like about the angel?" Amane muttered with some<br>
<br>
exasperation, and the two boys' expressions became lively, as if they were finally<br>
<br>
interested.<br>
<br>
"She's super cute, and nice to everyone, and so neat and ladylike, and she can do<br>
<br>
anything! Wouldn't it just be the greatest to have her as your girlfriend?"<br>
<br>
"Huh… right…," Amane mumbled. He knew what they were trying to say, but he gave<br>
<br>
them a skeptical glance questioning whether those were reasons enough to love her.<br>
<br>
"She really is beautiful, and her figure is ideal, too. Like an angel out of a daydream or<br>
<br>
something. I mean, she is an angel, but—"<br>
<br>
"It's not just that she's cute and has a good personality; she seriously can do anything<br>
<br>
she tries her hand at. Even her figure is extraordinary. Though usually her assets are<br>
<br>
hidden under her uniform… But trust me, she looks amazing in her gym clothes.<br>
<br>
Insanely impressive."<br>
<br>
"That's… crazy all right," Amane muttered.<br>
<br>
"I like flat girls like Shirakawa, too, but man, you know, girls with big ones are just the<br>
<br>
best. It's every guy's dream."<br>
<br>
"You guys are being rude. I think it'd be better if you all shut up now, for everyone's<br>
<br>
sake."<br>
<br>
Amane was suddenly in a rather unpleasant mood.<br>
<br>
He could feel the sharp stares trained in their direction from around the room, and<br>
<br>
even though he knew they weren't pointed at him, exactly, it was still enough to make<br>
<br>
his blood run cold. Amane didn't have to look to know just who was giving him the<br>
<br>
angriest glares. He was not looking forward to dealing with that later.<br>
<br>
The last thing Amane wanted was for people to lump him together with these two<br>
<br>
louts, so he made a point of turning his attention to his textbook. Letting his eyes glide<br>
<br>
over the course material that he had been discussing with Mahiru earlier, he sighed<br>
<br>
softly at the two oafs beside him who had begun a particularly vulgar conversation,<br>
<br>
even for high school boys.<br>
<br>
"…You know, I really don't think that Shiina is even going to take a second look at you<br>
<br>
if you keep going on and on about your urges in public."<br>
<br>
Amane figured that most girls probably did not appreciate a guy who participated in<br>
<br>
that kind of dirty talk. All the more so if they themselves had full figures.<br>
<br>
On top of that, he knew that Mahiru did not appreciate it when someone approached<br>
<br>
her just because of her physical appearance. In fact, it was likely to put her off if she<br>
<br>
suspected they were only interested in her body.<br>
<br>
When Amane glanced over at where Mahiru was sitting, he knew the girls must have<br>
<br>
heard them, because Mahiru was patting Chitose's arm, trying to calm her friend's<br>
<br>
raging bloodlust.<br>
<br>
Itsuki sometimes teased Chitose in private, but that was between the two of them. If<br>
<br>
some stranger started casually talking about her body, she had every reason to be<br>
<br>
furious.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's angelic expression never faltered as she comforted her friend, but Amane got<br>
<br>
the feeling that she, too, looked angry somehow.<br>
<br>
I didn't say anything, though…<br>
<br>
In his mind, Amane offered this explanation to Mahiru, then shut out the conversation<br>
<br>
of his two annoying male classmates by focusing on his book.<br>
<br>
The pair didn't seem to mind all the dirty looks they were getting, and Amane felt no<br>
<br>
obligation to step in. Or more accurately, he had already tried to stop them, and they<br>
<br>
were continuing nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Amane quietly let out another heavy sigh when the boys started talking about how<br>
<br>
great the angel was.<br>
<br>
The angel is probably only the angel because guys like you act like that.<br>
<br>
He didn't voice the thought. The words just rolled around in his mouth and vanished<br>
<br>
without ever coming out.<br>
<br>
"…Um, Miss Shiina?"<br>
<br>
That evening, Mahiru had gone to Amane's apartment as usual, but she was wearing a<br>
<br>
stormy expression. She was acting so differently that he unintentionally called her by<br>
<br>
her last name.<br>
<br>
"What is it?"<br>
<br>
Her reply was curt. She was definitely mad about something.<br>
<br>
Seeing the fundamentally gentle and tolerant Mahiru so bothered gave Amane a bit of<br>
<br>
a stomachache.<br>
<br>
"What's got you in a bad mood?"<br>
<br>
"I am not in a bad mood."<br>
<br>
"…No, you definitely are."<br>
<br>
"Am not."<br>
<br>
Mahiru was sitting next to him on the sofa, her expression unchanging. It wasn't exactly<br>
<br>
obvious that she was angry—more like she was oozing displeasure. It might have been<br>
<br>
more accurate to say that the air around her felt prickly.<br>
<br>
Amane struggled to think of what might be aggravating her—then he remembered she<br>
<br>
had seen him talking to their classmates earlier that day.<br>
<br>
"…Ah, maybe you think I joined in with those guys discussing your figure?"<br>
<br>
If Mahiru thought that, he could understand why she would be upset. It probably<br>
<br>
wasn't very pleasant to picture the person you were sitting with drooling over your<br>
<br>
body.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had stiffened at Amane's words, so his conjecture had probably been accurate.<br>
<br>
"You overheard us, didn't you?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, well, uh… I heard that part of the conversation, but…"<br>
<br>
"Sorry. That must have been awful for you to have to hear."<br>
<br>
"No, I, um… I'm used to hearing comments about my appearance, and it's not the first<br>
<br>
time someone's remarked directly on my figure, so it was more like 'Oh, I see.'"<br>
<br>
Mahiru had been conducting herself as the angel for many years, and her statement<br>
<br>
was typical of a girl who never failed to put in the effort to maintain her good looks.<br>
<br>
However, from the way Mahiru said it, Amane could tell she'd been the victim of<br>
<br>
harassment before, and he felt ashamed to belong to the same gender as anyone who<br>
<br>
would be so crude.<br>
<br>
"Well, I was appalled they had the nerve to say those things in a place with girls around.<br>
<br>
I mean, their preferences are their own business, but if they had to get all worked up<br>
<br>
like that, you'd think they'd have the decency to at least do it somewhere in private. I<br>
<br>
can't even imagine saying those kinds of things in front of all those people."<br>
<br>
"One hundred percent."<br>
<br>
The boys should have thought about the time and the place, but they clearly hadn't. It<br>
<br>
had been inappropriate for them to have a conversation like that where other people<br>
<br>
could hear. Actually, as far as Amane was concerned, it was indecent to talk about that<br>
<br>
kind of thing at all.<br>
<br>
"I noticed you were bothered by what they said, Amane, and I could hear that you<br>
<br>
didn't join in. The other girls were impressed, too."<br>
<br>
"Th-thank goodness… You know I wouldn't want to get mixed up with that."<br>
<br>
"…If anything, it made me a bit worried. Maybe you focus a little too much on always<br>
<br>
being a gentleman… and not enough on remembering that you're a man."<br>
<br>
"Isn't that a little harsh?"<br>
<br>
He felt irritated that his classmates, and even Mahiru, doubted his manliness.<br>
<br>
"It's the truth," she said, turning away. She was still giving off hints that she was a little<br>
<br>
upset about something, and when she noticed Amane frowning, she hugged a cushion<br>
<br>
to her knees. "…Apparently you don't consider me very attractive, which hurts my<br>
<br>
confidence."<br>
<br>
"And just what, exactly, brought you to that conclusion?"<br>
<br>
"You apparently aren't interested, for one."<br>
<br>
She must had heard him say he had no interest in the angel.<br>
<br>
"Wait, what I said was that I don't have any interest in the angel. The angel is the<br>
<br>
character you play at school, right? What I meant was that even though I'm interested<br>
<br>
in Mahiru, I don't have much interest in Mahiru masquerading as the angel. I think it<br>
<br>
looks like a tough gig; that's all."<br>
<br>
"…So you do find me attractive, then?"<br>
<br>
"I'd have to be blind to think otherwise. You're incredibly beautiful. As the person most<br>
<br>
often by your side, I can assure you of that."<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't imagine how anyone could see it any other way. After spending so<br>
<br>
much time with Mahiru, he had gotten to know many different facets of her personality<br>
<br>
and had come to regard her with great affection. His love for her only increased and<br>
<br>
never diminished. That alone was proof that she was appealing.<br>
<br>
As Amane spoke, Mahiru began nervously pinching and tugging at the fabric of the<br>
<br>
cushion she was clutching. She couldn't seem to look him in the eye.<br>
<br>
"I-if that's true, then it's fine, but…"<br>
<br>
Mahiru squirmed and nodded like she was hesitating to say something, then buried<br>
<br>
her face in the cushion. Her ears were bright red, poking out from beneath her blond<br>
<br>
hair, and it was very obvious she was embarrassed.<br>
<br>
When she got like this, he knew the only thing to do was give her some space, so<br>
<br>
Amane turned away, leaning against the sofa's armrest.<br>
<br>
He knew if he didn't cool off, Mahiru would be sure to see it in his face when she<br>
<br>
recovered.<br>
<br>
…If it embarrasses her so much, she could just not say anything.<br>
<br>
As the two of them both considered their words, Amane let out a sigh too quiet for<br>
<br>
Mahiru to hear.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 32: The Angel in Cooking Class<br>
<br>
"I'm looking forward to working with you."<br>
<br>
Amane was normally never on the receiving end of Mahiru's angelic smile, so when<br>
<br>
she turned it on him, it made him want to groan.<br>
<br>
"…Same here," he responded in a quiet voice.<br>
<br>
As a rule, Amane never approached Mahiru at school, but he didn't have much choice<br>
<br>
if she was the one who approached him. But this time, it wasn't Mahiru's fault; instead,<br>
<br>
it was simply because they had decided to team up, as friends.<br>
<br>
Their home economics class was going to feature a cooking segment in several days,<br>
<br>
and the students had been given the freedom to form their own teams, as well as the<br>
<br>
right to choose what dishes they were going to prepare. However, they were required<br>
<br>
to put together a menu that applied their lessons about nutrition, and they would be<br>
<br>
graded on that menu, so they needed to take it seriously.<br>
<br>
There were, of course, many potential suitors hoping to be on the same team as<br>
<br>
Mahiru, but she formed a pair with her good friend Chitose, and her partner Chitose<br>
<br>
pulled in her boyfriend, Itsuki. Amane, who thought he was paired up with Itsuki,<br>
<br>
naturally came along with him, so from the outside it looked like he was with Mahiru.<br>
<br>
They were getting even more stares now, and Amane could already feel a stomachache<br>
<br>
coming on.<br>
<br>
Chitose, the main culprit in a sense, was grinning cheekily as she arranged some nearby<br>
<br>
desks for them. "Ah-ha-ha! You look like you swallowed a bug, Amane!" she cackled.<br>
<br>
"And whose fault do you think that is?" Amane replied.<br>
<br>
Once they had pushed four desks together and taken their seats, Mahiru smiled at him<br>
<br>
apologetically, letting her angelic expression slip just a bit. "I'm sorry for intruding,"<br>
<br>
she said gracefully.<br>
<br>
"No, this isn't your fault," Amane insisted. "I'm just worried about whether I'm going<br>
<br>
to be stabbed by those daggers in everyone's eyes."<br>
<br>
"It's just like Amane not to appreciate his good fortune," Chitose admonished.<br>
<br>
"I just don't wanna hog all the good luck, is all."<br>
<br>
It was probably just his imagination, but he thought he heard displeased voices quietly<br>
<br>
agreeing. All the other boys must have been clamoring for the chance to eat the angel's<br>
<br>
handmade food, and he knew they were angry to see it go to a guy who didn't even<br>
<br>
seem to want it that badly. He was being pierced by thorny gazes full of jealousy and<br>
<br>
envy.<br>
<br>
"But you know I'll have a hard time if you're not with me, man," Itsuki added. "Besides,<br>
<br>
all the other teams are groups of friends."<br>
<br>
"Hmm…" Amane couldn't argue that point.<br>
<br>
He wasn't exactly an outcast or anything, but he certainly wasn't popular or charming<br>
<br>
enough to insert himself into another group of friends and expect to get along well. It<br>
<br>
would have been difficult for Amane alone to leave his group now that they were<br>
<br>
assembled.<br>
<br>
"Just give up and accept your fate!" Itsuki insisted. "If you're gonna whine so much,<br>
<br>
maybe we never should have been friends in the first place!"<br>
<br>
"…I don't regret being your friend."<br>
<br>
"Oh, I'm getting all choked up!"<br>
<br>
"Ugh, you know, maybe I'm starting to regret it after all," Amane shot back.<br>
<br>
Itsuki pressed his hands to his face. "A cruel double cross!" he moaned dramatically,<br>
<br>
and then he cackled with cheerful laughter.<br>
<br>
Amane was not particularly impressed with his friend's performance. He was just<br>
<br>
starting to think about pinching Itsuki's cheeks when he heard a quiet laugh mixed<br>
<br>
with a sigh.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was smiling in amusement.<br>
<br>
"I've thought this before, but you two really are good friends, aren't you? It's enough<br>
<br>
to make me jealous."<br>
<br>
"…I guess."<br>
<br>
Even though she already knew they were good friends, Mahiru was acting as if it was<br>
<br>
the first time she had ever mentioned it. Amane felt uncomfortable not being able to<br>
<br>
respond.<br>
<br>
He was grateful she was keeping up the act, but when Mahiru pretended they were<br>
<br>
strangers like this, it also made him feel both embarrassed and frustrated.<br>
<br>
Chitose had been listening to their exchange, and with a grin, she patted Mahiru on<br>
<br>
the shoulder. "Join in if you like, Mahirun!" she said.<br>
<br>
"Hey, stop that," Amane scolded. "Don't try to get Shiina involved in your wild antics.<br>
<br>
You're bugging her."<br>
<br>
"No, that's not the case at all," Mahiru insisted.<br>
<br>
"See?"<br>
<br>
"Don't get carried away, Chitose."<br>
<br>
Chitose liked the idea of getting Amane and Mahiru together. Actually, she more than<br>
<br>
endorsed it—whenever she got the chance to steer the conversation, usually she made<br>
<br>
every attempt to push them together. That was fine when they were at Amane's<br>
<br>
apartment, but they were currently in school, and he wanted to avoid doing anything<br>
<br>
that might draw attention.<br>
<br>
"All right, enough with that stuff," Amane declared. "We've got to choose our menu."<br>
<br>
They only had a limited time to decide on a menu before they would have to present<br>
<br>
their choice, so he insisted on making a quick decision in a bid to show the rest of the<br>
<br>
class he didn't hold any particular feelings toward Mahiru.<br>
<br>
Chitose looked somewhat dumbfounded. "You can't cook, but you're taking charge?"<br>
<br>
"Rude," Amane said, bristling. "I can make… omelets."<br>
<br>
"…You might call them omelets, but what you make is basically scrambled eggs," Mahiru<br>
<br>
whispered quietly so only the three other people in her group could hear, causing<br>
<br>
Itsuki and Chitose to burst into a fit of giggles. Amane, still wary about being in public,<br>
<br>
shot Mahiru a slightly reproachful glance, but she wasn't bothered by it at all.<br>
<br>
Her expression was too much like her usual angelic smile, and Amane turned away<br>
<br>
sharply. Chitose and Itsuki grinned once more at his reaction, which was even more<br>
<br>
unbearable.<br>
<br>
"How about you, Akazawa?" Mahiru asked. "How is your cooking?"<br>
<br>
"Me?… Well, it's good enough to keep me alive," he replied.<br>
<br>
"Itsuki can do pretty much anything around the house, you know," Chitose added.<br>
<br>
Itsuki, who could somehow manage to do most tasks if he put his mind to it, could also<br>
<br>
whip up a flawless meal. Naturally, it wasn't as good as Mahiru's cooking, but it was<br>
<br>
plenty good enough to survive.<br>
<br>
"It's 'cause my mom's never at home, thanks to work. I even used to go over to Amane's<br>
<br>
sometimes to make food for him. Don't do that anymore, though, huh?"<br>
<br>
Itsuki glanced over at Amane meaningfully, and Amane frowned, but Itsuki just smiled.<br>
<br>
"I suppose that's true."<br>
<br>
"…If you guys don't shut up, everybody's gonna find out what a loser I am."<br>
<br>
"Too late, bro."<br>
<br>
"Bit late, isn't it?"<br>
<br>
"You guys are way too in sync."<br>
<br>
"Heh-heh. Well, now you don't have to worry about meals; isn't that great?"<br>
<br>
"…W-wait, I do make some effort!" Amane protested. "Sometimes I make something<br>
<br>
when I'm alone…"<br>
<br>
He didn't think it was good to leave everything up to Mahiru, so on the weekends or<br>
<br>
when Mahiru wasn't around, he did take a stab at cooking. Of course, he stuck to<br>
<br>
simple recipes that could be made in the broiler or using the range.<br>
<br>
Amane had gotten quite flustered, when for some reason Mahiru smiled at him<br>
<br>
affectionately and commended him. "How admirable."<br>
<br>
There was a painful amount of meaning hidden in those words. Amane's cheek<br>
<br>
twitched.<br>
<br>
She was probably teasing him because she was perfectly aware of how much Amane<br>
<br>
struggled when it came to cooking. Compared to Mahiru's cooking, his feeble efforts<br>
<br>
were comparable to a child's. She was probably amused by how terrible they were.<br>
<br>
But he was steadily making improvements—when he started, he couldn't do anything<br>
<br>
for himself—and he needed it to be said.<br>
<br>
"Well, how about we decide on a menu for now?" Mahiru suggested. "Our grades<br>
<br>
depend on it."<br>
<br>
Without making any overt reference to Amane's distressed state, Mahiru, still with a<br>
<br>
gentle smile, tapped the menu worksheet they needed to turn in to complete the<br>
<br>
assignment.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was the best cook among them, so the group had quietly agreed to put Mahiru<br>
<br>
in charge. Even though Amane had learned to make a few things, he was still an amateur,<br>
<br>
especially when it came to creating a nutritionally balanced menu. So it made sense to<br>
<br>
follow Mahiru's lead. After all, she chose the menu for dinner practically every night.<br>
<br>
After some discussion, the group decided on a sanshoku soborodon, a dish of minced<br>
<br>
meat, eggs, and vegetables served over rice, with miso soup and cellophane noodle<br>
<br>
salad on the side, plus almond jelly for dessert. Chitose was grinning from ear to ear<br>
<br>
at the menu.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had casually included an egg dish, probably because she knew Amane liked<br>
<br>
them. That fact did not escape Chitose's and Itsuki's notice, and Amane hid behind his<br>
<br>
worksheet to avoid their taunting stares.<br>
<br>
And then, on the actual day of the cooking class, Amane let out an exhausted sigh.<br>
<br>
He was supposedly working as Mahiru's assistant, but really she was just babysitting<br>
<br>
him. He stood near Mahiru and watched her put on her apron, a sight he had grown<br>
<br>
accustomed to.<br>
<br>
"I'm counting on you for support, okay, Fujimiya?" she said with a smile.<br>
<br>
This wasn't any scheme of Chitose's. The group had simply decided that Amane was<br>
<br>
the least useful when it came to kitchen work. He even had a prior record—he'd cut<br>
<br>
his finger right in front of Mahiru—so they had thought it best not to let him handle<br>
<br>
anything too involved.<br>
<br>
He could understand their reasoning, as all of them were equally intent on avoiding<br>
<br>
any bloodshed, and because they wanted to do their work quickly, since the students<br>
<br>
would be dismissed to lunch starting with the finished teams, so he didn't argue.<br>
<br>
However, he did still take the time to insist, rather loudly, that he "…wasn't exactly<br>
<br>
totally incapable."<br>
<br>
"…Are you sulking?" Mahiru asked him stealthily once she'd finished preparing the<br>
<br>
vegetables.<br>
<br>
As he was measuring out the seasonings, without looking at her, Amane replied, "No,<br>
<br>
of course not. I just feel like I'm being unfairly judged."<br>
<br>
"No one's judging you. It's just, well… um, you can't deny that the rest of us are more<br>
<br>
efficient."<br>
<br>
"I certainly can't."<br>
<br>
It went without saying that Mahiru could cook, and Amane had eaten Itsuki's cooking<br>
<br>
before, so he knew Itsuki could handle himself in the kitchen just fine, and as long as<br>
<br>
Chitose didn't do anything crazy with the seasonings, she could be expected to perform<br>
<br>
reasonably well. Amane wasn't entirely helpless, but he was objectively less capable<br>
<br>
than the three of them, so he couldn't really shoot back if they teased him on that point.<br>
<br>
"And so I think it's best to get you to work in your area of strength. Also, Chitose's liable<br>
<br>
to get carried away with the seasonings, so I think we'd better leave that up to you,<br>
<br>
Fujimiya… It's an important job, you know."<br>
<br>
"That's a serious responsibility… is what I thought at first, but I just have to follow the<br>
<br>
recipe, right?"<br>
<br>
"Preventing a Chitose surprise before it happens is also a crucial job."<br>
<br>
Mahiru let a giggle slip out, and Amane glanced over at Chitose.<br>
<br>
She was simmering rice in a pot while cleaning up after she and Itsuki had prepared<br>
<br>
the almond jelly and placed it in the refrigerator. There probably weren't any pranks<br>
<br>
in the jelly.<br>
<br>
Chitose didn't have an unsophisticated palate, but she did strangely enjoy extreme<br>
<br>
flavors and surprises, so Itsuki had been tasked with supervising her to guard against<br>
<br>
any of that. Plus, this way she could work alongside her boyfriend.<br>
<br>
Laughing quietly, Mahiru pulled out the bean sprouts and carrots that had finished<br>
<br>
simmering in their basket, so Amane pulled off two or three sheets of paper towel<br>
<br>
from the roll sitting on the counter.<br>
<br>
"Fujimiya?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, got it."<br>
<br>
Mahiru handed him the boiled vegetables in their basket, so Amane chilled them<br>
<br>
slightly and used the paper towels to sponge off some of the moisture, then threw<br>
<br>
them into the bowl of seasonings he had prepared in advance, along with the rinsed<br>
<br>
cellophane noodles and julienned cucumber and ham.<br>
<br>
Recalling Mahiru's welcome words that cooking wasn't such a difficult thing as long<br>
<br>
as you measured correctly and paid attention to the instructions, Amane performed<br>
<br>
his tasks according to the recipe. The chef had left him with the simplest jobs, so there<br>
<br>
wasn't exactly a ton to be proud of, though.<br>
<br>
"After I stir in the sesame seeds, I can put this in the refrigerator, right?" he asked.<br>
<br>
"That's right, and then…"<br>
<br>
"Put the noodles in and take the minced meat out."<br>
<br>
The simmering rice was almost ready, so he figured she was planning to get the bowls<br>
<br>
out before too long.<br>
<br>
Mahiru watched as he covered the bowl containing the noodle salad with plastic wrap<br>
<br>
and wrote their team number on it. Apparently, he'd done it right, as she started to<br>
<br>
ready the frying pan without making any corrections.<br>
<br>
The vegetables for the miso soup were already done cooking, and they just needed to<br>
<br>
dissolve the miso paste. Chitose and Itsuki had put the almond jelly in the refrigerator<br>
<br>
to chill and congeal, so all that was left was to get the rice bowls ready.<br>
<br>
Taking care not to bump anyone on the way, Amane exchanged minced meat for<br>
<br>
noodle salad in the fridge and returned to their station.<br>
<br>
As he was walking back to his own group's station, he took a sidelong glance at the<br>
<br>
other teams. Some were doing all right, while others were bickering. One of the teams<br>
<br>
made up of all boys was playing around and wasting ingredients, and the teacher who<br>
<br>
was overseeing this exercise in student autonomy was glaring sharply at them.<br>
<br>
…Seeing that makes me glad I have Mahiru with me.<br>
<br>
The fact that Amane's team had been able to do their work more smoothly than other<br>
<br>
teams was thanks to Mahiru's great familiarity with the cooking process and also<br>
<br>
because they'd chosen a menu that wasn't too demanding.<br>
<br>
"Rather than showing off with some complicated menu, it'll be easier to make a meal<br>
<br>
that's nutritious and doesn't take too much time. Food is something you have to make<br>
<br>
every day, so you shouldn't fixate on things that tire you out, right?"<br>
<br>
Amane had asked her at home about her reasoning for the menu, and that's how she<br>
<br>
had answered. He thought it was a rational way of thinking, typical of Mahiru, who<br>
<br>
made dinner for the two of them every night.<br>
<br>
From Amane's perspective, even this simple menu took plenty of work to get right, so<br>
<br>
this cooking class was bringing him a renewed appreciation of Mahiru's worth.<br>
<br>
Musing seriously to himself that the people in charge of the kitchens of the world must<br>
<br>
have a hard time making every meal, he returned to their counter, where Mahiru was<br>
<br>
giving Chitose instructions. Itsuki was nowhere to be seen, but Mahiru must have<br>
<br>
understood his unspoken question from the look in his eyes, because she promptly<br>
<br>
informed him, "I asked Akazawa to go fetch the dishes from the other room." She<br>
<br>
continued, "All right then, I'm entrusting the meat to you."<br>
<br>
"Got it," Amane replied. "Cook it until the juice dries up, right?"<br>
<br>
"That's right. Thanks."<br>
<br>
Mahiru seemed to be working on the yellow and green portions of the tricolor rice<br>
<br>
bowl. She boiled water to parboil the spinach as she cracked and scrambled the eggs.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had finished preparing the frying pan for use, leaving Amane with only the<br>
<br>
simple task of heating the mixture of meat and seasonings.<br>
<br>
As she used a cloth to dry the pot she had used and washed, Chitose watched him<br>
<br>
frying the meat with a strange look in her eye. "…I thought you couldn't cook?"<br>
<br>
"I keep telling you, I'm not completely helpless. I just look bad next to her; that's all."<br>
<br>
The job he'd been assigned was to simmer the meat and seasonings, stirring the<br>
<br>
mixture with a wooden spatula until the moisture was evaporated. He was offended<br>
<br>
that she assumed he couldn't even manage this much. It wasn't like they were comic<br>
<br>
book characters cooking up dark matter here.<br>
<br>
Amane figured that most recipes got messed up when the cook used too much heat,<br>
<br>
timed things poorly, or added too many ingredients. But they had Mahiru to guide<br>
<br>
them, so they practically could not fail.<br>
<br>
"If you must know, I memorized the recipe so I wouldn't get in the way."<br>
<br>
"How thoughtful of you, Amane."<br>
<br>
"Well, if I didn't pull my weight, the other guys would kill me."<br>
<br>
He could feel them trying to stare daggers through him and could almost hear their<br>
<br>
thoughts (…Is he gonna enjoy the angel's hand-cooked meal without working for it…?)<br>
<br>
So he was trying to do something, at least.<br>
<br>
Amane was fully aware that he was not naturally gifted at cooking, so he had studied<br>
<br>
the recipe even more seriously than he would a textbook, but Mahiru had laughed at<br>
<br>
him. "You don't have to take it that seriously," she had said at home, but he knew he<br>
<br>
ought to be ready just in case.<br>
<br>
Amane checked that the meat was browning and had started giving off a salty-sweet<br>
<br>
aroma, and he stirred it appropriately with the wooden spatula so it wouldn't burn.<br>
<br>
Beside him, Mahiru was using the other burner to cook scrambled eggs. Amane felt a<br>
<br>
little embarrassed that she was making more than the usual amount because she<br>
<br>
knew how much he loved eggs, but he was also happy she was thinking of him.<br>
<br>
"Shiina, do I let this go a little longer?" he asked.<br>
<br>
"That's right," Mahiru answered. "You should let it boil down a little bit more. But it'll<br>
<br>
get dry if you simmer it too long, so please take it off the heat in about one minute."<br>
<br>
"Mm, got it." He nodded.<br>
<br>
Most of the moisture had already been cooked off, so he stirred the mixture with his<br>
<br>
spatula to keep it from burning while Mahiru went back to her own work without<br>
<br>
saying anything further.<br>
<br>
Chitose was watching Amane and Mahiru from the side, and she shrugged, looking<br>
<br>
slightly amazed. "…You know, the two of you seem, well, what can I say…? It's like<br>
<br>
you're newlyw—"<br>
<br>
"Chitose, please mind the miso soup."<br>
<br>
"Eeep, yes, ma'am!"<br>
<br>
Chitose let out an idiotic shriek for some reason and went to take the miso soup out<br>
<br>
of the refrigerator.<br>
<br>
Amane quickly looked over to Mahiru. "…Did something happen?"<br>
<br>
"Nothing at all."<br>
<br>
It didn't seem like nothing at all, but Mahiru didn't seem likely to tell him more, so he<br>
<br>
gave up on getting any more information out of her and turned off the burner he had<br>
<br>
been using to fry the meat.<br>
<br>
By the time Mahiru had finished cooking the eggs and sliced and dressed the parboiled<br>
<br>
spinach with seasonings, Itsuki had returned with the dishes.<br>
<br>
"Aren't you a bit late?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, sorry. Some folks from the other teams came to talk to me."<br>
<br>
Itsuki smiled flippantly, but his face didn't really look like he was joking around. He<br>
<br>
wasn't the type to skip out on something like this, so he probably had actually gotten<br>
<br>
held up talking to someone and couldn't extract himself right away.<br>
<br>
It wasn't clear who he had spoken with or what they had talked about, but Amane got<br>
<br>
the sense that it had something to do with Mahiru. Without her nearby, their jealous<br>
<br>
classmates could speak freely, so they had probably directed their complaints at Itsuki<br>
<br>
in Amane's stead. Of course, this was all conjecture; he didn't really know.<br>
<br>
"Well, at any rate, I did my job, so…" Itsuki pointed to a tray bearing the right number<br>
<br>
of plates and bowls.<br>
<br>
Mahiru smiled gently at him. "Everything's ready. Let's arrange it and take a photo for<br>
<br>
our report, then help ourselves, shall we?"<br>
<br>
"Hell yeah!" Itsuki cheered. "I'm starving."<br>
<br>
"That's 'cause you skipped breakfast, isn't it?" Chitose remarked.<br>
<br>
"Not my fault; I overslept. Can I have an extra-big portion?"<br>
<br>
"I don't mind," Mahiru replied. "I'm going to get the noodle salad now, so please<br>
<br>
arrange things in the meanwhile."<br>
<br>
Amane quickly spoke up. "I'll go with you, then. We've got to put the almond jelly with<br>
<br>
everything else for the photo."<br>
<br>
Amane said he would help, figuring Mahiru wouldn't have enough hands to carry the<br>
<br>
dessert as well, and she nodded at him with her calm smile.<br>
<br>
A little too late, he realized he should have sent Chitose, mostly to get it done without<br>
<br>
inviting unnecessary speculation, but there was no going back now. Amane deliberately<br>
<br>
kept a little distance between them as they headed for the refrigerator in the rear of<br>
<br>
the kitchen classroom.<br>
<br>
None of the other teams had Mahiru in their corner, so most of them weren't finished<br>
<br>
yet. As usual, a few groups were only half-heartedly working through the exercise.<br>
<br>
Amane thought it looked like they were going to get awful grades as he walked past<br>
<br>
them indifferently.<br>
<br>
There was even a team of boys who were chatting and fooling around instead of<br>
<br>
cooking. One of them held his frying pan in one hand and laughed as he leaned away<br>
<br>
from the table with an exaggerated movement—right into the path of a girl carrying a<br>
<br>
pot full of soup.<br>
<br>
In that instant, Amane sensed impending disaster and pulled Mahiru out of the way.<br>
<br>
A few seconds later, he heard a loud splash followed by the faint, permeating smell of<br>
<br>
milk as hot steam whirled around him.<br>
<br>
The girl must have been making a cream soup, given the half a cup or so of thick white<br>
<br>
liquid that was currently spreading across the floor. He peeled his eyes away to<br>
<br>
confirm that none had splashed on Mahiru.<br>
<br>
"Shiina, are you burned?"<br>
<br>
"…Ah, no, it didn't hit me, but…"<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked frozen with surprise.<br>
<br>
The girl who had spilled her soup looked apologetic, and the face of the boy with the<br>
<br>
frying pan who had bumped into her was ghastly pale.<br>
<br>
"Did any of it hit you?" Amane asked the girl with the soup.<br>
<br>
"Ah, n-no, I'm all right. S-sorry…!"<br>
<br>
"It's okay. None of it hit me or Shiina, either."<br>
<br>
Luckily, he had been quick to notice the danger, and neither Mahiru nor Amane was<br>
<br>
injured.<br>
<br>
He was quick to wave his hand and reassure his female classmate, who had set the pot<br>
<br>
on a burner for the time being to apologize, while shooting a glance over at the boy<br>
<br>
who had collided with her.<br>
<br>
As one would expect, the other boys who had been joking around with him kept their<br>
<br>
mouths shut, maybe because they felt guilty. They were looking practically everywhere<br>
<br>
except in Mahiru's direction.<br>
<br>
"…Look, guys, it's fine to live it up a little, but you can't mess around in a place with fire<br>
<br>
and knives and stuff," Amane said. "If someone got hurt and it left a permanent mark,<br>
<br>
you'd never forgive yourselves. Thank goodness nothing happened this time, but what<br>
<br>
would you have done if you'd hurt one of the girls? Could you take responsibility for<br>
<br>
that?"<br>
<br>
It would be no laughing matter if someone got burned—or cut with a knife—and came<br>
<br>
away from the incident with a scar. Amane wouldn't mind if he got hurt a little bit, but<br>
<br>
it would be a serious problem if he injured another person, especially a girl.<br>
<br>
Many girls, and even a lot of guys, would be pretty upset if they were left with a nasty<br>
<br>
injury. And if someone got seriously hurt in a stupid accident like this, it wouldn't be<br>
<br>
strange if they held a grudge.<br>
<br>
Whether the wounded party was Mahiru or the other girl didn't matter. Someone<br>
<br>
acting irresponsibly in a way that could cause injury to another person made Amane<br>
<br>
angry, and he felt compelled to speak up.<br>
<br>
Amane was usually very quiet and mostly kept to himself, so when the guilty boy, who<br>
<br>
looked like he didn't expect to be told off, saw his narrowed eyes and heard his sharp<br>
<br>
tone, he quickly tendered a disheartened apology.<br>
<br>
"S-sorry…"<br>
<br>
Realizing that if he spoke too forcefully, he was likely to cause a fight, Amane switched<br>
<br>
to a more mellow tone of voice. "You don't need to apologize to me, but you'd better<br>
<br>
apologize to Yamazaki, who you ran into, and to Shiina, who nearly got splashed.<br>
<br>
Anyway, be more careful next time. The kitchen can be a dangerous place."<br>
<br>
Then he looked at Mahiru.<br>
<br>
He'd had one arm wrapped around her the entire time, and Mahiru's face had gone<br>
<br>
slightly red. Though he felt some regret over touching her like that, it was too late to<br>
<br>
worry about that now, so he gently released her and, taking care not to make any<br>
<br>
strange faces, pointed toward the refrigerator.<br>
<br>
"Shiina, I'm sorry for touching you without your permission. Please, go ahead and take<br>
<br>
the salad over to our team. I'm going to help wipe up here."<br>
<br>
"I-it's all right; I might have gotten jostled, but I'm the one who spilled everything,"<br>
<br>
Yamazaki, the girl with the soup, stammered.<br>
<br>
"Well anyway, I was involved, too, and all my team has left to do now is eat. It won't<br>
<br>
take long, so don't worry about it."<br>
<br>
She had only spilled a little bit, so cleaning it up wouldn't take that much time.<br>
<br>
After reassuring his distressed classmate, Amane got the teacher's permission and<br>
<br>
pulled off several sheets of paper towel from the roll on the counter and mopped up<br>
<br>
the soup.<br>
<br>
The small amount of liquid was quickly absorbed by the handful of towels. Right as<br>
<br>
Amane was thinking that all he needed to do now was wipe it down with a wet towel,<br>
<br>
Mahiru appeared from somewhere with a damp cloth in hand and did just that.<br>
<br>
"It'll go faster if we work together," she murmured. Then she gave Amane an angelic<br>
<br>
smile from up close, which was deeply unsettling for some reason.<br>
<br>
"Welcome back!"<br>
<br>
After they finished cleaning up, Amane and Mahiru returned to their table carrying<br>
<br>
the noodle salad and almond jelly about five minutes later than expected, and Chitose<br>
<br>
greeted them with an impish grin.<br>
<br>
Amane's and Mahiru's portions, minus the salad and jelly, were already laid out on the<br>
<br>
table, so Amane divided everyone's share of cellophane noodle salad into the salad<br>
<br>
dishes and let out a sigh.<br>
<br>
"I'm so tired…," Amane groaned.<br>
<br>
"You looked pretty cool back there, man," Itsuki remarked. "And bold, for once."<br>
<br>
"It's not like I was trying to cop a feel or anything," Amane insisted. "I had to get her<br>
<br>
out of the way of the soup, that's all."<br>
<br>
He hadn't set out to embrace the angel or anything. And even though no one had<br>
<br>
criticized his split-second decision, several other boys did give him jealous looks that<br>
<br>
made him uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
As for Mahiru, she frowned at him just the slightest bit when she heard what he said.<br>
<br>
Only someone who knew her well would have noticed this.<br>
<br>
"Well, I feel like you really saved me. Thank you for holding me."<br>
<br>
"I only did it because your apron or uniform might have gotten dirty, or even worse,<br>
<br>
you might have been burned. That guy seemed sorry, too, so that's good."<br>
<br>
As one would expect, the boy who had caused the collision received all the blame. After<br>
<br>
all, they were in a place where a single misstep might result in a serious accident. At<br>
<br>
the moment, the boy in question was getting a serious tongue lashing from their<br>
<br>
teacher.<br>
<br>
Amane was satisfied since ultimately no one had been hurt. And he hadn't been put at<br>
<br>
risk, either. Yes, he had touched Mahiru where everyone could see, which could have<br>
<br>
turned out worse than getting burned by hot soup. But judging by the atmosphere<br>
<br>
around the classroom, he seemed to have been forgiven for that slipup.<br>
<br>
"So if you can be that brave in the face of danger," Itsuki remarked, "then why are you<br>
<br>
usually such a weenie?"<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry, did you say something?" It was clear from the look in Amane's eyes and the<br>
<br>
tone of his voice that he was not interested in hearing whatever rude thing his friend<br>
<br>
was planning to say.<br>
<br>
"Nothing at all," Itsuki grinned. "At any rate, we finished making our lunch without<br>
<br>
incident, so let's take that photo, yeah?" He quickly occupied himself by fiddling with<br>
<br>
the camera on his phone.<br>
<br>
The students needed to check recipes and send in their photographs, so they were<br>
<br>
being allowed to use their phones in class, but not for playing around. Itsuki was<br>
<br>
obviously pointing his camera lens at people and not food, so Amane gave him an<br>
<br>
exasperated look, but Chitose excitedly pushed her way into the camera's view.<br>
<br>
"You too, Mahirun!" she urged. "Get in, get in."<br>
<br>
"You guys…," Amane groaned.<br>
<br>
Mahiru blinked dramatically, then drew her seat over slightly closer to Amane's with<br>
<br>
a little smile.<br>
<br>
Et tu, Mahiru…? Amane thought. He was surprised to see her flash him a quick, impish 3<br>
<br>
little grin, just for a second, before she donned her angelic smile again.<br>
<br>
"Come on, you too, Itsuki," Chitose insisted.<br>
<br>
"Wait, but who will take the…? Oh, perfect timing, Yuuta! Come take this picture."<br>
<br>
"Huh, what's this all of a sudden?"<br>
<br>
Yuuta just happened to be passing by, probably on his way back from the refrigerator,<br>
<br>
carrying a tray of thinly sliced pork. Itsuki pressed his smartphone into Yuuta's hand,<br>
<br>
then circled around behind Amane and flashed a peace sign.<br>
<br>
Yuuta looked surprised by the sudden request, but when he saw the completed dishes<br>
<br>
lined up in front of Amane, he seemed to understand.<br>
<br>
With a laugh, he said "Guess I've got no choice" and readied the smartphone. "You guys<br>
<br>
sure finished fast, huh? Okay, I'm taking it."<br>
<br>
"That's 'cause we got hustle, man!"<br>
<br>
"But you hardly did anything, Itsuki," Chitose ribbed.<br>
<br>
"C'mon, don't say that; you promised!"<br>
<br>
Amane laughed at his friend's ridiculous protests. Then he heard the sound of the<br>
<br>
camera shutter. He froze—Yuuta had taken the picture before he'd had time to compose<br>
<br>
himself.<br>
<br>
"That's a good picture!" Yuuta said, before handing Itsuki his smartphone and leaving.<br>
<br>
"Wow, it's not every day I get a picture with Amane smiling," Itsuki remarked.<br>
<br>
"That's 'cause he usually has a sour face on, right?" Chitose said. "Send the picture to<br>
<br>
me, too, please!"<br>
<br>
"Hoh-kay. Shiina, you get it from Chitose, okay?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru had already exchanged contact information with Itsuki, but in this situation,<br>
<br>
with people all around them, it was probably best not to say that out loud.<br>
<br>
More importantly, it bothered Amane that Itsuki was sending the photo to Mahiru<br>
<br>
before letting him check it.<br>
<br>
He shot a look over at Mahiru and got an adorable, albeit restrained, smile in response,<br>
<br>
so Amane could do nothing but groan and watch them quickly share the photo.<br>
<br>
"…No one cares what my face looks like, so we might as well eat," Amane muttered,<br>
<br>
hoping to end the conversation there.<br>
<br>
Itsuki gave him a big grin, so before his friend could return to his own seat, Amane<br>
<br>
poked him and turned away in a huff.<br>
<br>
After that, Amane stuffed his face with the contents of the rice bowl Itsuki and Chitose<br>
<br>
had thoughtfully served up with heaps of egg, and he quickly forgot the shame of being<br>
<br>
photographed with a big grin. Mahiru just wore a happy smile, not paying Itsuki or<br>
<br>
Chitose any attention.<br>
<br>
"Aaamaaaneee, starting today we're eating lunch with you, too!"<br>
<br>
One day, several days after the cooking class, Chitose bounded over wearing a beaming<br>
<br>
smile, dragging Mahiru along behind her. Amane's cheek twitched.<br>
<br>
He and Mahiru were acting less like acquaintances and more like regular friends around<br>
<br>
each other. They'd even begun chatting together in public. But Amane wondered if<br>
<br>
eating together might be moving too quickly.<br>
<br>
Sure, if Chitose gave the pretense of coming over to eat with Itsuki, and Mahiru came<br>
<br>
with her, they could probably live under the assumption that Chitose had simply<br>
<br>
brought a friend. Their classmates shouldn't find that too enviable or suspicious,<br>
<br>
Amane thought.<br>
<br>
Allowing herself to be pulled along by Chitose, Mahiru wore a gentle smile, conducting<br>
<br>
herself as she always did—like an angel.<br>
<br>
But Amane was very troubled because he could also see something a little mischievous<br>
<br>
in her expression. "Ah, maybe I should move over?" he asked.<br>
<br>
Chitose was obviously not going to let him get away that easily. "Don't worry about it!<br>
<br>
We're the ones who decided to join your table, after all."<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't help feeling like this was Chitose's idea. But even when he glared at<br>
<br>
the smiling—no, grinning—Chitose, she didn't seem at all bothered.<br>
<br>
She must have planned this with Itsuki, or maybe he was just happy to be eating with<br>
<br>
his girlfriend, because Itsuki gave his usual smile and said, "Great idea; let's all eat<br>
<br>
together."<br>
<br>
Amane withered under the expected stares of jealousy from all around them.<br>
<br>
"Oh, are Shirakawa and Shiina eating with us, too?" Yuuta asked as he stepped up to<br>
<br>
the table, looking like he intended to join them.<br>
<br>
Amane's stomach started to ache.<br>
<br>
"Yes, we were planning to sit with them today," Mahiru said.<br>
<br>
"Really, now?!" Yuuta smiled. "Well, we should have a rather lively lunch, then!"<br>
<br>
Amane was feeling anything but lively.<br>
<br>
He wasn't upset with Yuuta.<br>
<br>
He was just in complete shock that Mahiru had come over.<br>
<br>
I'm so screwed.<br>
<br>
"…Just give in, Amane; we've got you surrounded," Itsuki mumbled quietly enough that<br>
<br>
Yuuta couldn't hear, and Amane let out a huge, exhausted sigh.<br>
<br>
"Do you usually bring your lunch to school, Shiina?" Yuuta asked, indicating the open<br>
<br>
lunch box in front of Mahiru.<br>
<br>
Amane and Itsuki always ate lunch in the cafeteria, so Mahiru and the others, who<br>
<br>
usually ate in the classroom, had joined them.<br>
<br>
Once each of the boys had returned to their seats carrying the lunches they had<br>
<br>
ordered, Yuuta became curious about Mahiru's lunch box.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, Mahiru was sitting straight across from Amane. Chitose had encouraged<br>
<br>
her to take that seat, and there hadn't been an opening for Amane to escape.<br>
<br>
"Yes, but usually it's just full of leftovers from dinner."<br>
<br>
On weeknights, Mahiru often cooked things that would pack well into a lunch box,<br>
<br>
separating the leftovers into one portion for Amane's breakfast and one portion for<br>
<br>
her own lunch, so that was what she had packed today as well. He could see that the<br>
<br>
box contained the teriyaki chicken meatballs they had eaten yesterday.<br>
<br>
"Wow, a homemade meal?"<br>
<br>
"Yes. But really, it's nothing special."<br>
<br>
"Mahirun, it's not nice to lie!" Chitose interrupted. "You're super talented at cooking."<br>
<br>
"How about apprenticing with Shiina?" Itsuki added.<br>
<br>
Chitose pouted. "Itsuki, you're so mean!"<br>
<br>
"You just need to get her to teach you how to season things. You can cook the dishes<br>
<br>
themselves, but… your seasonings are strange."<br>
<br>
As she clearly demonstrated during the cooking class the other day, Chitose was<br>
<br>
actually a fairly accomplished cook. It was just that her desire to cause mischief often<br>
<br>
led her to experiment with unorthodox flavors. Itsuki often complained that everything<br>
<br>
would be fine, if she just didn't have that bad habit.<br>
<br>
"Okay, I'll get Mahirun to start a one-on-one cooking class. We'll get Amane to be the<br>
<br>
taste tester."<br>
<br>
"I don't think so," Amane replied. "Besides, that'll make a lot of trouble for Shiina. Don't<br>
<br>
be so quick to say stuff like that."<br>
<br>
"Actually, I don't think it'll be any trouble at all," Mahiru said. "I think I'd enjoy cooking<br>
<br>
with Chitose again."<br>
<br>
"Yay! Mahirun, I love you! It'll be so much fun! Leave your calendar open, Amane!"<br>
<br>
Chitose was sitting beside Mahiru, clinging tightly to her with a wide smile.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was smiling, too, as she nodded in agreement. Amane felt deeply moved to<br>
<br>
realize they had become very close friends.<br>
<br>
Chitose just set up a date with Mahiru, right here in front of everyone, just like that.<br>
<br>
Whether it was part of a larger plot, he couldn't say. But when he looked at Chitose, he<br>
<br>
could see that she and Mahiru were smiling pleasantly at each other.<br>
<br>
Amane's face twitched as he noticed all their nearby classmates had their ears pricked<br>
<br>
up, emanating waves of unvoiced jealousy.<br>
<br>
"…Hey, Itsuki?" Amane asked.<br>
<br>
"Hmm?"<br>
<br>
"You think I have any chance of surviving this?"<br>
<br>
"Eh, you'll be fine… probably."<br>
<br>
He was getting dirty looks from Mahiru's fans, aka the boys who were madly in love<br>
<br>
with her. It wasn't just his imagination. This had clearly been Chitose's suggestion, so<br>
<br>
they weren't directing the full brunt of their bloodlust at him just yet, but he feared<br>
<br>
what might happen the next time Mahiru suggested something, especially once it<br>
<br>
became more obvious that they were good friends.<br>
<br>
Yuuta leaned over. "That sounds like fun, huh, Fujimiya?"<br>
<br>
"…If I were you, I could probably get through this without people being so jealous."<br>
<br>
If Amane was attractive and talented like Yuuta, then people would see him and<br>
<br>
Mahiru as equals, and even if they were jealous, they'd think there was little to be done<br>
<br>
about it and simply give up.<br>
<br>
"But I'm also jealous of you, Fujimiya."<br>
<br>
"Jealous of what?"<br>
<br>
"All sorts of stuff," Yuuta said cryptically. Then he laughed.<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't do anything but tilt his head in puzzlement.<br>
<br>
Itsuki chimed in, "Now, hold on a minute. There may be something to what Yuuta's<br>
<br>
saying."<br>
<br>
"Seriously?"<br>
<br>
"It's hard for people to recognize what they have. And those who have it can't<br>
<br>
understand the feelings of those who don't. On top of that, we all want what we don't<br>
<br>
have. Chi's definitely always whining about what she hasn't got."<br>
<br>
"Meaning what?"<br>
<br>
"Well, what's one thing that Mahiru has plenty of but Chi doesn't have…?"<br>
<br>
"You're definitely thinking something perverted right now, aren't you?" Chitose<br>
<br>
interrupted. Apparently, she had been listening to their conversation, and even though<br>
<br>
she was wearing a broad grin, her eyes were not smiling.<br>
<br>
Realizing that this topic was a proverbial land mine, Amane shut his mouth and<br>
<br>
watched as Chitose and Itsuki started bantering back and forth. Then he glanced over<br>
<br>
at Mahiru. She looked perplexed at Chitose and Itsuki's exchange, but when she met<br>
<br>
Amane's eyes, her expression changed into a smile.<br>
<br>
It wasn't her angelic smile, but something closer to the happy yet bashful expression<br>
<br>
she let him see at home, so Amane got flustered and quickly averted his eyes.<br>
<br>
"Were you surprised?"<br>
<br>
At home, Mahiru was grinning impishly.<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't help but give her a wry smile back. "Surprised? I mean, I did think you<br>
<br>
came on pretty strong."<br>
<br>
"I know I said I was going to take it slow, but I thought it was about time to go to the<br>
<br>
next step. I've also recently realized we won't make any progress if I don't push you a<br>
<br>
little bit."<br>
<br>
"That's true."<br>
<br>
She had probably been extra proactive because she knew Amane was constantly ready<br>
<br>
to flee, but in that setting, he had been surrounded and couldn't get away easily.<br>
<br>
Amane had been startled because he hadn't expected Mahiru to be that pushy, but they<br>
<br>
had simply talked. She hadn't tried to touch him or anything, so his mind was at ease.<br>
<br>
If she had touched him innocently and casually like she did at home, he had no doubt<br>
<br>
that deadly blades of jealousy would have closed in on him for the kill. He depended<br>
<br>
on her, and she trusted him more than anyone else, but their classmates had no idea<br>
<br>
about any of that.<br>
<br>
"I'm trying my best to take things bit by bit, so that it doesn't shake up your routine<br>
<br>
too much. But Amane, if something bothers you, please tell me, okay?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru was perfectly aware of her popularity. Amane knew she was taking great pains<br>
<br>
not to become too friendly with him too quickly, all so their classmates wouldn't get<br>
<br>
jealous. Typical Mahiru—her first concern was protecting him.<br>
<br>
Still, he couldn't deny that, this time, he felt like Chitose had gone a little too far. It was<br>
<br>
too late to do anything about it now, though, so he would just have to be more cautious<br>
<br>
moving forward.<br>
<br>
"Well, it's okay for the time being…," Amane said. "Though, I do get jealous looks."<br>
<br>
"Oh really? That's… Don't you hate that…?"<br>
<br>
Apparently, she was still concerned about the fact that Amane had been sullen at first.<br>
<br>
"But now I understand you were lonely. We were wrong to leave a friend out, and it<br>
<br>
was obviously hard on you."<br>
<br>
"…A friend, huh?" 1<br>
<br>
"Hmm?"<br>
<br>
"No, nothing."<br>
<br>
It definitely seemed like something was bothering her, but Mahiru didn't appear<br>
<br>
inclined to talk about it. When she turned away, Amane realized he must have done<br>
<br>
something to dampen her high spirits.<br>
<br>
He went right ahead and stroked her hair.<br>
<br>
"…You aren't thinking you can solve everything just by patting my head a couple times,<br>
<br>
right?"<br>
<br>
"I don't, but I thought it might make you happy."<br>
<br>
"Well, it does, but… please don't do it to just any girl when you're trying to smooth<br>
<br>
things over."<br>
<br>
"I don't do it to anyone but you, Mahiru…" 2<br>
<br>
To begin with, the only other girl I'm friends with is Chitose. And there's no way I'm doing<br>
<br>
this with her. Besides, I don't think it would make her very happy. No, Mahiru's the only<br>
<br>
person I'd ever do this with—and the only person I'd ever want to. She's the only one I<br>
<br>
want to pamper.<br>
<br>
Amane thought he had made it clear that he was being serious. But Mahiru still looked<br>
<br>
upset, and she pounded her fist into one of the cushions.<br>
<br>
Amane started drawing his hand back and was surprised when she head-butted him<br>
<br>
in the upper arm. It didn't hurt, but he was still shocked by how Mahiru had become<br>
<br>
noticeably more aggressive lately.<br>
<br>
"…Amane, you dummy."<br>
<br>
"Why do you say that?"<br>
<br>
"Just how hard do I have to try…?" 2<br>
<br>
"I—I don't really understand what you're saying, but you'll wear yourself out if you try<br>
<br>
anything too hard, so you should probably take it easy…"<br>
<br>
"If I don't prod you along, we'll never get anywhere."<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked a bit resentful as he peeked over the top of his shoulder, and yet he<br>
<br>
thought he could see embarrassment and a touch of anticipation in her shimmering<br>
<br>
eyes.<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't bring himself to meet her gaze. "It r-really seems like you want<br>
<br>
something from me."<br>
<br>
"…I just want what happens next…"<br>
<br>
Next—?<br>
<br>
Mahiru must have wanted something further from Amane, but at the moment, she<br>
<br>
didn't seem to be making any additional requests, so for the time being, Amane<br>
<br>
decided to continue stroking her head gently and made every effort to please her.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 33: The Angel’s Proposal<br>
<br>
"Golden Week's pretty soon, huh?" Amane muttered quietly, gazing at the calendar on<br>
<br>
the shelf.<br>
<br>
April had been a busy month, and he had been preoccupied with moving up a grade<br>
<br>
and Mahiru's big push to be friendly with him even at school. So before he knew it, the<br>
<br>
end of the month was fast approaching, and Golden Week, highly anticipated by<br>
<br>
students and adults alike, would soon be upon them.<br>
<br>
Amane didn't particularly dislike his studies. Actually, if asked, he would say he enjoyed<br>
<br>
them. Going to school was a little bit of a hassle but not any great hardship, so he<br>
<br>
wasn't necessarily all that thrilled about the break. He simply thought it would be nice<br>
<br>
to have some more time to relax.<br>
<br>
Unlike last year, this year Mahiru would be with him for Golden Week, so he wouldn't<br>
<br>
be bored.<br>
<br>
Chitose had already claimed one of the days of his break for "taste testing at Mahiru's<br>
<br>
cooking class," so far from boring, his vacation promised to be eventful and probably<br>
<br>
difficult.<br>
<br>
"Another long break is coming up…," Mahiru muttered.<br>
<br>
"Yep, but is it me or do you not sound too thrilled?"<br>
<br>
"It's not that I don't like breaks. I was just wondering how I'll kill the time."<br>
<br>
Apparently Mahiru felt similarity. Both of them were homebodies, and they hadn't<br>
<br>
made any plans to speak of.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, I mean, I'm happy enough to get a break, but I don't really have anything to do."<br>
<br>
Amane hadn't fallen behind in his schoolwork or anything, so he didn't feel like he<br>
<br>
needed to go out of his way to pack his vacation with studying.<br>
<br>
He didn't have an especially strong desire to partake in his hobbies of walking or<br>
<br>
reading, and it wasn't like he needed to make plans for those anyway. Same with video<br>
<br>
games. He really didn't have any plans.<br>
<br>
"…Amane, are you free over the break?"<br>
<br>
"I guess I am."<br>
<br>
As things stood, all he had planned were his day as a taste tester for the impromptu<br>
<br>
cooking class and going to karaoke at some point with Itsuki and Yuuta. The break was<br>
<br>
a whole week long, so his schedule was still wide open.<br>
<br>
He was about to say he'd most likely be relaxing at home, when he noticed Mahiru<br>
<br>
staring up at him.<br>
<br>
"What's the matter?"<br>
<br>
He met Mahiru's gaze and saw that she looked like she had something to say. She<br>
<br>
reached for her smartphone, which was on top of the table.<br>
<br>
More accurately, she reached for the phone case.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's phone case was the wallet type with spots to keep cards and such, and from<br>
<br>
one of the card slots, she pulled a small plastic bag with a zipper.<br>
<br>
Inside it were a number of folded slips of paper, and Mahiru took one of them out and<br>
<br>
opened it up to show Amane.<br>
<br>
Before he even had time to recognize it, he was looking at one of the DO ANYTHING<br>
<br>
YOU SAY coupons he had given her a little over a month earlier.<br>
<br>
Mahiru held out the coupon, decorated with an illustration of a bear that Amane<br>
<br>
personally thought he had drawn quite well, and looked up at him pointedly again.<br>
<br>
"Can I use it?"<br>
<br>
"You can ask me to do anything you like."<br>
<br>
"…Over Golden Week, I want one day with you," she said timidly. "I want to go shopping,<br>
<br>
and hang out, and whatever else I request. All right?"<br>
<br>
Amane let out a quiet laugh. "Come on, I would go shopping and stuff with you if you<br>
<br>
asked. You don't really need to use a coupon for something so simple."<br>
<br>
She probably wanted him to get all dressed up to take her out, but he would have done<br>
<br>
that for her anytime, so he didn't think she had to go to so much trouble.<br>
<br>
He laughed at her using her request for such a trivial thing, but Mahiru shook her head<br>
<br>
with an earnest look in her eyes.<br>
<br>
"Since I'm using the coupon… I get to ask for anything I feel like on that day."<br>
<br>
"I-if you insist, that's fine, but… what are you planning to make me do?"<br>
<br>
"…C-carry my bags."<br>
<br>
"Yes, yes, as you wish."<br>
<br>
He was tempted to crack a joke about her making him carry super-heavy bags, but<br>
<br>
Mahiru just nodded. Even Mahiru, who was at heart an indoor person, sometimes<br>
<br>
enjoyed going on an outing, and if she wanted him to accompany her, he intended to<br>
<br>
do just that, as much as she desired. Besides, it was sure to have its benefits.<br>
<br>
Although Amane would have preferred not to start a fresh wave of rumors about<br>
<br>
Mahiru's mystery man, life would be dull if the fear of rumors kept them from going<br>
<br>
anywhere.<br>
<br>
"So where do you plan on taking us?"<br>
<br>
"Ah, I—I haven't decided yet, but—"<br>
<br>
"You haven't decided…?"<br>
<br>
"…I mean, I'm not sure what kinds of places you like, so…"<br>
<br>
"Huh, me?"<br>
<br>
"Well, if we're out together, I thought it would be nice to pick a place we could both<br>
<br>
enjoy. Is that all right?"<br>
<br>
No one in the world could have refused Mahiru as she grabbed hold of his sleeve and<br>
<br>
looked up at him imploringly.<br>
<br>
Amane's breath caught in his throat, and his eyes darted about in confusion. Then he<br>
<br>
roughly brushed back his hair and let out a small sigh.<br>
<br>
"…I was just planning to go along with wherever you wanted to go, Mahiru, but well…<br>
<br>
in that case, there is one place I'd like to go."<br>
<br>
It was difficult for him to go in alone, but it was someplace he always wanted to try<br>
<br>
going at least once.<br>
<br>
"Where is that?"<br>
<br>
"Promise not to laugh."<br>
<br>
"I won't laugh."<br>
<br>
"…A cat cafe ."<br>
<br>
That's right, a cat cafe , filled to the brim with adorable cats.<br>
<br>
Amane liked animals a fair amount, but of course he wasn't able to keep a pet in an<br>
<br>
apartment and could only admire animals in magazines or other people's pets. But he<br>
<br>
was too afraid of what people might think if they saw a single guy going to an animal<br>
<br>
cafe . He was just too embarrassed to go.<br>
<br>
However, if Mahiru was with him, he could go without worrying about other people's<br>
<br>
stares following him. They might stare for other reasons, but he felt like he could at<br>
<br>
least enter a cafe without reservations if Mahiru was by his side.<br>
<br>
Besides all that, Amane also thought Mahiru would look very cute playing with cats,<br>
<br>
but of course he couldn't say that out loud.<br>
<br>
"…Well, I th-thought that if we were together, I wouldn't be embarrassed. Do you<br>
<br>
mind?"<br>
<br>
"N-no, not at all! All right then… Let's go together, shall we?"<br>
<br>
"…Yeah."<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't hide his nervousness. He felt both grateful and awkward that Mahiru<br>
<br>
had accepted his request. She giggled softly, and heat began to creep up Amane's face.<br>
<br>
Quickly, he changed the subject.<br>
<br>
"What should we do after the cafe ?"<br>
<br>
"After that, we'll go shopping together, and… ah, I want to try going to an arcade. I've<br>
<br>
never been to a place like that."<br>
<br>
Amane was not surprised to hear that the aristocratic Mahiru had never been to a<br>
<br>
game center. But she was apparently interested, so in that case, he was more than<br>
<br>
willing to take her to one and teach her the ropes.<br>
<br>
The last game center he visited would probably have gotten a new shipment of stuffed<br>
<br>
animals she would like by now, and it would be fun to win them together.<br>
<br>
"All right, sounds like that'll be good. We'll go to a cat cafe , eat lunch, go shopping, and<br>
<br>
go to a game center, okay?"<br>
<br>
Amane sighed with relief once they had settled on their schedule for the day, and<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked up again so he could see her face.<br>
<br>
"Yep, I'm really looking forward to it."<br>
<br>
He nearly stopped breathing when she looked at him so bashfully.<br>
<br>
"I can't wait for the break to be here," she added quietly, and to Amane, it sounded like<br>
<br>
she was looking forward to their outing from the bottom of her heart. She hugged the<br>
<br>
cushion tightly, clearly in a good mood.<br>
<br>
Amane was momentarily stunned by her sweet smile. He could feel his heart pounding.<br>
<br>
"…Me too," he managed to reply hoarsely.<br>
<br>
The surprise attack from the angel really made his heart ache<br>
 <br>
Chapter 34: Fooling Around in the Angel’s Cooking Classroom<br>
<br>
"Welcome to the first-ever Mahirun Cooking Class!"<br>
<br>
Chitose made this announcement with the rhythm and energy of a television cooking<br>
<br>
program's intro. Amane shot her an annoyed look.<br>
<br>
Golden Week had started, and they had decided to hold Mahiru's cooking class on the<br>
<br>
first day of the break. The venue was Amane's apartment, for the simple reason that it<br>
<br>
was an easy place for Mahiru and Chitose to meet.<br>
<br>
Chitose's family was at her house, so they wouldn't be able to get too noisy, and Mahiru<br>
<br>
had volunteered her place, but Amane had balked at going into a girl's apartment, so<br>
<br>
they had settled on his.<br>
<br>
Wearing an apron, Chitose was getting herself all worked up. "Yaaay! We've invited<br>
<br>
Miss Mahiru Shiina to be our lecturer for the course!"<br>
<br>
Mahiru, too, was wearing her apron and a wry smile as she stood next to Chitose.<br>
<br>
"You didn't invite her anywhere," Amane insisted. "You're also a guest here, you know."<br>
<br>
"And as our taste tester… we've invited the extremely tiresome Mr. Amane Fujimiya!"<br>
<br>
"Oh, shut up. Also, this my house."<br>
<br>
"He's no fun at all!"<br>
<br>
Amane just couldn't keep up with Chitose's incredibly high-energy personality this<br>
<br>
early in the morning. It was just past nine. They had planned to finish cooking around<br>
<br>
lunchtime, so this was the only time they could meet.<br>
<br>
Amane didn't really mind the hour, but Chitose was a lot to deal with right after waking<br>
<br>
up.<br>
<br>
"…Sorry about this, first thing in the morning…," Mahiru apologized.<br>
<br>
"No, it's fine. You are making me lunch, after all," Amane insisted. "Though, speaking<br>
<br>
of which, please keep an eye on Chitose so she doesn't put anything strange in it."<br>
<br>
"O, ye of little faith!"<br>
<br>
"Have you forgotten your previous offense on Valentine's Day…?"<br>
<br>
He still hadn't forgotten the taste of her prank chocolates. The ones with nothing weird<br>
<br>
in them had been delicious, of course, but the taste of the surprise special chocolates<br>
<br>
had been shocking enough that he could recall it even now. And he couldn't trust<br>
<br>
Chitose's palate, since she claimed she had been able to eat those experimental pieces<br>
<br>
like regular sweets.<br>
<br>
"Ah-ha-ha, but those were meant to be a prank. It'll be fine if I'm cooking normally.<br>
<br>
Probably."<br>
<br>
"That 'probably' worries me, you ass… I'm begging you, please make something I can<br>
<br>
eat."<br>
<br>
"Don't worry about it!" said Chitose confidently as she started rolling up her sleeves.<br>
<br>
Amane felt a tinge of anxiety as he watched the girls set up, but he believed Mahiru<br>
<br>
would probably intervene on his behalf somehow.<br>
<br>
Mahiru didn't compromise on dishes she planned to serve to other people, and she<br>
<br>
was the one running this lesson, so Amane was confident they would make the food<br>
<br>
properly, and everything would be fine.<br>
<br>
With Chitose in tow, Mahiru headed for his kitchen as if it were her own home and<br>
<br>
read out the names of the dishes on the day's menu.<br>
<br>
Namely, today's lunch would consist of a quiche and salad, with shrimp bisque and a<br>
<br>
saute of any excess ingredients. She had apparently decided to answer Amane's<br>
<br>
request to include shrimp.<br>
<br>
He was sure that everything would go okay, but he still worried about Chitose putting<br>
<br>
something strange into the quiche.<br>
<br>
"…I feel like you're being needlessly wary…," Chitose protested. Maybe she had noticed<br>
<br>
him staring at her.<br>
<br>
Amane averted his eyes and flopped down on the sofa. His job was to be a taste tester,<br>
<br>
so he didn't really have to do anything, and that suited him just fine. He wasn't totally<br>
<br>
useless as Mahiru's helper, but that was Chitose's role today, and anyway, he had been<br>
<br>
instructed by Mahiru to sit down, so he couldn't move from his spot. 1<br>
<br>
And so he had lots of free time.<br>
<br>
He looked into the kitchen and saw the two girls in their aprons pleasantly chatting as<br>
<br>
they started their work.<br>
<br>
They were both beautiful girls in different ways, and having them both here, wearing<br>
<br>
aprons and cooking in his apartment, would surely make any other boy in their class<br>
<br>
drool with envy, Amane mused, as if he were an uninvolved observer.<br>
<br>
Fighting off a second round of anxiety over whether the practical jokester might pull<br>
<br>
something outrageous, Amane let his eyes drift closed, unsure of what else to do with<br>
<br>
his glut of free time.<br>
<br>
Apparently, cooking class would take several hours, so they probably wouldn't mind if<br>
<br>
he took a little nap. It was his apartment, after all, so the only one who could blame<br>
<br>
him for anything was… Mahiru.<br>
<br>
Amane let out a small yawn and made himself comfortable on the sofa.<br>
<br>
When he came to, Amane detected a sweet scent nearby. It was an aroma he had<br>
<br>
become used to, a sweet fragrance that was milky and floral, hard to describe but<br>
<br>
extremely pleasant, so without thinking, he inhaled deeply.<br>
<br>
In his barely conscious state, he brought his face closer to the source of the smell and<br>
<br>
felt something warm and soft to the touch. When he snuggled his cheek closer to the<br>
<br>
pleasant warmth, it started to squirm.<br>
<br>
"…Ah, um, that tickles…," said a halting voice from somewhere very close by. Amane<br>
<br>
realized someone was patting his thigh. This quickly dragged his dim consciousness<br>
<br>
up to the surface, and when he pried open his heavy eyelids… what he saw was an<br>
<br>
expanse of smooth milky white.<br>
<br>
He nervously lifted his head and found Mahiru's flushed face incredibly close to his.<br>
<br>
She looked very embarrassed.<br>
<br>
"…Mahiru?"<br>
<br>
"Yes?"<br>
<br>
"…Uh… good morning?"<br>
<br>
"Good morning. Although… actually, it's already time to say good afternoon."<br>
<br>
He looked at the digital clock on the shelf and saw that it was past noon.<br>
<br>
He had dozed off for quite a while, he realized. But what was Mahiru doing by his side?<br>
<br>
"When I sat down next to you, you leaned onto me."<br>
<br>
Mahiru answered his unspoken question, her cheeks still tinged slightly red.<br>
<br>
Apparently, he had nestled his face into the area near her shoulder. The shirt she was<br>
<br>
wearing today had a fairly open neckline, which left some skin peeking out, and that<br>
<br>
seemed to be where he had stuck his face.<br>
<br>
If he was unlucky, she might consider this a matter of sexual harassment, so he<br>
<br>
prepared himself for her anger, but Mahiru seemed more embarrassed than angry and<br>
<br>
just cast her eyes downward.<br>
<br>
Personally, he would have preferred for her to get mad, because he was truly at a loss<br>
<br>
for what to do when she reacted that way. He appeared to have been forgiven, which<br>
<br>
made him uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
"That's— I'm sorry," Amane apologized. "It must have been a pain."<br>
<br>
"N-no, not at all!" she insisted.<br>
<br>
"Quite the contrary, Mahirun said 'I'm going to take advantage of the fact that Amane's<br>
<br>
half asleep' and sat down to catch your head."<br>
<br>
"Chitose!" Mahiru turned even redder.<br>
<br>
"And just when did you two start calling each other by your first names, I wonder?"<br>
<br>
Chitose grinned.<br>
<br>
"…Chitose."<br>
<br>
"Don't scowl at me, Amane. You're the one who was careless!"<br>
<br>
He couldn't argue with that. In his half-conscious state, he'd called Mahiru by her first<br>
<br>
name even though Chitose was there. That was his error.<br>
<br>
"And anyway, Mahirun already told me about how you two talk when no one else is<br>
<br>
around…"<br>
<br>
"Look, you—," Amane growled.<br>
<br>
"S-sorry," Mahiru mumbled.<br>
<br>
He quickly shook his head. "No, you're not to blame here, Mahiru."<br>
<br>
Chitose cackled merrily. "Well, as far as I'm concerned, I think it's just great that the<br>
<br>
two of you are getting so friendly! It's not a bad thing at all."<br>
<br>
"You're a real pain, you know that?" Amane glared. "It's seriously not what you're<br>
<br>
thinking."<br>
<br>
"Ohhh?"<br>
<br>
"What?"<br>
<br>
"Uh-uh, nothing. Nooothing at aaall!"<br>
<br>
Chitose sure seemed like she had a lot to say about nothing, but she shrugged as if she<br>
<br>
had no intention of expressing it through words. Amane knew that when she got like<br>
<br>
this, it was no good trying to question her, so he gave up on asking her anything further.<br>
<br>
Beside him, Mahiru looked slightly concerned.<br>
<br>
"…Mahiru?"<br>
<br>
"Huh? Oh, it's nothing."<br>
<br>
Mahiru seemed to come to her senses when he spoke to her. She hurriedly put on a<br>
<br>
smile and shook her head, so he knew he couldn't question her any further, either. All<br>
<br>
he could do was shut his mouth.<br>
<br>
"…So we made lunch as promised. Wanna eat?" Chitose asked.<br>
<br>
"Sure. I can't believe I dozed off until lunch…"<br>
<br>
"You slept like a log, so we had plenty of time to play around, looking at your sleeping<br>
<br>
face."<br>
<br>
"…I don't suppose you pulled any pranks?"<br>
<br>
"I did not!" Chitose insisted, though he knew better than to believe her. "What's got<br>
<br>
you so worried, young man?"<br>
<br>
"You did something other than a prank, didn't you?" Amane asked suspiciously.<br>
<br>
"I'm telling you: I didn't do a thing!"<br>
<br>
"I wonder. Mahiru, did she do anything to the food?"<br>
<br>
He looked over at Mahiru to confirm, but she must have been caught by surprise when<br>
<br>
he suddenly brought up the subject. She looked confused and smiled wryly.<br>
<br>
"Chitose didn't do anything, but…"<br>
<br>
"Really? If she did, I'm thinking of squeezing her until she pops—"<br>
<br>
"No violence!"<br>
<br>
Chitose was cackling with laughter even as she protested, and Amane could only sigh<br>
<br>
in exasperation.<br>
<br>
Finally—though Amane didn't really feel as if any time had passed, since he had been<br>
<br>
asleep—it was indeed lunchtime.<br>
<br>
Even Chitose seemed to have taken her cooking seriously for a change, and the table<br>
<br>
was set with a beautifully cooked quiche and a bisque soup that was giving off the rich<br>
<br>
aroma of shrimp.<br>
<br>
They had served everything up on individual plates, so the salad, quiche, bisque, and<br>
<br>
shrimp saute were carefully arranged to show off the rich array of colors. It looked<br>
<br>
like a lunch that might be served at a cute cafe .<br>
<br>
"Wow, everything looks great!" Amane exclaimed. "…Mahiru, how's the flavor?"<br>
<br>
"It's all fine." She nodded. "Chitose didn't add anything strange, and I tasted everything<br>
<br>
as we went."<br>
<br>
"Great."<br>
<br>
"You really don't trust me, geez! I made everything properly today, too. Rude."<br>
<br>
Chitose was in a huff, but she had a history of launching surprise attacks right after<br>
<br>
saying something similar, so Amane knew better than to let his guard down. This time,<br>
<br>
though, Mahiru had been there to supervise, so Amane could mostly relax and eat.<br>
<br>
"Ah, Mahiru made this quiche. I made one to give to Itsuki."<br>
<br>
"You're gonna give him a whole quiche…?"<br>
<br>
"It's a little one, about the size of my palm, so it's fine. Eh-heh-heh, I wonder if he'll be<br>
<br>
happy with it…?"<br>
<br>
Chitose was wearing a big grin, and Mahiru was staring at her with a heartwarming<br>
<br>
smile of her own. As long as Chitose wasn't preoccupied playing pranks or getting up<br>
<br>
to some other kind of mischief, she was a pretty thoughtful girlfriend. Amane thought<br>
<br>
it was nice she had made something just for Itsuki.<br>
<br>
But she did tend to take things too far, so it could be a little dangerous to trust her<br>
<br>
completely.<br>
<br>
Amane also smiled a little at the beaming Mahiru, then turned his attention to the plate<br>
<br>
that had been set before him. He pressed his hands together. "All right, let's eat."<br>
<br>
"Go ahead! Enjoy your meal!"<br>
<br>
Chitose looked almost bashful. It was surprisingly endearing, and just for a moment,<br>
<br>
Amane was reminded that she was a girl, too, after all.<br>
<br>
"…Um, I'm sorry."<br>
<br>
After Chitose left, Mahiru suddenly apologized.<br>
<br>
Amane wasn't sure why she was apologizing, and he looked with wide eyes at Mahiru<br>
<br>
sitting beside him. She had her legs drawn in and was fidgeting restlessly, wearing a<br>
<br>
guilty expression.<br>
<br>
"…Sorry about the pranks."<br>
<br>
"Pranks?"<br>
<br>
"Chitose didn't do anything to you, but… well, I did."<br>
<br>
"Huh, you did?"<br>
<br>
He was certain Chitose had said she hadn't done anything when he interrogated her,<br>
<br>
and Mahiru had also confirmed that Chitose hadn't. But Mahiru hadn't said a single<br>
<br>
word about whether she herself had been up to no good.<br>
<br>
Amane had never even considered that Mahiru might do something to him and had<br>
<br>
automatically excluded her from suspicion, but apparently she had been busy.<br>
<br>
She looked guilty, like she wanted to run away at any moment.<br>
<br>
"What did you do?"<br>
<br>
"Well, I squished your cheeks…"<br>
<br>
"…Does that really qualify as a prank?"<br>
<br>
"A-and then I stared at your sleeping face, and I stroked your hair."<br>
<br>
"Well, you do like doing that."<br>
<br>
"…Y-yes."<br>
<br>
"So… was that all?"<br>
<br>
"…Yes."<br>
<br>
The way she was acting, she seemed remorseful, but Amane wanted to joke that those<br>
<br>
things were hardly pranks. What Mahiru had done was less of a prank and more like<br>
<br>
normal physical intimacy. If that was a prank, then that would mean Amane had also<br>
<br>
been messing with Mahiru, so he hoped she didn't think of it that way.<br>
<br>
"I'm not really mad, you know. Like, as long as you were having fun, I guess it's fine; it<br>
<br>
was just careless of me to fall asleep in front of other people."<br>
<br>
"Th-thank you…"<br>
<br>
"I mean, I don't think it would be much fun to look at this ugly mug, but…"<br>
<br>
"…You looked cute, you know?"<br>
<br>
"You're just about the only person who would say a guy like me looked cute."<br>
<br>
"That's not true. Chitose said so!"<br>
<br>
"She was definitely making fun of me…"<br>
<br>
In Chitose's case, she obviously said he looked cute because she thought it was funny.<br>
<br>
That was a different matter than Mahiru finding him cute. As a rule, nobody should<br>
<br>
ever take Chitose too seriously, he thought.<br>
<br>
"…You really were cute."<br>
<br>
"Really?"<br>
<br>
"I played with your cheeks a lot…"<br>
<br>
"I wonder, is it that much fun to poke at a guy's cheeks?"<br>
<br>
"It's more fun than you realize."<br>
<br>
Based on his own body, Amane thought guys' cheeks would be very stiff compared to<br>
<br>
girls' and therefore not that much fun to poke or play with. He didn't understand what<br>
<br>
Mahiru found so great about it, but if it was the very act of poking that she found<br>
<br>
enjoyable, then he supposed he shouldn't complain.<br>
<br>
"Well, it's not like I can't relate," he said. "Your cheeks also feel nice to poke at."<br>
<br>
He had played the same "prank" on Mahiru before.<br>
<br>
That said, it wouldn't do to touch her too boldly, so he cautiously, gently poked her<br>
<br>
with the tip of his finger.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's cheek was soft and a little squishy and undeniably feminine. She obviously<br>
<br>
took very good care of her skin, because it was smooth and lustrous. Just touching her<br>
<br>
like this felt amazing. Telling himself that if Mahiru had touched his face, he should be<br>
<br>
allowed to touch hers, Amane gently pinched her pliable cheek.<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked up at him with a bit of dissatisfaction, and he knew he'd better not<br>
<br>
overdo it, so he stroked the cheek gently with the pad of his finger to mollify her. He<br>
<br>
moved gently and carefully, just like he would if he were petting a kitten.<br>
<br>
"…Hmm."<br>
<br>
Before long, the look of dissatisfaction faded and was replaced by a soft smile that<br>
<br>
seemed to be hiding something. It was such a sweet expression, he wondered if the<br>
<br>
secret ingredient was plenty of honey.<br>
<br>
…She looks really relaxed.<br>
<br>
He was surprised to see how relaxed Mahiru looked while a boy touched her like that.<br>
<br>
Then it occurred to him that Mahiru never let boys touch her, and he suddenly felt very<br>
<br>
embarrassed to be receiving such special treatment. It made him want to bang his<br>
<br>
head on the back of the sofa.<br>
<br>
Trying to put such thoughts out of his mind, Amane reached his hand under Mahiru's<br>
<br>
chin, and this time he really moved his fingers like he was petting a cat.<br>
<br>
"Hyah!" She let out a small yelp. "…Wh-what was that?"<br>
<br>
"Practice for when we go to the cat cafe ."<br>
<br>
"What were you thinking? I'm not a cat, I'm a person!"<br>
<br>
"It's because you're so catlike. But also kind of like a dog and a bunny at the same time."<br>
<br>
"What are you talking about…?"<br>
<br>
"Exactly what I said."<br>
<br>
Recently, Amane had made the private observation that Mahiru at times acted like a<br>
<br>
cat, a dog, and even a rabbit. When he was first getting to know her, she had been a<br>
<br>
very wary cat, then as they became closer, she became friendly like a dog… not exactly<br>
<br>
the same, but she had definitely warmed up to him. As for the rabbit… for some reason,<br>
<br>
Amane had gotten it into his head that rabbits were lonely creatures, so he had just<br>
<br>
thrown that one in the mix for good measure.<br>
<br>
Amane was glad she didn't hate being doted on, since he wanted to do exactly that. As<br>
<br>
he scratched under her chin, Mahiru quietly said "The top of my head would be better,"<br>
<br>
so he obediently switched to stroking her head.<br>
<br>
He decided not to mention that, at times like this, she was more doglike.<br>
<br>
"…If I'm a cat and a dog and a bunny… In that case, Amane, you're a wolf."<br>
<br>
"Does that mean I attack girls…?"<br>
<br>
"N-no, I don't mean it like that! Wolves seem to care about their companions a lot. I've<br>
<br>
heard they do anything to protect their pack. Well, since their packs are usually formed<br>
<br>
of family members, I guess it's a little different, but I say that because you take really<br>
<br>
good care of the people in your circle."<br>
<br>
"…Well, I guess you've got me there."<br>
<br>
Amane's circle of friends was pretty small. Small enough that he could count the<br>
<br>
people he would call friends on two hands. But he always tried to do the best he could<br>
<br>
for those people and treat them well. If she was going to call that facet of him wolflike,<br>
<br>
then he wasn't going to argue.<br>
<br>
"B-besides… that's how I want you to be."<br>
<br>
"That's how you want me to be?"<br>
<br>
"…No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it. Um, also, your hair is fluffy, which is why<br>
<br>
you're like a wolf."<br>
<br>
"That's not a trait of wolves."<br>
<br>
Mahiru seemed like she had been about to say something different, but now she was<br>
<br>
stroking Amane's hair, so he didn't question her and just let her touch his hair as she<br>
<br>
pleased.<br>
<br>
It was the day after the cooking class, and Mahiru apparently had plans to hang out<br>
<br>
with Chitose again, so she departed after preparing Amane's lunch.<br>
<br>
Amane would have been perfectly capable of feeding himself without her help, but she<br>
<br>
went to all the trouble of cooking for him, so he wasn't about to complain.<br>
<br>
He saw her off as she left his apartment, looking somewhat restless, then sighed as he<br>
<br>
wondered how he should spend his free time.<br>
<br>
It was currently just past one thirty. Mahiru had gone out, and it wasn't a bad time for<br>
<br>
going out, but he didn't really feel like it since he had nothing in particular planned. If<br>
<br>
he'd had plans to hang out with someone, he could have probably summoned the<br>
<br>
willpower to leave the apartment, but if no one waiting for him, then he figured he<br>
<br>
didn't need to go to the trouble.<br>
<br>
That left him with the question of what to do with his day. There weren't that many<br>
<br>
ways he could kill time at home.<br>
<br>
His most frequent pastimes were games and comics, but he had cleared all the<br>
<br>
scenarios in his role-playing games and even finished all the speedruns, and it wasn't<br>
<br>
all that interesting to play party games by himself.<br>
<br>
So he was down to comics and novels, but Amane didn't typically keep a lot of books<br>
<br>
around, and he had already read the ones he had several times over and knew all the<br>
<br>
plots. Amane was a fast reader anyway, so he would probably breeze through a whole<br>
<br>
comic book series in an hour.<br>
<br>
Amane was at a loss for what else he could do. For the moment, he went into his<br>
<br>
bedroom and opened the textbook that was lying on his desk.<br>
<br>
Chitose would look so confused if she could see me now.<br>
<br>
Amane didn't have much to do, and they did have homework even during Golden Week.<br>
<br>
And after Golden Week, midterm exams were waiting for them. He actually enjoyed<br>
<br>
studying a fair bit, so he figured it might be a good way to spend his day if he didn't<br>
<br>
have any other ideas.<br>
<br>
One way or another, he had to get through their assigned homework, and he wanted<br>
<br>
to be able to enjoy tomorrow's outing without having it in the back of his mind the<br>
<br>
whole time. So he decided it was best to go ahead and get his academic obligations out<br>
<br>
of the way.<br>
<br>
Amane was naturally a serious student, and he pulled himself up to his desk,<br>
<br>
mechanical pencil in hand, to complete his schoolwork.<br>
<br>
When he next noticed the time again, it was already past six o'clock.<br>
<br>
Whenever Amane was seriously concentrating, he tended to tune everything else out.<br>
<br>
As he left his bedroom, rolling his shoulders around to loosen up his stiff body, he<br>
<br>
smiled at how the sunbeams that were filtering through the window had changed<br>
<br>
their angle bit by bit.<br>
<br>
He could see the kitchen as soon as he was out in the hallway, and sure enough, there<br>
<br>
was Mahiru in her apron. She hadn't been there the last time he'd left his room to take<br>
<br>
a break.<br>
<br>
Apparently, she had returned from her outing.<br>
<br>
He wasn't sure if it was a good thing that he had been so focused he hadn't even noticed<br>
<br>
the sound of the door unlocking in the entryway, but he knew it wasn't good that he<br>
<br>
hadn't come out to greet her.<br>
<br>
"Welcome back. Sorry I didn't greet you."<br>
<br>
"No, it's fine… I didn't call out to you, either. I thought you were probably busy with<br>
<br>
something in your room."<br>
<br>
"I was doing homework."<br>
<br>
He had made plenty of progress in the quiet apartment, but he might have been<br>
<br>
studying too long, because his body was awfully stiff. He regretted not changing his<br>
<br>
posture a little more often while reading.<br>
<br>
He did some light stretching while they talked, and Mahiru let out a small giggle.<br>
<br>
"You're very studious."<br>
<br>
"I'm the type who likes to get my work done ahead of time so I can enjoy myself."<br>
<br>
"I'm much the same. Though I prefer to do my studying intermittently."<br>
<br>
"You're even more serious about schoolwork than I am."<br>
<br>
Generally speaking, Amane was also the type to study on and off and steadily etch<br>
<br>
things into his memory by repetition, but he wasn't as scrupulous and methodical as<br>
<br>
Mahiru.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, he had learned over the last summer break that Itsuki would finish his<br>
<br>
work first and then really play around, while Chitose would play first and then drown<br>
<br>
in her own tears of regret, so he expected the latter half of summer vacation this year<br>
<br>
to be rough going.<br>
<br>
"Once you make a habit of it, it's really not that much trouble," Mahiru explained. "Once<br>
<br>
it becomes second nature, you don't think anything of it."<br>
<br>
"Impressive. I've got to put in some more work, until it becomes second nature."<br>
<br>
Most people assumed that Mahiru was some kind of prodigy, a genius blessed with a<br>
<br>
naturally brilliant mind. Those people didn't know how hard she worked. Amane<br>
<br>
would never deny that she was very smart, but he knew that, above all else, she was a<br>
<br>
hard worker first and foremost.<br>
<br>
She didn't show it much on the surface, but behind the scenes, she never failed to put<br>
<br>
in the effort. That was why her grades and her looks and her athletics were all<br>
<br>
outstanding.<br>
<br>
Amane knew how hard Mahiru worked, so he recognized and admired her efforts and<br>
<br>
didn't begrudge her successes. Mahiru's abilities were earned through being disciplined,<br>
<br>
and anyone who wanted the same for themselves would have to put in the same labor.<br>
<br>
Amane doubted he would ever be able to reach Mahiru's level, but as someone who<br>
<br>
always wanted to improve his grades, he admired her.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was frowning like something had tickled her. "Flattery will get you nowhere,<br>
<br>
mister. At best, you might get pudding after dinner."<br>
<br>
"Oh, then should I praise you more?"<br>
<br>
"How calculated."<br>
<br>
Mahiru smiled like something was funny. Amane gave her a sidelong glance, but when<br>
<br>
he opened the refrigerator, he realized there really was pudding inside. It was
<p></p>
store-bought, but it came from the patisserie that Chitose liked so much,
<p></p>
and it was one of Amane's favorites, too. Though Mahiru's handmade pudding was the best,<br>
<br>
this was also sure to be delicious. A surge of happiness bubbled up within him.<br>
<br>
Mahiru giggled when she saw Amane's face light up all of a sudden, so he came back<br>
<br>
to his senses and felt a bit embarrassed.<br>
<br>
"You really do love eggs, don't you?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, I do."<br>
<br>
There was no need to hide it in front of Mahiru, who already had a thorough<br>
<br>
knowledge of his culinary preferences, so he meekly nodded in agreement.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Mahiru froze in place, still stiffly holding a potato she had just finished<br>
<br>
washing. Amane tried to look at her face to see what was the matter, but she quickly<br>
<br>
turned away.<br>
<br>
"Mahiru?"<br>
<br>
"…It's nothing. More importantly, if you're not going to help, I recommend you leave<br>
<br>
the kitchen."<br>
<br>
"So harsh all of a sudden. I actually came in here intending to help, but…"<br>
<br>
Still, he wasn't going to make Mahiru do all the work alone. Besides, a little light<br>
<br>
activity would be just perfect for waking up his stiff limbs.<br>
<br>
Amane grabbed his apron from the kitchen rack and put it on. Mahiru wordlessly put<br>
<br>
several washed potatoes in a bowl and handed it to him along with a peeler. She didn't<br>
<br>
look him in the eye the whole time.<br>
<br>
"By the way, what are we going to make with these potatoes?"<br>
<br>
"…I was planning to make potato salad, but now they're going to be ingredients for a<br>
<br>
frittata."<br>
<br>
"Isn't that a pretty big change?"<br>
<br>
"It's fine. I'm in charge of the kitchen. You just need to follow what I say."<br>
<br>
"I—I don't really get it, but you make a good point."<br>
<br>
This was Amane's kitchen, but Mahiru was in charge of the cooking, so this kitchen<br>
<br>
was actually under Mahiru's control. After all, Amane didn't know nearly as much<br>
<br>
about culinary matters as she did, so he was better off obediently following her lead.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was obviously not in a good mood, and Amane wondered about her cold tone<br>
<br>
as he washed his hands and began to peel the potatoes. Fortunately, he didn't need to<br>
<br>
worry about injuring himself with a peeler.<br>
<br>
Mahiru, meanwhile, had started her own tasks. It seemed like the change in menu had<br>
<br>
been pretty sudden, but Mahiru knew what was in the refrigerator best anyway, so<br>
<br>
Amane was sure there was no problem.<br>
<br>
"…So what did you do today?"<br>
<br>
The kitchen was spacious enough that the two of them could work side by side, and<br>
<br>
he wouldn't have minded working in silence, but Amane's task wasn't that hard, so he<br>
<br>
tried to strike up a conversation.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's whole body twitched.<br>
<br>
"Eh… um, well… I—I got her advice on something, I guess."<br>
<br>
"Oh, was something giving you trouble? Did you sort it out?"<br>
<br>
Honestly, Amane hoped Mahiru would come to him if she ever had a problem. But<br>
<br>
there were probably a lot of issues only another girl would fully understand, so he<br>
<br>
wasn't about to complain or anything.<br>
<br>
"Y-yeah, sort of. I'll know for sure in a few days."<br>
<br>
"Hmm. That's good, then."<br>
<br>
If she had solved her problem, then Amane had nothing further to say, and he promptly<br>
<br>
shut his mouth, knowing it would be bad to pry.<br>
<br>
Mahiru tugged nervously at her apron.<br>
<br>
"…Amane?"<br>
<br>
"Hmm?"<br>
<br>
"Uh, um, Amane… Which style do you like better, simple and clean or more mature?"<br>
<br>
Her eyelashes fluttered as she peered at him with a troubling expression.<br>
<br>
He didn't ask why she was suddenly asking him such a question. He figured she must<br>
<br>
be trying to decide what kind of look was best for their outing tomorrow or something.<br>
<br>
"I think it's best when the style suits the person wearing it," he finally answered.<br>
<br>
"I'm asking about your preferences."<br>
<br>
"I don't know what to say. It's nice to see a woman in something that really suits her,<br>
<br>
but I think everyone should just wear what they feel comfortable in."<br>
<br>
"…I'm asking about your preferences."<br>
<br>
"Uh…"<br>
<br>
Amane really thought it was best for Mahiru to wear whatever she liked, but she didn't<br>
<br>
seem content to take that as his final answer.<br>
<br>
"I really think either style is fine. A simple look suits your personality and looks cute,<br>
<br>
and a sophisticated look brings out your beauty more. I think either one looks great<br>
<br>
on you. There's something to like about each of them, but I can't say which look I like<br>
<br>
better unless I see the actual outfits."<br>
<br>
"…Y-you really do just come out and say things like that pretty bluntly, don't you? Agh…"<br>
<br>
"I mean, you asked. Hmm, I guess go with the simple look."<br>
<br>
He was getting the feeling that she wanted him to come out and pick one, so he obliged.<br>
<br>
Mahiru turned away from him. "All right, I'll do that," she answered. "I'll do my best to<br>
<br>
put together a look that will astonish even the calm and collected Amane."<br>
<br>
"That seems like it won't end up being very simple…"<br>
<br>
"Fine, I'll wear something that will make you lose your mind."<br>
<br>
"Don't go too far; I won't know what to do."<br>
<br>
"That's what I'm hoping." 1<br>
<br>
Mahiru was being awfully forward today, but it was still adorable, just in a different<br>
<br>
way. Amane chuckled to himself and continued peeling potato skins.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 35: An Outing with the Angel<br>
<br>
"Good morning, Amane."<br>
<br>
Most people would start an outing by meeting up somewhere, but Mahiru met him at<br>
<br>
his apartment. Since she lived next door, they didn't need to go to the trouble of<br>
<br>
arranging a meeting place. Instead, Mahiru came directly to his door.<br>
<br>
She certainly did look different.<br>
<br>
"Morning… Oh, you put your hair up today."<br>
<br>
"I thought it would get in the way if we're going to be playing with cats. How do you<br>
<br>
like it?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru usually wore her long hair down, but today it was braided and gathered up in<br>
<br>
a bun. It looked like a more complex version of what she did with it when she was<br>
<br>
cooking.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, it looks good."<br>
<br>
"It's nice of you to say so, but… W-well… if you're going to laugh, just laugh, okay?"<br>
<br>
"What are you talking about?"<br>
<br>
"…You think it looks silly, don't you?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru was squeezing her arms tightly over her chest. Her outfit showed a little bit<br>
<br>
more skin than usual.<br>
<br>
Putting it that way might make it seem like she was wearing a very exposing outfit,<br>
<br>
but her top was a chiffon blouse with an open collar, and the pure-white skin of her<br>
<br>
neck was peeking out, which just gave the illusion of more exposure.<br>
<br>
The blouse had a long lantern sleeve with slits in the sides and lace panels that ran<br>
<br>
along the length so her upper arms were partially hidden but still showed through. It<br>
<br>
was subtly enticing.<br>
<br>
Of course, she had an undershirt on, so it wasn't like he was at risk of seeing anything<br>
<br>
if he looked at her from above, but somehow he found the look both tidy and alluring<br>
<br>
in the way it enhanced her femininity.<br>
<br>
On the bottom she was wearing skinny jeans, perhaps because she was preparing to<br>
<br>
play with cats at the cafe . The jeans fit tightly to her figure, hugging her slender legs.<br>
<br>
On her wrist she wore the flower bracelet Amane had given her as a present. He<br>
<br>
remembered her saying she was going to wear it with care, and he felt a warmth in his<br>
<br>
chest.<br>
<br>
"I don't think you look silly. In fact, I think you look even prettier than usual."<br>
<br>
"Well, don't you look the part today? Your parents must have raised you to be a proper<br>
<br>
gentleman."<br>
<br>
"Dad always told me that you ought to compliment a girl when she's all dressed up…<br>
<br>
Of course, it's not just flattery, you know."<br>
<br>
"…I'll believe you."<br>
<br>
Mahiru's face flushed slightly red, and she held her bag tight. Amane smiled wryly and<br>
<br>
almost patted her head, but he stopped himself. He expected she wouldn't be pleased<br>
<br>
if he messed up her elaborate hairdo before they even started their outing.<br>
<br>
Mahiru blinked like she'd been expecting it but seemed to understand he was being<br>
<br>
considerate of her hair, and so she smiled at him. She did give Amane's hand a bit of a<br>
<br>
wary look, though.<br>
<br>
"…Amane, recently you've been a little obsessed with patting my head, haven't you?"<br>
<br>
"If you don't like it, I'll stop. I know I shouldn't touch you too excessively."<br>
<br>
"N-no, that's not what I meant… I, um, I want to be able to play with your hair, too,<br>
<br>
when I want to."<br>
<br>
"That's fine; I don't mind, but you can't do it now. I've got wax in it."<br>
<br>
Amane had donned his "mystery man" outfit to go out with Mahiru, taking the time to<br>
<br>
carefully arrange his hair. His outfit choice was relaxed, consisting of a denim jacket<br>
<br>
over a white V-neck shirt plus some slim black trousers. It was obviously not as much<br>
<br>
effort as Mahiru had gone to, but Amane was used to looking like a slob next to her,<br>
<br>
and this time he'd at least tried.<br>
<br>
"…So I can touch your hair?"<br>
<br>
"I don't really mind, but for today, let's make do with petting cats."<br>
<br>
"I—I didn't mean I wanted to do it right now, you know. I can do it later, I guess…"<br>
<br>
"I've been doing it to you, so it's only natural that you should get a chance. Fair<br>
<br>
turnabout and all."<br>
<br>
He didn't particularly dislike it when Mahiru touched his hair… If anything, it felt really<br>
<br>
nice, and if Mahiru enjoyed it, he was happy to let her continue. Mahiru had seemed<br>
<br>
flustered at first by Amane agreeing so easily, but now she was finally wearing a happy<br>
<br>
smile.<br>
<br>
"…Okay, then we're agreed: I'll do it later. For now, let's go pet lots of cats."<br>
<br>
"Sure."<br>
<br>
"Off we go, then?"<br>
<br>
"Mm."<br>
<br>
Thinking that setting out together from the same apartment felt a little embarrassing<br>
<br>
somehow, Amane left his place with Mahiru.<br>
<br>
As they walked side by side, the thought occurred to Amane to extend his hand to her.<br>
<br>
"Here, have a hand," he said lightheartedly.<br>
<br>
Mahiru flushed faintly and smiled as she squeezed his hand.<br>
<br>
He had done a degree of preliminary investigation, but when they actually entered the<br>
<br>
cat cafe , it was much more spacious than Amane had imagined.<br>
<br>
After the two had signed in and used hand sanitizer, they stepped into the main cafe<br>
<br>
area. As expected, they could see cats everywhere, walking around or curled into balls<br>
<br>
or playing with other patrons.<br>
<br>
"Wow… It's pretty big. And clean."<br>
<br>
The cafe offered food and drinks, so perhaps it was to be expected, but the cleanliness<br>
<br>
of the place still surprised him. He could barely smell any of the scents characteristic<br>
<br>
of many places where animals made their home. In fact, it was nearly odorless.<br>
<br>
He had looked at the reviews online, and this seemed to be a cat cafe that was prized<br>
<br>
for its hygiene and took good care of its cats. It was a popular place, but to keep the<br>
<br>
cats from getting stressed, it had only a few seats. There were also many hideouts for<br>
<br>
the cats, and in the end, the cafe seemed to be set up less for touching the cats than for<br>
<br>
sharing the space with them.<br>
<br>
This cafe had a time-limit system, and the fees were high, but it was such a beautiful<br>
<br>
and calm space that he didn't mind paying at all.<br>
<br>
"Whoa… cats… Look, Amane, they're all so cute!"<br>
<br>
There were cats with the other customers, so Mahiru spoke in a quiet voice, but he<br>
<br>
could hear her eager excitement as she tugged on his sleeve. There were all sorts of<br>
<br>
cats around, and Mahiru's eyes sparkled as she looked at them eagerly.<br>
<br>
The topic of animals had never really come up, but apparently she really liked cats.<br>
<br>
She was so excited, Amane could feel his mouth curling into a smile.<br>
<br>
"You're right; they're really cute."<br>
<br>
"So cute!" Mahiru didn't seem to realize how cute she was being herself as she looked<br>
<br>
at the profile chart she had received from the receptionist, listing the cats' names and<br>
<br>
breeds along with photos. She pointed to the Siamese cat beside her. "Ah, that one's<br>
<br>
name is Silky!"<br>
<br>
Only the fur on its tail and around its face was black, while the rest of the coat on its<br>
<br>
long, slender body was a dazzling white. It had characteristic blue eyes and exuded an<br>
<br>
air of nobility.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was itching to pet it, but suddenly touching the cats was prohibited, so she<br>
<br>
kept an eye on it from the side as she slowly brought her fingers closer to its nose and<br>
<br>
let it sniff her.<br>
<br>
The cat's nose twitched.<br>
<br>
She didn't say it out loud, but Mahiru clearly thought even that was cute, so she<br>
<br>
definitely seemed to like cats a lot.<br>
<br>
But after getting a full sniff of Mahiru's scent, Silky abruptly and gracefully dashed<br>
<br>
away.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was clearly disheartened.<br>
<br>
"That doesn't necessarily mean she hates you; I think she was just done saying hello."<br>
<br>
"R-right, I suppose that's fair…"<br>
<br>
"Come on, I think we should let the cats take their time and get used to us. Let's go<br>
<br>
have a seat for now, okay?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru stood back up, he took her hand, and they sat down on an open sofa. Once there,<br>
<br>
Amane finally took a slow look around the whole room and saw that there certainly<br>
<br>
were a lot of types of cats.<br>
<br>
The cat from a moment ago had been a Siamese, but there were American shorthairs,<br>
<br>
Russian blues, munchkins, Bengals, and even more exotic breeds—cats with great<br>
<br>
individuality here, there, and everywhere.<br>
<br>
At the next seat over, a short distance from them, an American shorthair was curled<br>
<br>
up on the table, and the girl sitting there was gently stroking it.<br>
<br>
"So cute…"<br>
<br>
Mahiru was looking at the other customers without bothering to disguise the envy in<br>
<br>
her eyes. Amane smiled wryly and looked over the menu.<br>
<br>
The food and drink offerings at this cafe were supposed to be delicious.<br>
<br>
The top recommendation seemed to be a latte with a cat design on top, formed out of<br>
<br>
the milk foam. Apparently, the staff was talented at making latte art, and many people<br>
<br>
had uploaded pictures.<br>
<br>
Amane left Mahiru to her own devices for a moment, as she was staring at a cat<br>
<br>
loitering nearby, and he called the waiter over and ordered the signature latte art.<br>
<br>
"I went ahead and ordered you the same thing as me, is that all right?" he asked when<br>
<br>
he had finished.<br>
<br>
"Huh? Ah yes, that's fine."<br>
<br>
As expected, Mahiru was so preoccupied with the cats that she hadn't even noticed<br>
<br>
him ordering. Mahiru was the type who could drink coffee or tea, so since this was a<br>
<br>
special outing, he decided to keep the order a secret and give her a little surprise.<br>
<br>
After a short while, their order was brought over. Slowly, so as not to destroy the latte<br>
<br>
art, their smiling waiter set the cups down on the table, bowed, and left. Mahiru<br>
<br>
couldn't take her eyes off the latte art atop her cup.<br>
<br>
"Is this okay?"<br>
<br>
"Y-yes, it's super cute…"<br>
<br>
"I'm glad."<br>
<br>
On Mahiru's drink, the milk foam had been poured with great care to form a cat that<br>
<br>
was curled up asleep, its coat pattern and expression drawn with cocoa powder. In<br>
<br>
Amane's cup, they had drawn a cat leaning against the rim. The cute, dainty depictions<br>
<br>
of the cats made it easy to understand why the cafe had become so popular.<br>
<br>
Perhaps to preserve the excitement, Mahiru was taking photos with her smartphone<br>
<br>
and looking quite pleased, but then for some reason her expression turned. "It's so<br>
<br>
cute I can't drink it…," she muttered.<br>
<br>
She sounded so serious. Amane couldn't help but laugh.<br>
<br>
"D-don't laugh at me, please."<br>
<br>
"It's just—you're so troubled over something so adorable."<br>
<br>
"B-but… it would be such a waste to destroy it when there's such a cute little cat…"<br>
<br>
"But it would be even more of a waste not to drink it."<br>
<br>
"Oh no."<br>
<br>
It wasn't that he didn't understand Mahiru's feelings, but the foam would collapse<br>
<br>
anyway even if she left it alone, and he presumed that the person who made the coffee<br>
<br>
would probably be happier if she drank it before it got cold.<br>
<br>
After sufficiently appreciating his own latte cat, Amane raised his cup without<br>
<br>
hesitation. He almost laughed again when he heard a murmur of sadness from beside<br>
<br>
him, but somehow he contained it enough to slowly sip his caffe latte.<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked so downhearted that he tried his best to drink without disturbing the<br>
<br>
cat too much. The latte itself was delicious. The combination of the deep coffee flavor<br>
<br>
and the rich milk was just perfect. And it wasn't too sweet, so Amane, who drank his<br>
<br>
coffee black, didn't mind it.<br>
<br>
"Mm, it's good."<br>
<br>
When he took a break from drinking and made this comment, Mahiru groaned slightly<br>
<br>
but brought her cup to her lips with some hesitation.<br>
<br>
She looked funny and cute drinking her latte and carefully trying to not destroy the<br>
<br>
cat, and Amane's lips must have curled into an unintentional smile.<br>
<br>
"I—I feel like you're laughing at me, but—"<br>
<br>
"You're imagining things. Is it good?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, it is, of course."<br>
<br>
When Amane looked at Mahiru once she had pulled her mouth away from the cup and<br>
<br>
set it back down, he couldn't control himself, and his shoulders shook with laughter.<br>
<br>
"Wh-why are you laughing?"<br>
<br>
"Well, you have a white moustache."<br>
<br>
She must have failed to pay attention to the rest of the milk foam in her efforts to keep<br>
<br>
the cat intact, for Mahiru's upper lip was now decorated with a white moustache<br>
<br>
reminiscent of Santa Claus.<br>
<br>
She looked so extremely cute that he instinctively snapped a photo with his phone.<br>
<br>
"Uh, d-did you just take a picture?!"<br>
<br>
"Sorry. Do you want me to delete it?"<br>
<br>
"W-were you planning on keeping a record of such a shameful face?"<br>
<br>
"You looked cute, so I just took it."<br>
<br>
When he said that, Mahiru pressed her lips together tightly, and her face flushed red.<br>
<br>
In a quiet voice, she grumbled, "…You can have the one photo."<br>
<br>
She was still wearing the white moustache as she told him that, so Amane felt his chest<br>
<br>
growing warm as he held back a laugh and nodded in agreement.<br>
<br>
"…Ah!"<br>
<br>
Around the time they finished drinking their caffe lattes decorated with foam art, one<br>
<br>
of the cats jumped up on Amane's lap.<br>
<br>
It was the American shorthair that had been at the neighboring seat earlier.<br>
<br>
After checking out the profile sheet, they saw that it said CACAO, FEMALE.<br>
<br>
Amane wasn't sure whether she was friendly or just shameless, but she had suddenly<br>
<br>
gotten up on his lap, which he found perplexing. He was fully aware that cats did as<br>
<br>
they pleased, but he was slightly unsettled to be approached so suddenly.<br>
<br>
The warmth in his lap was more profound than he had expected, as the cat confidently<br>
<br>
curled up and settled in as if to say this was her spot.<br>
<br>
"This one is really friendly."<br>
<br>
He looked over at Mahiru as the cat sniffed at his fingers and thought she seemed<br>
<br>
incredibly jealous.<br>
<br>
Once Cacao had finished sniffing to her heart's content, she nuzzled her face into<br>
<br>
Amane's palm, so he figured she was asking him to pet her and started scratching her<br>
<br>
under her chin like he had practiced on Mahiru.<br>
<br>
He could tell from the vibration and the sound that she was purring.<br>
<br>
Feeling relaxed by the presence of the cute cat, Amane ruffled the fur under her chin<br>
<br>
as he petted her, but he felt jealous eyes on him from Mahiru sitting next to him and<br>
<br>
chuckled to himself again.<br>
<br>
"Mahiru, put out your hand."<br>
<br>
"Huh? R-right."<br>
<br>
She obediently stretched out her hand, so Amane removed his own hand from Cacao<br>
<br>
and, in its place, put Mahiru's palm near Cacao's face.<br>
<br>
This cat is probably friendly and used to humans, so she ought to allow herself to be<br>
<br>
petted after a proper greeting.<br>
<br>
Cacao sniffed at Mahiru's hand, then let out a somewhat listless meeeow and rubbed<br>
<br>
her face against Mahiru's palm. Mahiru's eyes sparkled, overcome with emotion.<br>
<br>
"Amane, she let me pet her!"<br>
<br>
Mahiru smiled gleefully at Amane as she finally got to pet a cat, stroking the fur in the<br>
<br>
right direction.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a sign of how carefully the cats were looked after, Cacao's fur was shiny and<br>
<br>
incredibly soft. She didn't smell bad, either, and had just a faint hint of cat odor. She<br>
<br>
was obviously treasured dearly by the staff.<br>
<br>
All the cats had nice coats and looked healthy, and there weren't any that were<br>
<br>
extremely fat or too thin. And all the lively cats were free to move about as they pleased.<br>
<br>
"…So cute."<br>
<br>
"They really are, aren't they?… I'm jealous of you, Amane…"<br>
<br>
"How about you call Cacao over to you? Tell her to come sit in your lap."<br>
<br>
The cats couldn't understand words, but gestures seemed to communicate surprisingly<br>
<br>
well.<br>
<br>
As a test, Mahiru patted her lap and called "Come here," and Cacao meowed once, then<br>
<br>
slowly moved over to sit on the offered spot.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's expression of excitement at that moment was so full of joy that just seeing it<br>
<br>
was enough to make Amane happy, too.<br>
<br>
"Look, she sat on me!"<br>
<br>
"That's great. Hey, she wants you to pet her."<br>
<br>
Cacao must have preferred Mahiru's soft lap over Amane's hard one, for she meowed<br>
<br>
even louder than before and pushed her face into Mahiru's palm.<br>
<br>
Smiling at the beaming Mahiru, who was rubbing the cat to her heart's content, Amane<br>
<br>
captured the moment with his smartphone.<br>
<br>
"Is this photo all right?"<br>
<br>
"…This one's okay," Mahiru said as she stroked Cacao.<br>
<br>
Amane kept smiling at her and stood up.<br>
<br>
Along the wall were bookshelves filled with magazines and comics, so he intended to<br>
<br>
bring several of them back to the table.<br>
<br>
This place was called a cat cafe , but that didn't mean one would constantly be playing<br>
<br>
with cats. His main goal was to spend a comfortable time in a space where there were<br>
<br>
cats around, so relaxing with some reading material was also an option.<br>
<br>
While Mahiru was absorbed in petting Cacao, Amane chose something to read from<br>
<br>
the shelves without much thought. That was when he noticed that Silky, the cat that<br>
<br>
had greeted Mahiru when they first came in, was at his feet.<br>
<br>
He crouched down and put his index finger near her nose, and as expected, she sniffed<br>
<br>
him in greeting.<br>
<br>
This gesture was quite adorable, so his cheeks softened into another smile as he<br>
<br>
watched her fondly. When she was done smelling him, Silky lifted a front paw and<br>
<br>
leaned against him, as if she was going to leap into his arms.<br>
<br>
Silky meowed in a higher pitch than Cacao and touched him again, so Amane sat crosslegged on the floor.<br>
<br>
The cat had a high-class aura but seemed to be comfortable around people, and she<br>
<br>
was allowing him to pet her. When he tried stroking her, she put on a very satisfied<br>
<br>
expression.<br>
<br>
She was purring and nuzzling him, so he took that as a sign that she wanted him to pet<br>
<br>
her more. In accordance with the wishes of the noble Lady Silky, he gently and carefully<br>
<br>
stroked her back.<br>
<br>
There was a cat at Itsuki's house, so he understood how to do the petting. He watched<br>
<br>
Silky carefully and adjusted his motions to keep her happy and docile.<br>
<br>
So cute…<br>
<br>
He could feel her purring, and another gentle smile soon slipped onto his lips. At first,<br>
<br>
she had behaved a bit coldly, so he hadn't expected her to be so permissive and fawning.<br>
<br>
Now that I think about it, she's kind of like Mahiru.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had also been cold and standoffish at first, but once she let her guard down,<br>
<br>
she started gazing at him with trust in her eyes, fawning over him, and getting<br>
<br>
comfortable. In that way, she had reminded him of a cat.<br>
<br>
Inwardly bestowing Silky with the moniker Angel Two, Amane enjoyed petting her.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, he heard the sound of a camera shutter. He looked up and saw that Mahiru<br>
<br>
had approached without him noticing and taken a picture with her smartphone.<br>
<br>
"I thought you were taking a while… So you made friends with Silky, huh?"<br>
<br>
"I don't know why, but she came over to see me."<br>
<br>
"You're so stingy… I want to pet her, too…"<br>
<br>
"What happened to Cacao?"<br>
<br>
"Cats have a mind of their own…"<br>
<br>
Apparently, the cat had gone off somewhere.<br>
<br>
He looked around the cafe and saw Cacao curled up on the second story of a cat tower.<br>
<br>
Just a moment ago, she had been sitting with Mahiru, but she must have changed her<br>
<br>
mind.<br>
<br>
"Is Silky your favorite, Amane?"<br>
<br>
"Well, I haven't petted all of them yet to really start comparing… But yeah, she kind of<br>
<br>
resembles you, so I'd like to keep petting her."<br>
<br>
"Resembles me?"<br>
<br>
"I mean, you were pretty standoffish at first, kind of cold and blunt, but once you<br>
<br>
decided you liked me, you warmed up quickly."<br>
<br>
Sure, it was catlike for her to let her guard down and fawn on him, but he thought that<br>
<br>
the way she trusted him and relished his attention was more doglike, so he thought of<br>
<br>
her as a cross between a cat and dog.<br>
<br>
Mahiru didn't seem to realize just how badly she was spoiling him, which made Amane<br>
<br>
feel happy yet embarrassed at the same time.<br>
<br>
"…I am not a cat. Besides, it's not like I get attached to just anyone."<br>
<br>
"Well, that's because you're very wary."<br>
<br>
"…You haven't been thinking of me as a cat?"<br>
<br>
"I haven't, I haven't," he answered, stroking the cat in his lap the same way he always<br>
<br>
patted Mahiru. "Right?" he sought Silky's agreement.<br>
<br>
Either she was good at reading the room, or it was just a coincidence, but Silky<br>
<br>
meowed, right on cue so even Mahiru couldn't press the matter any further.<br>
<br>
But Mahiru looked at him with a fairly dissatisfied expression, so Amane used his<br>
<br>
unoccupied left hand to stroke Mahiru's head.<br>
<br>
"…So you do think of me as a cat."<br>
<br>
"Sort of. Here, how about you play with Silky? It looks like they'll lend you some toys<br>
<br>
if you go to the front desk."<br>
<br>
"You're not getting out of this that easily."<br>
<br>
"…So you don't want to play with her, then?" he asked as he teased the cat.<br>
<br>
Mahiru pouted slightly and grumbled "You don't play fair, Amane," then headed for the<br>
<br>
front desk to borrow some cat toys.<br>
<br>
Amane had been planning to switch places with her and go to the desk himself, so he<br>
<br>
watched her with wide eyes, then tilted his head in confusion as he recalled Mahiru's<br>
<br>
expression, which had been a little sulky for some reason.<br>
<br>
"What does that mean, I don't play fair?… Is she talking about playing with Silky?" He<br>
<br>
muttered as he pondered the reason for Mahiru's sour expression, but the cat just<br>
<br>
meowed as if to say "How should I know?" and nestled its head in his palm again.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, the reason for Mahiru's pouting wasn't really clear, but as she played with<br>
<br>
the cats, her mood quickly improved, and she was soon smiling at him again.<br>
<br>
After a certain point, Mahiru stopped paying attention to Amane and focused entirely<br>
<br>
on the cats. He smiled wryly as he watched her play, but for some reason, the cats kept<br>
<br>
settling into Amane's lap.<br>
<br>
Mahiru saw this and started sulking again, but Silky, as if to say "There's no helping it,"<br>
<br>
moved over to sit on Mahiru's thighs, and all was well again.<br>
<br>
There must have been something about Amane that the cats appreciated, because as<br>
<br>
he was petting them, even though he had no treats to give, other cats continued to<br>
<br>
swarm around him.<br>
<br>
Eventually, though, they reached the end of their allotted time in the cafe . The two of<br>
<br>
them used lint rollers to remove cat hair from their clothes and washed their hands,<br>
<br>
and as Amane finished, Mahiru went to get the bill, then looked at him with<br>
<br>
dissatisfaction.<br>
<br>
"Why are you making that face?" he asked.<br>
<br>
"You didn't have to go to the trouble of doing that."<br>
<br>
"It's no trouble. It's for my own satisfaction, so don't worry about it." Amane had gone<br>
<br>
ahead and paid for everything already, so she didn't have to. "Actually, think of it as my<br>
<br>
way of saying thanks for coming with me to a cat cafe , a place I never would have gone<br>
<br>
into alone. Okay?"<br>
<br>
"…But—"<br>
<br>
"Let me treat you in situations like this. If you don't agree, then… All right, how about<br>
<br>
coming with me again to make it even?"<br>
<br>
"…I can't do anything but agree to that, can I?"<br>
<br>
"Well, I'm for this plan, too, so it's a win-win. No problem!"<br>
<br>
Mahiru pressed her lips together tightly and nudged Amane's upper arm, then<br>
<br>
squeezed Amane's hand again.<br>
<br>
Amane and Mahiru had lunch at a restaurant they had picked out in advance, one with<br>
<br>
a good reputation, before heading to the shopping mall. It was a popular restaurant,<br>
<br>
and as expected, the food was tasty, just like the reviews reported. Perhaps it was a<br>
<br>
simple matter of opinion, but Amane still thought Mahiru's cooking edged out ahead,<br>
<br>
confirming once more that hers was the very best.<br>
<br>
Seeing as how it was Golden Week, there were quite a few more customers in the mall<br>
<br>
than there might have been on a typical weekday, so gripping tightly onto Mahiru's<br>
<br>
hand, Amane stopped beside a wall so they could figure out where they wanted to go<br>
<br>
before diving into the crowds.<br>
<br>
"So then, what will we do in the mall? You mentioned shopping, but is there something<br>
<br>
in particular you want to buy?"<br>
<br>
"N-nothing specific, but um, I thought it sounded fun to have a look around together…<br>
<br>
I-is that all right?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, that's fine. I'm good with window-shopping."<br>
<br>
At home, he had often been dragged around by his mother, and his family would also<br>
<br>
sometimes go out shopping, so he had built up a tolerance to an activity that some<br>
<br>
found fairly agonizing.<br>
<br>
Besides, it wouldn't be a bad idea to get a look at some things that Mahiru wanted to<br>
<br>
see.<br>
<br>
"Where do you want to start? There are all sorts of shops—variety goods, clothes,<br>
<br>
interior decorating…"<br>
<br>
This enormous shopping complex had an almost uncountable number of clothing and<br>
<br>
accessory stores, restaurants, variety shops, and entertainment facilities all crammed<br>
<br>
in wall-to-wall; so many stores over such a wide area that they couldn't possibly see it<br>
<br>
all in one day. Since it would be impossible to look around the entire mall, he had to<br>
<br>
get her to provide at least some direction.<br>
<br>
"All right… Can we start with clothes?"<br>
<br>
"Sure. You buying a new outfit?"<br>
<br>
"I want to buy something, if there's anything good. They've got this summer's styles<br>
<br>
out, so I'd like to get some new clothes."<br>
<br>
"Summer, huh…? That came quickly."<br>
<br>
The sweaty season was about to start, but even so, it was still the time of year when<br>
<br>
the sunlight was warm and cheerful, so he thought it was a bit hasty to switch over to<br>
<br>
summer clothes just yet. The stores, of course, had to anticipate the approaching<br>
<br>
season, but still, Amane couldn't shake the springtime feeling.<br>
<br>
"This summer… Uh, you'll be coming home with me… will you?"<br>
<br>
"Ah y-yes. If it's all right with you and your parents, that is." She seemed to remember<br>
<br>
the earlier conversation about coming with him to his parents' home the next time he<br>
<br>
went, and she nodded eagerly.<br>
<br>
"I asked my mom once more after we talked, and she said you're definitely welcome.<br>
<br>
Actually, she insisted I bring you."<br>
<br>
His parents would probably agree to let her stay even if he didn't check with them first,<br>
<br>
but they would have to get a room ready and everything, so he had made sure to ask<br>
<br>
ahead, and they'd promised to give her a warm welcome.<br>
<br>
He was certain to hear complaints from his mother if he showed up without her, so he<br>
<br>
was grateful for Mahiru's enthusiasm.<br>
<br>
"Well, my hometown's not that impressive, you know. Although, I guess there's plenty<br>
<br>
to do."<br>
<br>
"Really?"<br>
<br>
"Well, my mother never had trouble finding a new place to drag me. There's a shopping<br>
<br>
mall like this one, a ridiculously huge wilderness park, a stupidly large water park, just<br>
<br>
general stuff like that."<br>
<br>
Amane's hometown was in a nice, central location, not too urban and not too rural, so<br>
<br>
it was a place where people wouldn't get bored in the summer or winter. Far from it,<br>
<br>
there were so many things to do that it was a distinct danger to be dragged around<br>
<br>
from place to place and not have any time to be alone.<br>
<br>
The water park would be open in the summer, so it would feel really nice to go on the<br>
<br>
slides and swim around and relax. There was also a large water park in the area where<br>
<br>
they were living now, so they could probably also go swim there right after the start<br>
<br>
of summer vacation.<br>
<br>
Amane wasn't especially good at sports, but he didn't have anything against being<br>
<br>
active. He liked to swim, so it would probably be nice to go by himself, too. There was<br>
<br>
no way that he could tell Mahiru he'd like to go to the pool with her, because the<br>
<br>
invitation would sound too much like he had an obvious ulterior motive.<br>
<br>
"Swimming is optional at our school, so if you don't take it, you don't get the chance to<br>
<br>
swim, so it might be nice to go swimming. If you want to, you could go with my mom…<br>
<br>
Mahiru?"<br>
<br>
"Uh, no, it's nothing…"<br>
<br>
"Ah, don't worry. I'm not thinking that I want to see you in a swimsuit or anything rude<br>
<br>
like that."<br>
<br>
"I d-didn't think you were. A p-pool, huh?"<br>
<br>
"Is there something wrong with that?"<br>
<br>
Amane always thought of swimming pools in the summertime, and not in a weird way<br>
<br>
or anything, but Mahiru shook her head with slightly stiff movements.<br>
<br>
"W-well… umm…"<br>
<br>
"Hmm?"<br>
<br>
"A-as long as I don't have to swim, um… I could consider going…"<br>
<br>
"…Is it possible that you don't know how to swim?"<br>
<br>
She blatantly refused to meet his eyes. Apparently, he had been right on the money.<br>
<br>
"…I honestly thought you could do literally anything."<br>
<br>
"O-of course I can't do everything. Swimming is optional, so I thought I could get by<br>
<br>
without telling anyone."<br>
<br>
Her face was turning redder by the second. She was obviously embarrassed.<br>
<br>
"I don't know what to say; I didn't expect that…"<br>
<br>
"Th-that's enough about swimming already, isn't it? Come on, let's go."<br>
<br>
Mahiru didn't seem to want him to dwell on the fact that she couldn't swim, and with<br>
<br>
a very red face, she tugged at his hand. Well, not exactly tugged—she pressed her body<br>
<br>
against his arm and squeezed it tightly. It was clear she was trying to push him to get<br>
<br>
started with their window-shopping because she wanted to avoid the topic, but she<br>
<br>
couldn't find any traction.<br>
<br>
All the fabric on the clothes in the shops was more lightweight, to match the changing<br>
<br>
seasons as the weather gradually got warmer. The chiffon blouse Mahiru had on that<br>
<br>
day, for example, was very light and thin, and it had a wide collar, exposing much of<br>
<br>
her neck and shoulders. And Amane discovered at this moment that he was at just the<br>
<br>
right angle to see directly down the front of her undershirt.<br>
<br>
But he had a feeling that if he pointed that out right now, she would run away in a huff,<br>
<br>
so instead he kept his mouth shut and gently extracted his arm from Mahiru's grasp,<br>
<br>
then firmly took her by the hand.<br>
<br>
Frankly, he wouldn't have minded being able to enjoy the view for a little while longer,<br>
<br>
but his feelings of guilt took over and internally he derided himself for being a<br>
<br>
spineless loser. 1<br>
<br>
"I hear you, I hear you. Don't run; you'll fall."<br>
<br>
"…I'm not a child."<br>
<br>
Mahiru thankfully turned away, apparently unaware of Amane's agitation, and Amane,<br>
<br>
too, turned to look outside, hoping to escape her gaze for a bit.<br>
<br>
Desperately trying to drive the lingering feeling of that softness pressing up against<br>
<br>
his arm out of his mind, Amane sighed quietly enough that Mahiru couldn't hear.<br>
<br>
Amane gazed down the long row of shops as Mahiru tugged him along by the hand,<br>
<br>
but once again, all he could think about was how much attention she attracted.<br>
<br>
She possessed a simple and clean beauty that befitted her nickname of "the angel." But<br>
<br>
right now, Mahiru was exuding an aura of carefree joy that made him want to wrap his<br>
<br>
arms around her.<br>
<br>
In angel mode, Mahiru had the beauty and ephemerality of a painting and made<br>
<br>
onlookers feel like she must not be touched or interfered with. However, that was a<br>
<br>
fragile, artificial kind of beauty, and Amane knew it wasn't who she really was. The girl<br>
<br>
holding his hand was wearing a genuine, carefree smile and brimming with life.<br>
<br>
Without her even saying a word, he could tell from her expression and the way she<br>
<br>
held his hand, and even the way she walked, that she was having a lot of fun.<br>
<br>
Her usual restrained smile was beautiful, too, but he thought she looked much cuter<br>
<br>
when she let her feelings show on her face and smiled with her whole being, rather<br>
<br>
than keeping it all bottled up.<br>
<br>
"…Is something the matter?" she suddenly asked.<br>
<br>
"No," he answered. "I was just thinking that we get a lot of stares when we're walking<br>
<br>
together."<br>
<br>
Both men and women were turning to look at them as they passed, which really drove<br>
<br>
home the reality of Mahiru's beauty.<br>
<br>
"…I don't think I'm the only one they're looking at, you know?"<br>
<br>
"Well, I'm sure some of them are taking the time to size up the guy escorting you."<br>
<br>
"That's not what I mean, geez!"<br>
<br>
She looked up at him with disappointment but didn't seem inclined to elaborate, only<br>
<br>
squeezing his hand tightly again. He heard her mumble quietly, "His self-esteem is a<br>
<br>
real problem…"<br>
<br>
But Amane knew that if he was with Mahiru, he would be under strict scrutiny, and it<br>
<br>
was also obvious that he could never compare favorably to her, so this wasn't really an<br>
<br>
issue of self-esteem or anything like that, as far as he was concerned.<br>
<br>
"All right, listen up," Mahiru said. "I'll try to say this as frankly as possible so you can<br>
<br>
understand."<br>
<br>
"Huh? What's with that voice? Scary."<br>
<br>
"How rude…" She pressed on his nose with her index finger and silenced him. "This is<br>
<br>
your own fault, you know?"<br>
<br>
But instead of pouting, Mahiru wore a teasing smile as she repeatedly poked at<br>
<br>
Amane's nose, then pulled away once satisfied and tugged on Amane's hand. Actually,<br>
<br>
it would be more accurate to say she pressed up against his arm again.<br>
<br>
"…Things would move along a lot faster if you just had a little confidence," Mahiru<br>
<br>
grumbled, putting her forehead against his upper arm.<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't stand it. He had to look away.<br>
<br>
…It's not on purpose; she doesn't mean it.<br>
<br>
Amane was trying not to think about the softness pressed up against him. He tried to<br>
<br>
politely open up some distance between them, but Mahiru clutched his arm as if to tell<br>
<br>
him not to go anywhere.<br>
<br>
He shuddered, thinking that if this was all intentional, she was acting like quite the<br>
<br>
little devil. But he was convinced she wasn't aware of what she was doing, so he<br>
<br>
shuddered for a different reason.<br>
<br>
If things continued this way, he was going to blow his top, so Amane somehow turned<br>
<br>
his conscious mind to other things and took an easy look around at the area. Exactly<br>
<br>
when he needed it, he spotted a store lined with racks of understated clothes that<br>
<br>
Mahiru might like.<br>
<br>
"Hey, the clothes on that mannequin seem like they would suit you. Want to go take a<br>
<br>
look?"<br>
<br>
He pointed out the shop with his free hand, hoping to divert attention from the fire<br>
<br>
currently searing his cheeks, and Mahiru asked, "Are those the sorts of clothes you like,<br>
<br>
Amane?" She seemed interested, so their feet naturally led them toward the shop.<br>
<br>
"How about this one?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, well, you look good in everything, but something like this does seems like it<br>
<br>
would suit you in particular."<br>
<br>
The mannequin was dressed in an off-the-shoulder dress with thin stripes on a white<br>
<br>
field. It was summer clothing, so the fabric was fairly thin, and the shoulders were<br>
<br>
exposed. It looked cool and comfortable for warm-weather outings.<br>
<br>
This style of clothing looked really good on women who were slender and had pretty<br>
<br>
de colletage, so he was sure it would look great on Mahiru. He mentally dressed her in<br>
<br>
the outfit as she stood there next to the mannequin and was immediately able to<br>
<br>
imagine her looking light and breezy in it. It was a look that would go well with a straw<br>
<br>
hat.<br>
<br>
"I'll just go try it on, okay?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru picked up one of the same from a rack of dresses hanging next to the<br>
<br>
mannequin, as if she had either decided quickly or had always been planning to try it<br>
<br>
on.<br>
<br>
Amane was a bit taken aback by her sudden enthusiasm. He accepted the bag she<br>
<br>
entrusted to him, and she immediately disappeared into the fitting room.<br>
<br>
He waited for Mahiru to change clothes, baffled by her excitement, and ended up even<br>
<br>
more baffled because for some reason he kept finding himself on the receiving end of<br>
<br>
warm looks from people nearby. It wasn't just the store clerk—the other customers<br>
<br>
were smiling at him pleasantly, which made Amane extremely uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
As he waited for Mahiru, he wished from the bottom of his heart that she would return<br>
<br>
soon. Finally, the fitting room curtain opened, and Mahiru stepped out.<br>
<br>
But she hadn't changed into the dress.<br>
<br>
"Welcome back… You didn't put it on?"<br>
<br>
"No, I put it on and checked the size. But… Well, I can't show it to you right now,<br>
<br>
because I don't have on the right underwear…"<br>
<br>
"S-sorry I asked."<br>
<br>
The chiffon blouse she was currently wearing also showed a fair amount of cleavage,<br>
<br>
but not as much as an off-the-shoulder dress. It sounded like she needed to have on<br>
<br>
different underthings than usual when wearing clothes that exposed so much<br>
<br>
shoulder, so she wasn't ready to immediately show him the dress.<br>
<br>
"But you were kind enough to point out that it would suit me, and I put it on and liked<br>
<br>
it, so I'm buying it."<br>
<br>
She took her bag back from him and went to the register with the dress in her arms,<br>
<br>
so Amane followed her in a fluster.<br>
<br>
He started fishing his wallet out, thinking he ought to pay for it, since he was the one<br>
<br>
who said it would suit Mahiru, but she stopped him as she was already groping around<br>
<br>
in her own bag.<br>
<br>
"You can't pay. I need to buy this myself and show it off to you."<br>
<br>
"O-oh."<br>
<br>
"Though I won't be able to wear it until it gets warmer. I'll hold on to it until summer.<br>
<br>
You can look forward to seeing it."<br>
<br>
She looked bashful as she finished paying, and Amane shut his mouth tight and tried<br>
<br>
desperately to resist the urge to collapse on the spot.<br>
<br>
Dammit, she's saying such ridiculously cute things. It sounds like she's saying she's going<br>
<br>
to wear it just for me. My heart can't take this.<br>
<br>
He caught the eye of the store clerk who was taking Mahiru's payment, and she smiled<br>
<br>
at him with a truly friendly expression, so Amane couldn't do anything but bite his lip<br>
<br>
and avert his eyes.<br>
<br>
Amane and Mahiru had enjoyed window-shopping together—actually, since they'd<br>
<br>
made a purchase, it was more accurate to just call it shopping at this point—but<br>
<br>
Amane had temporarily split off from Mahiru and was on his own.<br>
<br>
That was because Mahiru had gone to buy something she wanted to check out on her<br>
<br>
own and said she needed to be alone for a bit. This outing had been Mahiru's suggestion<br>
<br>
to begin with, and Amane figured that girls had all sorts of shopping that they wouldn't<br>
<br>
want other people to know about, so he readily parted ways and went over to a pillar<br>
<br>
near the mall fountain they'd designated as a meeting place.<br>
<br>
Amane was plenty used to accompanying women on marathon shopping trips thanks<br>
<br>
to his mother, and he was also accustomed to waiting for them when they dragged him<br>
<br>
around places. At the end of the day, he didn't dislike waiting quietly by himself, so he<br>
<br>
did just that, without the slightest shred of irritation.<br>
<br>
The staring decreased after he split off from Mahiru, which made him a little more<br>
<br>
comfortable, and this intermission was just what he needed to give his overburdened<br>
<br>
heart a brief rest.<br>
<br>
…She's so adorable and keeps touching me. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on…<br>
<br>
Mahiru was showing a side of herself she usually held back. She was joyful and<br>
<br>
genuine and unspeakably charming.<br>
<br>
Mahiru must have been perfectly aware of just how extraordinary her appearance<br>
<br>
was, but she also seemed indifferent to her own beauty. Maybe it was because Amane<br>
<br>
treated her as a friend and didn't make a big deal about it, but she didn't make a fuss<br>
<br>
about her looks in front of him, and she let him see her natural cuteness, smell her<br>
<br>
sweetness, feel her softness, and so much more. Amane knew he was extremely lucky<br>
<br>
to be able to enjoy her company like that, but he felt too guilty to really appreciate it.<br>
<br>
He was racked with shame just remembering it all, but he couldn't let it show in public,<br>
<br>
so he drew his lips in tight and quietly closed his eyes.<br>
<br>
All these thoughts were making him restless, so he shook his head slowly to drive them<br>
<br>
from his mind.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Amane heard a high-pitched voice from close by. "Um, excuse me."<br>
<br>
His eyes snapped open at the sound of an unfamiliar voice, and he looked forward to<br>
<br>
see two girls smiling at him. They were probably about college age. At least, they<br>
<br>
looked older than him. They were dressed stylishly for a Golden Week outing and<br>
<br>
smiling at Amane, who had his eyes narrowed suspiciously.<br>
<br>
"Excuse me, are you alone? Do you have some free time?"<br>
<br>
He was astonished to hear the girls ask him that.<br>
<br>
He would have thought that, with his head hung low, it would have been obvious he<br>
<br>
didn't want to talk to anybody, so it shocked him that these girls were so bold. It was<br>
<br>
unfortunate that they seemed to have no eye for quality. 5<br>
<br>
Even as suspicions flickered through Amane's mind about why these girls would have<br>
<br>
gone out of their way to come talk to him, when he wasn't even that nicely put together,<br>
<br>
he knew it would be rude to ignore them entirely, so he went ahead and looked at them<br>
<br>
with a bland expression.<br>
<br>
"No, I'm waiting for someone."<br>
<br>
He was hoping they would infer the situation from all the women-oriented brands<br>
<br>
emblazoned on the many shopping bags Mahiru had left with him, but the girls didn't<br>
<br>
seem to notice. Perhaps the bags didn't stand out because of their simple designs.<br>
<br>
"I appreciate the invitation, but I've got a previous engagement, so—"<br>
<br>
"In that case, your friend can come with us, too! We'll get tea or something."<br>
<br>
They seemed to have decided that the friend he was waiting for was another guy.<br>
<br>
If he and Mahiru had been dating, he could tell them he was waiting for his girlfriend<br>
<br>
and easily turn them away with that one word, but he and Mahiru weren't actually<br>
<br>
dating, and she wasn't here with him at the moment, so if he claimed she was his<br>
<br>
girlfriend, he didn't know whether she would quickly back him up when she actually<br>
<br>
did reappear.<br>
<br>
Besides, he had once used that excuse to get her away from a drunk guy, and Mahiru<br>
<br>
had told him to stop saying it, so he hesitated to use it again on his own.<br>
<br>
He frowned slightly as he regarded the two girls, figuring he was probably stuck<br>
<br>
talking to them until he reunited with Mahiru—then, out of the corner of his eye, he<br>
<br>
spied some familiar flaxen hair.<br>
<br>
"Sorry for making you wait."<br>
<br>
Several seconds later, swinging her hair gently to the side and approaching with easy<br>
<br>
movements, his savior, the angel, appeared.<br>
<br>
She seemed to have seen that Amane was in trouble and had come quickly. Her<br>
<br>
breathing was a little too fast for having just walked.<br>
<br>
Mahiru smiled lightly at Amane, who had been trying to weather the waves of the girls'<br>
<br>
chatter with a stoic face, and practically leaped into his arms.<br>
<br>
By some stroke of luck, he managed to not let it show on his face, but Amane was<br>
<br>
startled beyond belief. Mahiru was looking up at him with her body angled just right<br>
<br>
so he couldn't see the girls behind her. He could sense amazement and dissatisfaction<br>
<br>
in her eyes and the unspoken question of "What are you doing?" all of which he<br>
<br>
recognized as a performance to help Amane extract himself from the situation.<br>
<br>
…She's making me super nervous; I wish she'd stop.<br>
<br>
This was all Amane's fault—he didn't want to hurt their feelings, but his indecision<br>
<br>
had been mistaken for an invitation to keep chatting him up. And Mahiru had arrived<br>
<br>
to rescue him, so he definitely couldn't complain about her methods. But he couldn't<br>
<br>
deny it was still stressing him out.<br>
<br>
Amane joined the charade by gently placing his hand on her back. It was a very<br>
<br>
intimate move to show they had a special relationship.<br>
<br>
"Don't worry about it," he said. "These nice girls were kind enough to keep me<br>
<br>
company, so it didn't feel like that long."<br>
<br>
"Oh really? Thank you for going to the trouble."<br>
<br>
Mahiru half turned around with a beaming smile, and the girls looked at her in blank<br>
<br>
amazement. The boy they had been trying to pick up was embracing a girl who seemed<br>
<br>
like his girlfriend. On top of that, she was incredibly cute.<br>
<br>
Mahiru must have realized why the girls were frozen in place, but her expression was<br>
<br>
full of good will, as if she had no idea. Amane was awestruck by her apparent<br>
<br>
magnanimity. She really did appear grateful, and her smile was the picture of innocence.<br>
<br>
But the girls just stared at them, without moving an inch. Amane smiled back, trying<br>
<br>
his best to act casual. "I'm sorry. Like I said before, I have a prior engagement, so…"<br>
<br>
Amane was relieved he'd given them that excuse earlier. He tapped on Mahiru's back<br>
<br>
impatiently, and Mahiru, who was still wearing a divine smile, entwined her arm with<br>
<br>
his, seemingly in good spirits.<br>
<br>
She was nestled very close to him again, and the breathless feeling in his chest returned,<br>
<br>
but he knew he couldn't allow himself to get flustered now. Not after Mahiru had gone<br>
<br>
to the trouble of putting on this act for him. So he feigned calm and bowed to the girls.<br>
<br>
Mahiru followed his lead and bowed, too, then at her urging, they turned and walked<br>
<br>
away from the girls.<br>
<br>
Once they had turned a corner and checked to make sure they couldn't be seen, Amane<br>
<br>
looked at Mahiru and saw her fake smile disappear.<br>
<br>
"What were you doing?" she asked in a tone of voice that was suddenly flat and<br>
<br>
detached as she looked up at him.<br>
<br>
Without meaning to, Amane chuckled at the suddenness of her transformation. She<br>
<br>
was still clinging tightly to him, but her expression looked weary and slightly<br>
<br>
displeased. She had seemed to be in a good mood earlier, but that had evidently been<br>
<br>
part of the act, for now shades of ill humor were flashing across her eyes.<br>
<br>
"You really saved me back there," Amane said.<br>
<br>
"I take my eyes off you for one second… Really, I was only gone for a short while.<br>
<br>
Unbelievable. I wouldn't have left you alone if I knew this would happen…" Mahiru was<br>
<br>
muttering to herself.<br>
<br>
With a sudden rush of guilt, Amane noticed his gaze had drifted lower and lower over<br>
<br>
Mahiru's body. He seemed to be the only one who was agitated by the close contact—<br>
<br>
Mahiru didn't seem to be paying it any mind.<br>
<br>
"You really don't know how to tell a stranger off, do you, Amane?" Mahiru didn't show<br>
<br>
any sign of being aware of Amane's internal turmoil. She just looked exasperated.<br>
<br>
"Maybe I can't turn them down, or maybe I just don't know how to handle that type of<br>
<br>
stranger. They were girls, so I didn't want to act rough or use strong language. I<br>
<br>
wouldn't know what to do if I made them cry or something."<br>
<br>
"Honestly, I don't know whether you're gentlemanly or a total loser."<br>
<br>
"Hey, shut up, that was the first time something like that has ever happened to me, so<br>
<br>
I couldn't help it. I never would've imagined in a million years that girls would come<br>
<br>
over and talk to me."<br>
<br>
Amane never would have thought, with so many people hanging around, that someone<br>
<br>
would talk to him of all people.<br>
<br>
"Assertive girls are incredible, huh? They even approach antisocial guys like me."<br>
<br>
"…The way you look now isn't really antisocial… If anything, you look more like a fresh,<br>
<br>
friendly young man."<br>
<br>
"Those are very nice words that don't describe me at all."<br>
<br>
"Well, a makeover can only go so far…"<br>
<br>
"How nice of you to say."<br>
<br>
Mahiru was right—even if he looked a little nicer on the outside, there could be no<br>
<br>
mistake that inside he was as gloomy as ever. Amane laughed despite himself.<br>
<br>
This straightforward way of speaking was also one of the things he appreciated about<br>
<br>
Mahiru. He found it very endearing. It was far preferable to being lied to.<br>
<br>
He knew she definitely was not intending to disparage him, so he accepted her words<br>
<br>
with a gentle understanding.<br>
<br>
But Mahiru sighed for some reason. "Okay, I suppose I have to just tell you outright.<br>
<br>
You're definitely not bright or cheerful, but I wouldn't say you're gloomy, either. To me,<br>
<br>
you seem calm and composed, and when I'm with you, I feel calm, too. Like I can relax.<br>
<br>
Even if we're not talking, I feel comfortable when I'm by your side, and I think that's<br>
<br>
wonderful."<br>
<br>
"…Oh, you do?"<br>
<br>
Her compliments were embarrassing, and Amane could only manage a short reply.<br>
<br>
Mahiru didn't seem satisfied, though. She pressed against his arm again, seemingly<br>
<br>
unaware of how weak it made him.<br>
<br>
"And how do you feel when you're with me?"<br>
<br>
"…At home, I feel calm."<br>
<br>
"And now?"<br>
<br>
"…Now I can't relax at all. Because someone keeps pressing her chest up against me." 1<br>
<br>
That must have been completely unexpected, and she must have been completely<br>
<br>
unaware of what she was doing, because Mahiru froze stiff and looked down at her<br>
<br>
own chest.<br>
<br>
And then her face turned red with such force she looked like a boiling kettle.<br>
<br>
"I thought you were doing it on purpose."<br>
<br>
When he joked that she had been causing him terrible distress, to the point it bordered<br>
<br>
on harassment, she glared up at him with slightly teary eyes. It didn't have the slightest<br>
<br>
impact, probably because he knew she was doing it to hide her embarrassment.<br>
<br>
"Wha—? Y-you dummy, I would never!"<br>
<br>
"I know that. I was joking, sorry."<br>
<br>
He knew that if he teased her too much she would start sulking, so he apologized<br>
<br>
quickly to defuse the bomb. Mahiru's raging emotions now extinguished, she grumbled<br>
<br>
only a small complaint. But she didn't really have anything more to say and instead<br>
<br>
settled on punching him once in the side to vent her anger.<br>
<br>
Smiling at her obvious frustration, Amane took hold of her hand again to make sure<br>
<br>
there was some space between them.<br>
<br>
"Don't cling to me so closely."<br>
<br>
"…Can we still hold hands?"<br>
<br>
"I'll lose you if we don't."<br>
<br>
If they let go of each other and got lost in the Golden Week crowds, it would defeat the<br>
<br>
purpose of going out together in the first place.<br>
<br>
"…What would you do if you lost me?"<br>
<br>
"I would use my phone to contact you and pick a place to meet up, like normal."<br>
<br>
"How pragmatic."<br>
<br>
"Guess so. Well, I'll try not to let you go."<br>
<br>
If he let her slip from his grasp and made her wander around by herself, Mahiru was<br>
<br>
far more likely to get hit on, so he didn't intend to let her look like she was alone.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had specifically requested this outing and probably wanted to enjoy a pleasant<br>
<br>
day rather than being hounded by people she had no interest in. Besides, even though<br>
<br>
Amane knew Mahiru was often approached by other guys, he didn't have to like it.<br>
<br>
At Amane's words, Mahiru stared deeply into his eyes, then lowered her gaze to their<br>
<br>
joined hands. And then her lips curved softly into a smile, and in a voice as gentle as a<br>
<br>
blooming flower, she said, "…Yes. Please don't let me go." 1<br>
<br>
She whispered quietly and entwined her fingers with his. Trying not to let her sense<br>
<br>
his sudden panic, Amane responded in kind.<br>
<br>
"…So this is a game center…"<br>
<br>
After they finished at the clothing stores and variety shops and had made a few<br>
<br>
purchases, Amane led Mahiru to his favorite arcade.<br>
<br>
Coming here had been her idea. They had put this place last on their list of destinations;<br>
<br>
so even if they won prizes at the crane games, they wouldn't have to carry them around<br>
<br>
everywhere. After this, they were going straight home, so they had plenty of time.<br>
<br>
Finishing the day here had undoubtedly been the right call.<br>
<br>
Apparently, Mahiru had never come here with Chitose, either, and she looked adorable,<br>
<br>
marveling at everything around her.<br>
<br>
"There really are all sorts of games here, huh?"<br>
<br>
"Sure are. Not just crane games but arcade games and physical games, too. This game<br>
<br>
center has a ton of different types."<br>
<br>
"I can see that. And it's super loud."<br>
<br>
"Ah, most places like this are."<br>
<br>
Mahiru was frowning a little, reminding Amane that the cacophony typical of game<br>
<br>
centers could be grating to the ears for someone not accustomed to it. He was used to<br>
<br>
this ambience, so he was fine.<br>
<br>
The section with slots and arcade games was even louder, so he weaved his way<br>
<br>
around those areas as he walked through the game center with Mahiru following<br>
<br>
behind him.<br>
<br>
"So what'll you play?"<br>
<br>
"I want to try a crane game. I want to try winning a stuffed animal."<br>
<br>
Her sights seemed to be set on the crane games. She looked around that section of the<br>
<br>
game center, alternately squeezing and releasing his hand in her excitement.<br>
<br>
It was Golden Week, so the game center had gotten a lot of new prizes and had stocked<br>
<br>
plenty of cute stuffed animals that were more family-oriented, so there were plenty<br>
<br>
that Mahiru would probably like.<br>
<br>
"…Amane, I want to get that one."<br>
<br>
"Hmm, which one?"<br>
<br>
"That one. That cat… Don't you think it looks like Silky?"<br>
<br>
The toy Mahiru was pointing at was a cat with white fur that turned dark brown<br>
<br>
around its face. With its blue eyes, it did indeed resemble Silky, the cat who had first<br>
<br>
greeted Mahiru at the cat cafe , and she seemed enamored by it.<br>
<br>
"It really does look like her. You want it?"<br>
<br>
"I do. Can I try?"<br>
<br>
"Sure. I think the machines here are easy to win, but if you can't get it, I'll get it for<br>
<br>
you."<br>
<br>
"I'll try my best so you don't have to."<br>
<br>
Eager to take on this new challenge, Mahiru squared off against the crane game, while<br>
<br>
Amane hung back and watched. If Amane was to take a turn, he could easily secure the<br>
<br>
prize, but Mahiru wanted to win this one, and it was best to let her tackle the challenge<br>
<br>
alone.<br>
<br>
She inserted a coin and timidly pressed the first button to move the crane arm to the<br>
<br>
side for just a moment, then checked its position. Typical of the prudent Mahiru, she<br>
<br>
seemed to be confirming how far it would move with one press of the button.<br>
<br>
But with this type of crane game, once you let go of the button, it shifted into verticalmovement mode.<br>
<br>
"Wait, huh? It won't move."<br>
<br>
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you. Once you let go of the button, it shifts to vertical movement,<br>
<br>
so you've only got the one chance."<br>
<br>
"Ah, so now…"<br>
<br>
"No matter what you do, it won't reach the stuffed animals."<br>
<br>
The toys were placed in the middle of a wide open space, but the arm had only barely<br>
<br>
moved away from the drop chute, and all that was left to set was vertical movement.<br>
<br>
No matter how Mahiru struggled, she wouldn't be able to touch the prizes.<br>
<br>
This game center also had the type of crane games that were timed and used a lever<br>
<br>
that could move in all directions, but this particular machine was the button type, so<br>
<br>
there was unfortunately no going back. This happened to a lot of people when they<br>
<br>
were first playing crane games, so there was really no getting around it.<br>
<br>
"Well, that hundred yen is gone, but you still have the vertical movement, so you can<br>
<br>
use this as a chance to get a feel for the speed the arm moves and the lag after you<br>
<br>
release the button. Then you can use that information on your next try."<br>
<br>
"Hmm… I'll do that. It's my fault for being careless," she said, then moved the arm with<br>
<br>
intense concentration, paying careful attention to the speed.<br>
<br>
Amane felt like he hadn't given her enough warning on her first attempt, so he quietly<br>
<br>
inserted another coin, which made Mahiru look at him with dissatisfaction. Amane<br>
<br>
said "It's fine" and patted her on the back for encouragement. Reluctantly, she returned<br>
<br>
to her game.<br>
<br>
She must have more or less figured out the speed at which the arm moved, because on<br>
<br>
her next attempt, she was able to line it up laterally with the position of the stuffed<br>
<br>
animals.<br>
<br>
It was somewhat off-center, but she still had a chance to reach her target along the<br>
<br>
vertical axis. Even if she didn't grab right in the center of the toys, considering the<br>
<br>
arm's center of gravity and the force of its grip, plus the timing of when it released, she<br>
<br>
could still get something.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was a total beginner, but Amane was impressed with how skillfully she was<br>
<br>
already playing. She carefully moved the arm along the vertical axis until it was more<br>
<br>
or less above the stuffed animals, then tried to pick up the stuffed cat.<br>
<br>
Her aim was good, but the toy was slightly oblong, so when the arm squeezed, the<br>
<br>
center of gravity shifted immediately, and the cat fell.<br>
<br>
"Hmm."<br>
<br>
"Almost. Instead of trying to pick up the actual toy, it'll be easier if you move it with<br>
<br>
one side of the crane arm and take advantage of its center of gravity to make it roll<br>
<br>
over."<br>
<br>
Luckily, the partition around the drop chute wasn't very tall, so if she could roll the cat,<br>
<br>
it should fall down.<br>
<br>
Mahiru blinked intently, then obediently carried out the movements as she had been<br>
<br>
told.<br>
<br>
One thing he appreciated about Mahiru was her ability to take advice without getting<br>
<br>
angry or stubborn.<br>
<br>
She made another attempt for the cat, taking into account the position of the arm and<br>
<br>
the stuffed animal's center of gravity.<br>
<br>
"So I'll do this here… and move the head…"<br>
<br>
Mahiru's serious expression was reflected in the game cabinet's glass. Amane laughed<br>
<br>
quietly so she wouldn't hear him.<br>
<br>
After inserting several more coins and trying for a while, Mahiru finally moved the toy<br>
<br>
into the prize chute with the crane arm.<br>
<br>
She let out a quiet gasp as the stuffed cat fell with a plunk against the flap covering the<br>
<br>
end of the prize chute.<br>
<br>
After a moment of silence, Mahiru looked up at Amane, slightly stunned.<br>
<br>
"…It fell."<br>
<br>
"Yeah, good work… Look, it's proof of your victory."<br>
<br>
Amane retrieved the stuffed animal she had fought so hard for and held it out to<br>
<br>
Mahiru. The reality that she had finally won the prize seemed to be sinking in. Right<br>
<br>
before his eyes, an expression of delight transformed her beautiful features.<br>
<br>
"I—I got it. I got it, Amane!"<br>
<br>
"You sure did. You did great for your first time."<br>
<br>
He patted her head for a job well done, and she squinted in embarrassment and tightly<br>
<br>
embraced her prize, the stuffed cat that closely resembled Silky.<br>
<br>
She seemed especially happy that she had won the toy by herself and smiled in<br>
<br>
satisfaction as she rubbed her cheek against the stuffed animal.<br>
<br>
Amane was feeling a bit jealous of the stuffed cat as she squeezed it tightly with a<br>
<br>
cherubic smile. He was having a hard time keeping his emotions in check as he watched<br>
<br>
her celebrate.<br>
<br>
Mahiru embraced the stuffed animal with an expression of incredible delight, but then<br>
<br>
suddenly she looked in Amane's direction and timidly held the toy out to him.<br>
<br>
"…Um, will you… accept this?"<br>
<br>
"Huh, me?"<br>
<br>
"Well, you've given me so many, and you seemed to really like Silky, so…"<br>
<br>
Amane liked cats, and that cat in particular had been cute in the way she resembled<br>
<br>
Mahiru. But he couldn't come out and say that, so he just scratched his cheek and<br>
<br>
nodded.<br>
<br>
"…Or you're a guy, so you don't need stuffed animals; is that it…?"<br>
<br>
"No, that's not why. I was just wondering if it's really all right for me to take it, since<br>
<br>
you worked so hard to win it."<br>
<br>
"I was trying to win it for you. I mean, I don't want to sound pushy, umm… But you said<br>
<br>
it looked like Silky, so I thought maybe you liked it, so… If you don't want it, I'll decorate<br>
<br>
my apartment with it, but…" She looked up at him uneasily, shoulders drooping a little<br>
<br>
as if disheartened. There was no way he could turn it down now.<br>
<br>
"All right, I'll take it and keep it in my room. Though I, uh… I won't put it by my pillow<br>
<br>
like you did with yours."<br>
<br>
"I—I wish you'd forget about that…"<br>
<br>
"I'll treasure the cat."<br>
<br>
Amane politely accepted the stuffed animal from Mahiru, grabbed a carrying bag for<br>
<br>
prizes from the dispenser nearby, and placed the cat inside.<br>
<br>
Mahiru watched him with a happy smile, and Amane was just about to extend his hand<br>
<br>
to her again, when—<br>
<br>
"Huh? Shiina?"<br>
<br>
A voice called out to her from somewhere nearby, and Amane froze.<br>
<br>
Mahiru stiffened, too, and they both turned awkwardly to face the direction the voice<br>
<br>
had come from. Standing there was a young man whose handsome face was both<br>
<br>
innocent and dignified… Yuuta Kadowaki.<br>
<br>
"Kadowaki?"<br>
<br>
At the sight of Yuuta, Mahiru immediately put on her angelic smiling face that she<br>
<br>
displayed at school. But it seemed a little stiffer than usual, probably because she was<br>
<br>
still struggling to regain her composure.<br>
<br>
It was Golden Week, so they were well aware there was a good possibility of running<br>
<br>
into their classmates, but they had never expected to meet someone they had recently<br>
<br>
started hanging out with.<br>
<br>
"It's surprising to see you in a game center… Uh, did I interrupt something, perhaps?"<br>
<br>
Yuuta noticed Amane and looked worried. He didn't seem to have recognized yet that<br>
<br>
it was Amane, but as soon as Amane spoke, he was sure to be found out. On the other<br>
<br>
hand, Yuuta's attention was focused on Mahiru, so there was a chance that Amane<br>
<br>
could escape notice.<br>
<br>
"No, not at all…," Mahiru said.<br>
<br>
"This is the first I've heard about you having a boyfriend, you know."<br>
<br>
"He's not my boyfriend; we don't have that kind of relationship."<br>
<br>
Amane felt a twinge of heartache at Mahiru's flat denial, but it was true that they 1<br>
<br>
weren't dating, so he really didn't have any right to complain. It would have been<br>
<br>
stranger if she'd said otherwise.<br>
<br>
"W-well, to all appearances… Hmm?"<br>
<br>
Yuuta, obviously bewildered by Mahiru's stubborn demeanor, was about to question<br>
<br>
her again, when he suddenly focused his attention on Amane.<br>
<br>
Their eyes met, and Amane's cheek twitched.<br>
<br>
Yuuta stared hard, as if puzzling over what he saw. This was an extremely bad situation<br>
<br>
for Amane.<br>
<br>
"…Fujimiya?"<br>
<br>
Just as Amane expected, Yuuta recognized him.<br>
<br>
They hadn't been hanging out for that long yet, but even so, it was clear that Yuuta was<br>
<br>
perceptive. No matter how differently Amane dressed or styled his hair, he couldn't<br>
<br>
deceive his new friend.<br>
<br>
Amane had hoped that maybe Yuuta wouldn't look at a stranger so closely, and he did<br>
<br>
look pretty different today, but Yuuta didn't miss the connection.<br>
<br>
"Huh, Fujimiya… It's you, right? I can tell now that I see you up close… Could it be, you<br>
<br>
two knew each other long ago and met again at school?"<br>
<br>
"No, well…"<br>
<br>
Yuuta seemed to take it as confirmation when he saw Mahiru hesitating to answer. He<br>
<br>
looked back and forth between Mahiru and Amane, appearing downright astonished.<br>
<br>
Before he'd started hanging out with Yuuta, Amane might have denied everything, but<br>
<br>
now that wasn't even remotely possible. He sighed heavily and pressed on his forehead,<br>
<br>
then looked up at Yuuta, who was wearing an inquisitive expression.<br>
<br>
"…I'm impressed that you recognized me."<br>
<br>
"I knew it! Well, somehow I just knew it was you, Fujimiya."<br>
<br>
"Is it that easy to tell?"<br>
<br>
"Nah, I don't think anyone in our class would figure you out that quickly. You don't<br>
<br>
make that sort of face very often."<br>
<br>
Amane wasn't sure what "that sort of face" meant, but for the time being, Yuuta didn't<br>
<br>
seem to have made the connection between Amane and the "mystery man" Mahiru<br>
<br>
had been spotted with, so he was relieved.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, it's really something else to run into the both of you, together like this."<br>
<br>
"…There's no point in hiding it, so I'll just tell you. It's like you said, we have indeed<br>
<br>
known each other since before we started second year. I'll even admit to being good<br>
<br>
friends. But we really don't have the kind of relationship that you're imagining,<br>
<br>
Kadowaki."<br>
<br>
"…Oh really?"<br>
<br>
"Really."<br>
<br>
Mahiru had not hesitated to deny that there was something going on, so even though<br>
<br>
it made him sad to say it, Amane was also clear in his denial. It would cause trouble<br>
<br>
for Mahiru if the misunderstanding went any further or became more complicated.<br>
<br>
The one who found them just happened to be Yuuta, so he wasn't all that worried, but<br>
<br>
there would be trouble if others became suspicious—and their secret got out. He<br>
<br>
absolutely had to forbid Yuuta to speak of it.<br>
<br>
Amane adopted a firm stance, and Mahiru grasped his sleeve and looked up at him.<br>
<br>
She seemed to have something to say but didn't make any move to open her mouth, so<br>
<br>
for the time being, he didn't press her.<br>
<br>
Yuuta watched Amane's and Mahiru's behavior, and whether he understood or didn't,<br>
<br>
he shrugged slightly.<br>
<br>
"Hmm… Well, that's all fine and good. I have to say, it's just like Itsuki said."<br>
<br>
"What did he say?"<br>
<br>
Amane's eyes narrowed involuntarily when he thought about Itsuki having some slip<br>
<br>
of the tongue.<br>
<br>
"Nothing you need to worry about." Yuuta laughed. "But he said you look cool when<br>
<br>
you get dressed up properly. I was just thinking you do look really sharp."<br>
<br>
"That sounds sarcastic coming from you, Kadowaki."<br>
<br>
Amane could do nothing but smile bitterly at the compliment from the top heartthrob<br>
<br>
in their year, maybe in the whole school.<br>
<br>
Yuuta was the type of guy who didn't have to try to be attractive. Guys like Amane, who<br>
<br>
had to spend time getting dressed up just to look decent, were always destined to be<br>
<br>
jealous of guys like him. Amane didn't go so far as to begrudge the other boy his good<br>
<br>
looks, but he did on occasion imagine having a more lustrous life if he'd only had the<br>
<br>
good fortune to be born like that.<br>
<br>
"I wasn't trying to be sarcastic. Just saying, you should style yourself like this all the<br>
<br>
time."<br>
<br>
"No way; it would be a pain to set my hair every morning. And it would stand out if I<br>
<br>
suddenly showed up at school looking like this."<br>
<br>
"Well, that is true, but… Shiina, you must have known that Fujimiya could look like<br>
<br>
this?"<br>
<br>
"That's, well… Yes."<br>
<br>
Mahiru nodded uncomfortably as Yuuta turned to study her.<br>
<br>
It wasn't a look of scrutiny or distrust. More like he was searching for clues.<br>
<br>
"Mm-hmm, I think I understand."<br>
<br>
"Understand what?"<br>
<br>
"That you also don't want to cause Shiina any trouble."<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked startled by his words. Yuuta laughed quietly and said, "You're easier to<br>
<br>
read that I expected, Shiina."<br>
<br>
He gave a thin smile. It looked somewhat warm, yet lonely in a way—and perhaps even<br>
<br>
tinged with a bit of jealousy.<br>
<br>
"Um, Kadowaki?" Mahiru asked hesitantly.<br>
<br>
"Hmm?"<br>
<br>
"Well… I'd like to ask you not to say anything about this to other people. About us being<br>
<br>
f-friends, and… everything." Mahiru would be troubled if he said anything, so she also<br>
<br>
asked for his silence.<br>
<br>
Yuuta nodded readily. "Ah, you don't have to worry about that. I think I understand<br>
<br>
why you want to keep this hidden, and I appreciate how you feel. Besides, I've found<br>
<br>
that once rumors about you are spread around, you don't much enjoy spreading them<br>
<br>
yourself."<br>
<br>
Amane had never been so grateful that Yuuta was such a person of character. Also, he<br>
<br>
imagined that their situation was probably something Yuuta could deeply relate to. He<br>
<br>
was extremely popular with the girls at school, and so he often had to deal with<br>
<br>
jealousy from members of his own sex, and on the flip side, if he ever made friends<br>
<br>
with a member of the opposite sex, that girl would be in danger. He had told Amane as<br>
<br>
much, so he was probably speaking from experience.<br>
<br>
Even if they didn't have a romantic relationship, if it became known that a plain guy<br>
<br>
like Amane had become friends with the graceful angel Mahiru, who turned away<br>
<br>
every suitor, there was bound to be trouble.<br>
<br>
Amane was very grateful that Yuuta apparently understood that and would keep his<br>
<br>
peace.<br>
<br>
"Thanks, Kadowaki."<br>
<br>
"Yeah, well, I think it's the normal thing to do. And besides, I wouldn't want to do<br>
<br>
anything to jeopardize our relationship, Fujimiya. Not after I finally managed to make<br>
<br>
a friend."<br>
<br>
Yuuta flashed one of his bright smiles at them, and looking at him, Amane keenly<br>
<br>
understood why this boy was so popular. Even speaking as another boy, Amane thought<br>
<br>
that Yuuta was a friendly, earnest guy, so he could understand how the girls might find<br>
<br>
him utterly charming. It wasn't just because he was handsome; he was also a good<br>
<br>
person. The other guys in their class didn't stand a chance.<br>
<br>
"Oh, that's right. Fujimiya?"<br>
<br>
"Hmm?"<br>
<br>
"I'll see you the day after tomorrow."<br>
<br>
That day, which Yuuta casually mentioned in a slightly coy tone, was the day when<br>
<br>
Amane, Itsuki, and Yuuta had planned to go to karaoke together. In other words, Yuuta<br>
<br>
was telling him he would be asking for more details about this situation then.<br>
<br>
When their eyes met, Yuuta was wearing a playful smile, underpinned by his peculiar<br>
<br>
brand of confidence.<br>
<br>
"Got it," Amane answered, though he really felt like running away.<br>
<br>
Mahiru watched Amane and Yuuta with a hint of jealousy.<br>
<br>
"Sorry about that."<br>
<br>
They had separated from Kadowaki and were on their way home, and on the walk to<br>
<br>
the apartments from the nearest train station, Amane apologized to Mahiru in a quiet<br>
<br>
voice.<br>
<br>
Mahiru, who was quite satisfied that she had won some other small toys at the game<br>
<br>
center, blinked her caramel-coloured eyes in surprise at this sudden apology.<br>
<br>
"What are you apologizing for, all of a sudden?"<br>
<br>
"Well… for getting found out by Kadowaki."<br>
<br>
"Surely that was an accident. Besides, I think everything turned out all right. He<br>
<br>
seemed to be rather understanding…"<br>
<br>
Now that she said that, he knew it was true, but even so, he was annoyed that someone<br>
<br>
suspected that they were dating.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, Yuuta had not hung around long, probably because he could tell how<br>
<br>
uncomfortable Amane was in that situation. Still, it had tugged at Amane's heart to<br>
<br>
hear Mahiru deny everything so definitively.<br>
<br>
"Besides, it's not like we weren't aware that something like this could happen when<br>
<br>
we decided to go out," Mahiru continued. "Considering the possibilities, I think we're<br>
<br>
lucky it was Kadowaki who saw us."<br>
<br>
"You're right. For better or worse, Kadowaki knows, but at least he's being cool about<br>
<br>
it. He really is a stand-up guy."<br>
<br>
It's a good thing he's the one we ran into.<br>
<br>
Amane had resigned himself to being cross-examined later, but when he considered<br>
<br>
that he would no longer have to feel guilty about continuing to conceal things from<br>
<br>
Yuuta at school, it was actually probably a good thing that they were discovered.<br>
<br>
Amane had a feeling that Yuuta had also discerned how he felt about Mahiru, but as<br>
<br>
long as he didn't tell Mahiru herself, there would be no problem on that front.<br>
<br>
He would probably get teased a little bit at karaoke, but Yuuta and Itsuki both had<br>
<br>
some discretion in that area, so he shouldn't get it too bad.<br>
<br>
"…Amane, you have quite a high opinion of Kadowaki, don't you?"<br>
<br>
"Hmm? Uh, I guess so. We've had more and more chances to talk, and I've come to<br>
<br>
realize he's popular because he's a really good guy. He's really attractive inside and<br>
<br>
out."<br>
<br>
"And you trust him, don't you?"<br>
<br>
"Trust him…? Well… Yeah, I think he's a stand-up guy."<br>
<br>
Amane already knew he could be pretty picky about the people he hung out with. If he<br>
<br>
didn't like someone's personality, he would naturally keep them at arm's length. But<br>
<br>
Amane's gut told him that Yuuta was a good guy, and that was exactly why he wasn't<br>
<br>
too panicked at being found out.<br>
<br>
"All right, well, they do say birds of a feather flock together," Mahiru mused.<br>
<br>
"I don't know if I belong to that flock…"<br>
<br>
"You're putting yourself down again, Amane. Kadowaki decided to be friends with you<br>
<br>
because he liked your personality, right? Isn't that the same thing you thought about<br>
<br>
him? And Kadowaki, who you think is trustworthy, recognizes something good in you,<br>
<br>
so you ought to have more confidence."<br>
<br>
Mahiru gently poked his cheek with the tip of her finger, and Amane smiled softly at<br>
<br>
her.<br>
<br>
Of course he couldn't grant her wish, but as someone who always thought the worst<br>
<br>
of himself, he was grateful for her reassurance.<br>
<br>
Amane chuckled quietly at Mahiru's sudden lecture on self-confidence, but he also felt<br>
<br>
very grateful toward her.<br>
<br>
"You're always saying nice things about me, huh, Mahiru?"<br>
<br>
"Well, I'm only telling the truth. It's not good for you to always be so hard on yourself."<br>
<br>
"It's a habit."<br>
<br>
"Well, why did you develop that bad habit? It's a real pain, you know." Mahiru grumbled<br>
<br>
in open frustration.<br>
<br>
He wasn't sure how to answer the question. Though he knew perfectly well the reason<br>
<br>
why.<br>
<br>
The simple answer was that he was afraid of failure.<br>
<br>
Humans are quick learners. That goes for things both good and bad. Amane didn't<br>
<br>
want to fail, and he didn't want to get his hopes up, only for others to turn on him. So<br>
<br>
in order to protect himself from disappointment, he kept his expectations low.<br>
<br>
But he didn't know how he should tell Mahiru that. And honestly, he didn't particularly<br>
<br>
want to have to explain it.<br>
<br>
Mahiru stared at him with clear eyes, like she could read his mind. Then just as he<br>
<br>
started feeling uncomfortable, she looked away, leaned toward him, and pressed<br>
<br>
herself against his upper arm again.<br>
<br>
"If you don't want to tell me, you don't have to, but please just remember that I accept<br>
<br>
you, okay? It's not good to be so hard on yourself."<br>
<br>
"…Sure."<br>
<br>
"If I need to, I'm going to praise you until you beg me to stop."<br>
<br>
"Whoa, scary. You say it like that, but I really do want you to stop. I can't take it<br>
<br>
anymore."<br>
<br>
"Well then, you need to have more self-confidence."<br>
<br>
Mahiru smiled faintly and squeezed his hand. Feeling heat gradually surging up<br>
<br>
through his chest but not wanting to destroy this pleasant moment, Amane didn't let<br>
<br>
go. He just replied with a quiet "Thanks" and kept walking down the road home.<br>
<br>
He didn't want to let go of her hand, but he knew that they would have to let go once<br>
<br>
they reached home, so he deliberately walked a little slowly, and Mahiru matched his<br>
<br>
pace without saying another word.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 36: An Interrogation<br>
<br>
"Now then, I would like to ask you a bit about what happened the day before<br>
<br>
yesterday."<br>
<br>
It was two days after Amane's outing with Mahiru. The day he had plans to go sing<br>
<br>
karaoke with Itsuki and Yuuta.<br>
<br>
As soon as they had assembled and entered their reserved room, Yuuta immediately<br>
<br>
turned to him with a smile.<br>
<br>
Amane had prepared himself for an interrogation, but even so, he felt really awkward<br>
<br>
being asked about this again.<br>
<br>
Itsuki seemed to have heard about the incident from Yuuta and was wearing an<br>
<br>
expression that said Uh-oh, you got caught! He wasn't even trying to hide his<br>
<br>
amusement.<br>
<br>
After bringing the cup of melon soda he had gotten from the self-service drink bar to<br>
<br>
his lips and wetting his throat, Amane reluctantly began to explain.<br>
<br>
"…It's nothing that serious. Itsuki and Chitose knew about it already. Mahiru and I live<br>
<br>
next door to each other. That was honestly a total coincidence. And well, a bunch of<br>
<br>
things happened, and we got closer, I guess."<br>
<br>
Thanks to Chitose, there was no use in trying to conceal the fact that they were already<br>
<br>
on a first-name basis, so as he explained the situation, he used Mahiru's name like he<br>
<br>
always did at home.<br>
<br>
"You got to know each other, and then you went out together?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah."<br>
<br>
They were obviously more than simple acquaintances. In the best-case scenario, they<br>
<br>
looked like friends, in the worst, lovers. But as far as Amane was concerned, for the<br>
<br>
sake of Mahiru's honor, he had to flatly deny everything.<br>
<br>
"It's definitely not the kind of relationship you're imagining, Kadowaki," he reasserted.<br>
<br>
"And I have a feeling it's not quite what you're describing, Fujimiya."<br>
<br>
"Come on—"<br>
<br>
"Their situation goes way beyond friends, I'd say," Itsuki interjected. "Considering<br>
<br>
Shiina comes over to make dinner for him every day."<br>
<br>
Amane's cheek twitched as he glared at his friend. "Itsuki!"<br>
<br>
"The truth was gonna come out sooner or later, so it's better to just hurry up and spill<br>
<br>
it all now."<br>
<br>
When he put it that way, Itsuki was probably right, but by suddenly providing the<br>
<br>
detail that Amane was eating Mahiru's home cooking every day, he all but guaranteed<br>
<br>
a misunderstanding.<br>
<br>
"…So she's like your girlfriend?"<br>
<br>
"Not even a little," Amane insisted. "We both live alone, so it's more convenient to split<br>
<br>
the food costs and make enough for two; that's all."<br>
<br>
"Yeah, that's definitely all it is…," Itsuki said without a trace of sincerity.<br>
<br>
Yuuta looked unimpressed. "That's not very convincing, Fujimiya…"<br>
<br>
"Not you too, Kadowaki…"<br>
<br>
He and Mahiru definitely were not in love with each other, but he was having a hard<br>
<br>
time explaining that, and the way Yuuta was staring at him was making him nervous.<br>
<br>
Not that he'd been all that composed to begin with.<br>
<br>
"Normally, a girl won't hang around a guy she doesn't approve of, and she definitely 1<br>
<br>
wouldn't follow him into his apartment. Unless she's the one chasing after him<br>
<br>
anyway."<br>
<br>
Yuuta's addendum at the end sounded like it came from a place of experience, which<br>
<br>
reminded Amane how wary Yuuta was of girls and their intentions. But he was right,<br>
<br>
more or less, Amane realized.<br>
<br>
Girls, and Mahiru in particular, were usually very careful and typically didn't approach<br>
<br>
guys without reason. Amane recognized that the fact that Mahiru associated with him<br>
<br>
at all was close to miraculous. But he knew this was a special case.<br>
<br>
Amane just couldn't imagine she would ever like him as a guy, or anything like that.<br>
<br>
Sometimes he even thought that the reason Mahiru was so comfortable around him<br>
<br>
was because she didn't even consider him a man.<br>
<br>
"…Fujimiya, you're so hard on yourself," Yuuta said. "And you can be really stubborn."<br>
<br>
"What he said," Itsuki agreed.<br>
<br>
Itsuki and Yuuta were both looking at Amane with exasperated looks, so it was really<br>
<br>
uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
"So when it comes down to it, do you like Shiina?"<br>
<br>
Yuuta chose to thrust this outrageous question at him at the exact moment Amane<br>
<br>
took a drink of his melon soda to mask his discomfort, and he very nearly spit it back<br>
<br>
out. "…Why would you ask that, all of sudden?" he sputtered.<br>
<br>
"Well, you're being pretty cagey, but I saw how you acted when you were out with<br>
<br>
Mahiru, so I'm sure you must care about her, even if only a little. Plus, I could tell by<br>
<br>
the way you looked at her—and by your whole demeanor, really—that you like her."<br>
<br>
Amane nodded meekly. "…Is there something wrong with that?"<br>
<br>
Man, Yuuta sure as hell pays close attention…<br>
<br>
For some reason, Yuuta smiled wryly at him. "No, it's not bad or anything, but… mmm,<br>
<br>
it probably won't be easy, I'd imagine."<br>
<br>
"I have no delusions about dating Mahiru."<br>
<br>
"Yes, yes, I can see there are still some things you don't understand. Itsuki's here to<br>
<br>
give you some encouragement, too."<br>
<br>
"You could say that," Itsuki muttered. "What I really want is to give him a strong kick<br>
<br>
in the ass."<br>
<br>
Yuuta nodded. "I know just how you feel."<br>
<br>
"Don't tell me that's where you two agree…," Amane groaned.<br>
<br>
So now Yuuta's ready to kick me in the butt, too?<br>
<br>
"Look, man, the thing is: It's really frustrating to watch," Itsuki said. "We want you to<br>
<br>
push the issue a little."<br>
<br>
"Give it a rest already!"<br>
<br>
"Hold on; just listen for a sec, all right?" Itsuki continued. "Shiina lets her guard down<br>
<br>
around you. If you put a little pressure on, she'll give in for sure."<br>
<br>
"Okay, listen, I admit, Mahiru probably likes me, but… she doesn't like me that way;<br>
<br>
you know what I mean?"<br>
<br>
Itsuki made it all sound so easy, but Amane knew better.<br>
<br>
To begin with, he was incredibly self-conscious about the very fact of his deep affection<br>
<br>
for Mahiru. He did have to admit that she seemed to care about him more than any<br>
<br>
other guy, but he didn't think her feelings were romantic. Instead, he figured it was<br>
<br>
something akin to the way you might feel about a close and trusted confidant.<br>
<br>
"How can you say that, when you've seen the way she looks at you?"<br>
<br>
"What would she find attractive about me?"<br>
<br>
When Amane offered that rebuttal, Itsuki smacked him on the back as hard as he<br>
<br>
could.<br>
<br>
"…Oww!"<br>
<br>
"I feel bad for hitting you, but come on, are you kidding me? You seriously have way<br>
<br>
too little confidence! You lose your nerve or run away at the most crucial moment."<br>
<br>
"…Yeah well, so what? That's just how I am. I can't help it."<br>
<br>
"We've got to break the habit, then. You're way too down on yourself."<br>
<br>
"Mahiru tells me that a lot."<br>
<br>
"…So it's bothering Shiina as well?" Yuuta asked.<br>
<br>
"It's bothering all of us who have to watch him!" Itsuki clamored. "This guy is so<br>
<br>
stubborn about things like that."<br>
<br>
"Shut up, will you!"<br>
<br>
Amane really hated it when people ganged up on him.<br>
<br>
This was just the way he was, and even if he did try to change, it certainly wouldn't be<br>
<br>
that easy. Traumatic memories didn't just go away because he wanted them to. Not<br>
<br>
enough time had passed yet for him to try to forget and move on.<br>
<br>
Amane was well aware of how pathetic and worthless he was, but there was nothing<br>
<br>
he could do.<br>
<br>
"I mean, I can't force your hand if you tell me you've had enough," Itsuki said. "But if<br>
<br>
you like Shiina, and you want to go out with her, you need to try harder."<br>
<br>
"…And you think I can do that?"<br>
<br>
"If you weren't such a wuss…"<br>
<br>
"Oh, shut up."<br>
<br>
"Come on, that's enough," Yuuta chided. "But I do have to say I agree with Itsuki. You<br>
<br>
should have a little more faith in yourself, Fujimiya. Really, you'd get a lot of attention<br>
<br>
at school if you dressed up like you did the other day. Maybe you should give it some<br>
<br>
practice."<br>
<br>
"Practice?"<br>
<br>
"Well, you didn't have any trouble getting dressed up for Shiina, and you didn't freak<br>
<br>
out when I saw you like that, either. So maybe practice your new look on people you<br>
<br>
know, so you can get used to it. A good way to enjoy this precious break, don't you<br>
<br>
think?"<br>
<br>
"…Meaning what?"<br>
<br>
"Let's see; I've got some hair wax in here somewhere…"<br>
<br>
Swiftly, Yuuta pulled some men's grooming wax out of his bag. When their eyes met,<br>
<br>
Yuuta was grinning boldly. Typical of the class prince, it was a lovely smile, but it sent<br>
<br>
a chill down Amane's spine. "So how about it?" he asked.<br>
<br>
"…I'll pass."<br>
<br>
"Come on now, don't be shy."<br>
<br>
"Hey, uh, aren't we at a karaoke parlor? Shouldn't we be doing karaoke or something?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, you're right!" Yuuta replied. "Okay, I'm gonna sing, so I'll entrust Amane to your<br>
<br>
capable care, Itsuki my friend."<br>
<br>
"Just leave it to me."<br>
<br>
"You've gotta be joking…," Amane muttered. All he got in return was an enthusiastic<br>
<br>
grin.<br>
<br>
"I mean, usually this isn't the kind of thing I'd do by force, but… in your case, Amane,<br>
<br>
it's time you got used to being the center of a little bit of attention, so I've got to take<br>
<br>
drastic measures!"<br>
<br>
"Hey, you can't… Waah!"<br>
<br>
Itsuki grinned and brandished the comb and hair wax, and though Amane tried to back<br>
<br>
away, there wasn't enough space for a proper retreat in the small karaoke room.<br>
<br>
Amane was forced to endure Yuuta's joyful singing while Itsuki meddled with his hair.<br>
<br>
"…Welcome ho… me…?"<br>
<br>
When Amane made it back to his apartment, Mahiru came out to greet him with a<br>
<br>
question in her voice.<br>
<br>
She was making stewed hamburger steaks for dinner and had let herself into Amane's<br>
<br>
apartment early to make the sauce.<br>
<br>
She had sent him a message saying that dinner was nearly done, so he knew that she<br>
<br>
would be at his place, but when he saw Mahiru's face again, he felt a rush of relief.<br>
<br>
"I'm back…"<br>
<br>
"Why do you look so worn out…?"<br>
<br>
"…Itsuki had his way with me."<br>
<br>
Itsuki had never seen Amane's "mystery man" look, so he had styled Amane's hair in<br>
<br>
a way he thought looked cool, which of course didn't really fit what Amane was used<br>
<br>
to.<br>
<br>
To make matters worse, after they were done with karaoke, the other boys had dragged<br>
<br>
him to a store that carried the type of clothes that Amane wasn't likely to have and<br>
<br>
then embarked on a hunt for something that would suit him.<br>
<br>
He hadn't particularly hated the experience or anything, but he was completely<br>
<br>
exhausted, having been treated like a dress-up doll by his two friends.<br>
<br>
"Uh-huh, you had a tough time, didn't you?"<br>
<br>
"…They played with me like a toy…"<br>
<br>
"You must be tired."<br>
<br>
Maybe because she could tell he wasn't actually upset, Mahiru let a quiet chuckle slip<br>
<br>
out as she commended him for his patience.<br>
<br>
Feeling slightly embarrassed at being so transparent, Amane tossed the bag containing<br>
<br>
the new clothes he had purchased into his room and went to the sink to wash his<br>
<br>
hands.<br>
<br>
Mahiru returned to the kitchen to serve dinner, so when Amane entered the living<br>
<br>
room after properly washing his hands and rinsing his mouth, she had already set the<br>
<br>
dishes of stewed hamburger steaks down on the dining table.<br>
<br>
Amane felt bad for not helping, so as he always did, he headed for the kitchen to dish<br>
<br>
up the cooked rice.<br>
<br>
Amane had always thought rice paired nicely with hamburger steak, and the<br>
<br>
indescribable sweet aroma of freshly cooked rice made him smile.<br>
<br>
"Man, I'm really tired… But actually, it made me appreciate Itsuki and Yuuta again.<br>
<br>
They're amazing."<br>
<br>
"What do you mean?"<br>
<br>
Once they had set out the salad and potage soup and taken their seats across the table,<br>
<br>
Mahiru tilted her head at Amane's curious grumblings.<br>
<br>
"Well, we got hassled constantly while we were walking around. It made me realize<br>
<br>
that guys who have always been popular are a different breed of human. They're used<br>
<br>
to that treatment, and the way they go through life is just different."<br>
<br>
When the boys had gone on their shopping tour after karaoke, for some reason, various<br>
<br>
girls who seemed to be about college age had come up to talk to them several times.<br>
<br>
Well, Itsuki and Yuuta were both handsome guys, although in different ways, so it<br>
<br>
seemed only natural for them to catch girls' eyes. They had experienced the so-called<br>
<br>
reverse pickup.<br>
<br>
They had declined every proposal, though. Itsuki had his true love, Chitose, and the<br>
<br>
class prince apparently hated pushy girls. He wore a sweet smile but was always on<br>
<br>
guard, and before long, their would-be dates got the message that he was turning them<br>
<br>
down. Even when he was rejecting them, Yuuta was affable and considerate, so he<br>
<br>
wouldn't hurt their feelings. And it seemed to work well for him. Amane had struggled<br>
<br>
to deal with a similar situation earlier, and he was impressed by his friend's wellpracticed tact.<br>
<br>
"…Did the girls talk to you, too, Amane?"<br>
<br>
"They did, but only because I happened to be with the guys."<br>
<br>
If he had to guess, the girls were really only interested in his two friends and saw<br>
<br>
Amane merely as a nice bonus. After all, as he well knew, he was very bad at talking to<br>
<br>
strangers. Once in a while, somebody would talk to him when he went out somewhere,<br>
<br>
but this time there had been two exceptionally handsome guys next to him, so no one<br>
<br>
was going to give him a second look.<br>
<br>
Amane shrugged and grinned wryly, but for some reason, Mahiru was sticking her lip<br>
<br>
out in a little pout.<br>
<br>
"What is it?" he asked. "You want to tell me I'm being too hard on myself?"<br>
<br>
"Well, there's also that… But that's not it."<br>
<br>
"What is it, then?"<br>
<br>
"…If you don't know, then don't worry about it," Mahiru said unhelpfully, before<br>
<br>
pressing her hands together in thanks. "Let's eat."<br>
<br>
Amane was perplexed, but he mimicked her and pressed his hands together, giving<br>
<br>
thanks for the food and for Mahiru.<br>
<br>
It was the day after the three boys had gone to karaoke.<br>
<br>
As usual, Mahiru had come over to Amane's apartment.<br>
<br>
Recently, she had been spending a lot of time there when she wasn't at school. In fact,<br>
<br>
since the start of Golden Week, she had been at his place almost every day. Even if she<br>
<br>
wasn't there during the day, she would always come over to make dinner in the<br>
<br>
evening. Amane was of course quite happy to have the object of his affections close by,<br>
<br>
so he let Mahiru do whatever she liked.<br>
<br>
Today, she was next to him playing on her phone. Fiddling with her phone was a<br>
<br>
completely normal thing to do, of course, but she was staring at the screen with a bit<br>
<br>
more enthusiasm than usual.<br>
<br>
And while it would have been an invasion of her privacy to peek at the screen, and<br>
<br>
Amane had no intention of doing so, he couldn't help but say something, since it was<br>
<br>
so unusual for Mahiru to be absorbed in her phone like that, when she usually only<br>
<br>
used it to contact someone or look something up.<br>
<br>
"What have you been looking at all this time?" Amane ventured, figuring that just<br>
<br>
asking wouldn't be rude.<br>
<br>
For some reason, Mahiru jumped at his question. Then she turned to look in Amane's<br>
<br>
direction with a nervous frown. Amane was puzzled. He wasn't sure what might make<br>
<br>
her act that way.<br>
<br>
Then Mahiru turned away from him. She only did that when she was feeling guilty<br>
<br>
about something.<br>
<br>
"…You're hiding something," Amane insisted.<br>
<br>
"H-hiding…? Well, promise you won't get mad?"<br>
<br>
"Are you doing something that would make me mad?"<br>
<br>
Amane had been told that his resting facial expression looked a bit sullen, but he very<br>
<br>
rarely got angry, and he had never before gotten truly upset with Mahiru. He didn't<br>
<br>
think she'd give him a reason to lose his temper—at worst, he could imagine getting a<br>
<br>
little annoyed.<br>
<br>
"…Depending on how you're feeling, you might get upset."<br>
<br>
"Hmm. Well, why don't you tell me, and we'll see?"<br>
<br>
"…Well, your mother has been… sending me old photos of you."<br>
<br>
"Oh, I'm sure she had plenty to share…"<br>
<br>
He had a lot of questions for his mother about why she thought it was okay to send<br>
<br>
Mahiru photos of him out of the blue like that.<br>
<br>
"W-well, there's a reason, you see. Your mother and I were talking, and we just<br>
<br>
happened to get on the subject of Children's Day, and… and I said 'I bet Amane was<br>
<br>
really cute when he was little… ' So you see…"<br>
<br>
"Wait, let me take a look at them. She didn't send you anything really outrageous,<br>
<br>
right?"<br>
<br>
When it came to old photos, there were sure to be some Amane had forgotten about.<br>
<br>
But he could definitely remember a few that captured embarrassing moments he<br>
<br>
would rather nobody see. His mother really ought to have let him inspect the pictures<br>
<br>
before sending any to Mahiru.<br>
<br>
Mahiru refused to answer his question. She wouldn't even look him in the eye. From<br>
<br>
her reaction, Amane could guess that the photos were something he wouldn't like. He<br>
<br>
glowered at her but wasn't about to try to rip the smartphone out of her hands, so he<br>
<br>
decided to press her until she capitulated and confessed.<br>
<br>
"Mahiru… would you rather cooperate and show me the photos, or am I gonna have<br>
<br>
to bug you till you do?"<br>
<br>
With a serious look on his face, Amane sat up on one knee and put a hand on the back<br>
<br>
of the sofa behind Mahiru's head. He leaned in close to her, leaving her with little room<br>
<br>
to escape.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's face would go pale when she saw he had cornered her… or so he thought, but<br>
<br>
instead she flushed red and squeezed her favorite cushion to her chest. She looked<br>
<br>
even more nervous than before but still wasn't talking.<br>
<br>
Is it that bad…?<br>
<br>
Amane had a sinking feeling. He continued staring intently into Mahiru's eyes, but he<br>
<br>
didn't get the reaction he was hoping for. Far from it, she tried to push the cushion into<br>
<br>
his face.<br>
<br>
Amane grabbed the cushion and tossed it aside. He didn't understand why she was<br>
<br>
making such a big fuss. Mahiru must not have been holding the cushion too tightly,<br>
<br>
because he was easily able to pull it out of her hand and send it rolling across the floor.<br>
<br>
Mahiru still hadn't budged from her spot on the sofa.<br>
<br>
"Come on; it's time to fess up," Amane whispered as he closed in to pinch her cheek.<br>
<br>
Without warning, Mahiru flopped down on the sofa. It happened so quickly that<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't react, and on her way down, Mahiru collided with the arm he'd been<br>
<br>
using to support himself, so he also lost his balance and tumbled down onto the sofa.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, he managed to catch himself before he crushed Mahiru, but he ended up<br>
<br>
much closer to her than he expected.<br>
<br>
Both of them froze at this sudden proximity. 3<br>
<br>
Their bodies weren't too close, but their faces were so close that their breath<br>
<br>
intertwined, and if he leaned in just a little, their noses would bump. Amane was close<br>
<br>
enough to see that the long eyelashes that rimmed Mahiru's wide, caramel-coloured<br>
<br>
eyes were quivering slightly. At this distance, Mahiru's characteristic sweet scent filled<br>
<br>
his nostrils, and he didn't know what he should do.<br>
<br>
Both of them were frozen stiff, but Mahiru was the first to move.<br>
<br>
Her light-pink lips trembled, and she squeezed her eyes shut tightly. Her face was<br>
<br>
flushed, and she was taking shallow, timid breaths. She appeared nervous, as if she<br>
<br>
was preparing for some kind of impact, but her lips looked soft and sweet. She seemed<br>
<br>
simultaneously innocent and alluring. Mahiru practically embodied such contradictions.<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't look away.<br>
<br>
The sight of her aroused both his desire to protect her and the urge to make her his,<br>
<br>
and in spite of his better judgment, Amane reached out his hand—<br>
<br>
—and pinched Mahiru on the cheek. 2<br>
<br>
"Wha—?"<br>
<br>
"…That's a funny face," he muttered with a wry chuckle.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's eyes flew open, and her expression changed in an instant. Instead of the<br>
<br>
bashfulness from before, now it was more like equal parts shame and anger. She glared<br>
<br>
at him through tear-filled eyes. "Is that what you're going to say after pinning a girl<br>
<br>
down and touching her face?"<br>
<br>
Amane smiled again. "Okay, okay, that was my bad. I wasn't expecting a struggle."<br>
<br>
"Oh, well excuse me for putting up a fight!" she replied. "It only happened because you<br>
<br>
pushed me down!"<br>
<br>
"That was because you were hiding the photos my mom sent you behind my back."<br>
<br>
"Ack!… Ughhh."<br>
<br>
When it became clear that Mahiru wasn't going to say anything else, Amane moved off<br>
<br>
of her, still smiling. He slipped a hand between the sofa and Mahiru's back and helped<br>
<br>
her sit up. Mahiru moved her lips like she was mumbling something to herself and<br>
<br>
made an odd expression.<br>
<br>
"So…," Amane said. "Are you going to let me examine my own photographs?"<br>
<br>
"…Knock yourself out," she said with resignation. She still sounded annoyed, and her 1<br>
<br>
face was as red as ever, but she showed Amane the image list from the chat between<br>
<br>
his mother and her.<br>
<br>
If he was to point out how badly she was blushing, she would probably rush right out<br>
<br>
of his apartment, so Amane resisted the urge to say anything else as he looked away<br>
<br>
so Mahiru couldn't see his face.<br>
<br>
…That was a surprise.<br>
<br>
Amane was trying to stay calm, but even now his heart was pounding out a rhythm<br>
<br>
with explosive force.<br>
<br>
He wasn't sure what he might have done to Mahiru if he hadn't stopped himself and<br>
<br>
pinched her instead. She had certainly shown no signs of stopping him.<br>
<br>
Man, I was almost a real jerk just then…<br>
<br>
Shame weighed heavy in his gut. Yes, it had been an accident, and maybe they were<br>
<br>
both at least a little bit to blame. But that certainly didn't make it okay to touch Mahiru<br>
<br>
so intimately, in a manner usually reserved for lovers. That would not have been<br>
<br>
acceptable.<br>
<br>
If he had gone ahead and kissed her, he was sure Mahiru would have burst into tears<br>
<br>
or something along those lines. It wouldn't have been right to do something like that.<br>
<br>
He wasn't her boyfriend or anything. And if he had done it anyway, she would have<br>
<br>
definitely cut him out of her life for good.<br>
<br>
Amane didn't want to be the kind of selfish person who only thought about what he<br>
<br>
wanted.<br>
<br>
"…Amane, you said you wanted to check the photos, but are you even going to look at<br>
<br>
them?" Mahiru asked. She sounded even more sullen than before, and when Amane<br>
<br>
looked in her direction, he saw that the redness in her face had finally started to abate<br>
<br>
somewhat, and she had her cheeks puffed out a bit.<br>
<br>
"Sorry, I was busy thinking."<br>
<br>
"Dummy."<br>
<br>
Mahiru didn't often insult him, and she had used a word that was kind of cute, but<br>
<br>
Amane could tell from her tone that she was running out of patience, so he quickly<br>
<br>
looked down at the smartphone.<br>
<br>
In the photo roll were pictures of Amane from preschool and elementary school. At a<br>
<br>
glance, he didn't see anything especially painful, so that was a relief, but there were<br>
<br>
images of him beaming with an innocent smile he couldn't even imagine emulating<br>
<br>
now, so he still felt awfully embarrassed.<br>
<br>
Amane's face was turning red for a different reason at this moment, and to distract<br>
<br>
himself from the shame welling up inside, he glanced over at Mahiru. She was no<br>
<br>
longer wearing a sullen expression—instead, she was staring dreamily out into space<br>
<br>
with her hand over her mouth, looking dazed. 3<br>
<br>
Sensing that he wasn't supposed to see her like that, Amane quickly lowered his eyes<br>
<br>
back to the phone.<br>
<br>
His heart was pounding again, and he tried to focus his eyes and his mind on anything<br>
<br>
else.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 37: None but You<br>
<br>
…Come to think of it, Amane, are you doing anything for Mother's Day?" Mahiru asked<br>
<br>
quietly, as if she had just remembered the holiday. They were watching television<br>
<br>
together, and she'd noticed a listing for a program labeled as a Mother's Day special.<br>
<br>
Amane had tried to casually change the channel, figuring that Mahiru wouldn't like<br>
<br>
being reminded of her parents, but she didn't seem particularly bothered.<br>
<br>
He nodded, feeling a little relieved that she wasn't upset. "Well, I guess I'll send a small<br>
<br>
present and a bouquet to the house."<br>
<br>
It was a little bit of a hassle, but she was his one and only mother, after all, and he<br>
<br>
figured as her son he ought to show his appreciation for everything she did for him.<br>
<br>
But since he was out of the house now, it wasn't like he could go say it in person.<br>
<br>
"Well, since I'm far away, that's about all I can do. If we still lived together or close by,<br>
<br>
I would try to do a little more, but…"<br>
<br>
"Like help with the housework?"<br>
<br>
"Honestly, if I try to help, I just end up making more work for her."<br>
<br>
Thanks to Mahiru, Amane had learned how to do basic housework, or at least enough<br>
<br>
to get along okay on his own. But he didn't think he would be able to do everything to<br>
<br>
his parents' standards, so they would just end up redoing everything in the end.<br>
<br>
"I guess you would."<br>
<br>
"I don't know how I feel about you agreeing with that…"<br>
<br>
"…But you have learned enough to keep up with the everyday chores. I mean, it's far<br>
<br>
from perfect, but you can get by now."<br>
<br>
"That's a harsh appraisal. That said, you're not wrong."<br>
<br>
"Heh-heh. You've still got a ways to go, Amane."<br>
<br>
"Yes, yes, I'm no match for the marvelous Miss Mahiru."<br>
<br>
"I'll say."<br>
<br>
Amane had a feeling that even if he spent his whole life working on it, he would never<br>
<br>
get as good at housework as Mahiru was now.<br>
<br>
Mahiru laughed, a little surprised by Amane's words, and slapped his upper arm, but<br>
<br>
there wasn't any malice behind it, so he didn't complain.<br>
<br>
"I don't know how your parents could make you live alone when you couldn't even<br>
<br>
take care of yourself, Amane."<br>
<br>
She probably hadn't meant to say that out loud—but she'd obviously been thinking it.<br>
<br>
When they'd first met, Amane had been such a mess that even Itsuki had been worried<br>
<br>
about him. So it was no surprise Mahiru would doubt him now. She knew exactly how<br>
<br>
bad it could get.<br>
<br>
Amane pretended not to notice the shock of pain that went through his chest and<br>
<br>
shrugged. "Actually, I don't think they ever wanted to let me out of their sight? a<br>
<br>
I was real loser with absolutely no life skills, after all."<br>
<br>
"So it was your decision to move out on your own?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah. Some stuff happened, and I didn't want to stay in my hometown anymore."<br>
<br>
If he made it sound too serious, Mahiru was likely to worry, so he tried to,<br>
<br>
gloss over it, attempting to keep his cool while he did.<br>
<br>
Mahiru froze. Immediately, shades of remorse began flickering through
<p></p>
her caramel-coloured eyes.
<p></p>
Amane hadn't meant to upset her, but Mahiru, who was particularly<br>
<br>
sensitive to other people's pain, had gotten a glimpse of the baggage he was carrying.<br>
<br>
Sometimes her insight could be troubling.<br>
<br>
Amane regretting mentioning it in the first place. He reached out and patted Mahiru<br>
<br>
on the head as she grimaced at him.<br>
<br>
"Ah, you really don't have to worry about it," he said. "Actually, it puts me in a tough<br>
<br>
spot if you're too worried about me. Really, it's not that big of a deal. There were just<br>
<br>
some guys in my hometown who I would rather not see again, so I left."<br>
<br>
In reality, it hadn't been that serious. Just that something he had earnestly believed in<br>
<br>
had crumbled from its very foundation; that's all. He hadn't been physically injured or<br>
<br>
anything like that, and now that he had cut off all contact with those guys, he was living<br>
<br>
a normal life, and the dull ache of old wounds had faded into the background.<br>
<br>
Despite what he said, Mahiru's melancholy expression didn't go away. Amane was<br>
<br>
stumped. "I'm really fine, you know?" he insisted. "If it was still painful, I wouldn't be<br>
<br>
talking about going home to visit. As far as I'm concerned, it's in the past."<br>
<br>
"…Liar."<br>
<br>
"Liar? Listen here—"<br>
<br>
"If you really were over it, you wouldn't be making that face."<br>
<br>
Mahiru trembled slightly as she extended a hand toward Amane's cheek. Her eyes<br>
<br>
were downcast, so he couldn't even see a reflection of his expression, but going off<br>
<br>
what she said, it probably wasn't anything good.<br>
<br>
"…If you don't want to say, that's fine. But it's painful for me to see you looking so hurt."<br>
<br>
"Don't say that. It's not that big of a deal; it's not even an interesting story, okay?"<br>
<br>
Amane insisted. "Are you still worried about it, even so?" he asked quietly, and Mahiru<br>
<br>
nodded slightly.<br>
<br>
Amane scratched his cheek and wondered what to do. He let out a soft sigh.<br>
<br>
"Hmm… I wonder where I should begin. Well, I guess it makes sense to start with why<br>
<br>
I wanted to leave my hometown, huh?"<br>
<br>
"…Yes."<br>
<br>
"It's because I wanted to get some distance from my friends… or I guess I should say<br>
<br>
from the people who I thought were my friends."<br>
<br>
It didn't sound like a very good reason for moving. Anyone else would probably think<br>
<br>
he was worrying too much over something small.<br>
<br>
And yet that time of his life was etched indelibly into Amane's memory.<br>
<br>
"How should I put this…?" he began. "Well, I was blessed with a good home environment."<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked a bit curious about this abrupt change in topic, but she must have<br>
<br>
understood that this was necessary to understand the full story because she listened<br>
<br>
quietly.<br>
<br>
"I had relatives—my parents and grandparents—who loved me, and we were well-off.<br>
<br>
Financially, I mean. They let me study and do whatever I wanted. I was very lucky, and<br>
<br>
I know that."<br>
<br>
His parents had been especially doting on him, since he was their only son, and they<br>
<br>
had raised him in a way that respected Amane's individuality.<br>
<br>
"But at that time, I wasn't really aware of how incredibly blessed I was, and I had never<br>
<br>
learned to be suspicious of people. I was surrounded by good people and was raised<br>
<br>
with love, so to be honest, I was a really naive child."<br>
<br>
Now Amane was sulky, but before the incident took place, he had been so honest and<br>
<br>
cheerful it was impossible to imagine, looking at him now. He had been a really<br>
<br>
childish child.<br>
<br>
"…I think that my naï vete made me especially easy to deceive and to use."<br>
<br>
And so there had been many openings to take advantage of him.<br>
<br>
"The new friends I made in the first half of middle school… I don't actually know if I<br>
<br>
can honestly call them friends, but the guys who I started hanging out with… Well, to<br>
<br>
tell the truth, they saw me as an easy mark, as a good source of money. When you come<br>
<br>
from a well-off family, it's only human for people to want to get something out of you."<br>
<br>
It sounded pathetic to say it, but back then, Amane had been honest to a fault and<br>
<br>
incredibly gullible. In other words, he was easy to fool. He'd grown up believing in the<br>
<br>
innate goodness of others, and nothing had ever challenged that redundant naï vete .<br>
<br>
Nobody he knew would have ever tried to take advantage of him.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's expression had grown stiff, so in order to try to relax her, Amane smiled and<br>
<br>
said, "Of course, I wasn't a total fool, so I never directly gave them any money or<br>
<br>
anything." But Mahiru's expression only got even more severe.<br>
<br>
"And then, well, I discovered that they were saying all sorts of things behind my back.<br>
<br>
They trashed my appearance. I heard them say I was gross and that they hated me and<br>
<br>
had only ever intended to take me for all I was worth from the very beginning. I was<br>
<br>
shocked and pretty depressed for a while."<br>
<br>
People all have different preferences when it comes to who they get along with, and<br>
<br>
Amane wouldn't have minded if they'd just said they didn't like him. But since they<br>
<br>
thought they could get something out of him, they had all smiled to his face and abused<br>
<br>
him in private, and that was something he couldn't bear.<br>
<br>
He had told Mahiru the mild version of the story, but there had also been insults that<br>
<br>
would be difficult to repeat, so he had really endured a lot. Now he would be able to<br>
<br>
shrug off abuse like that, but at the time, he had been an earnest and sensitive boy, and<br>
<br>
it had just been too much for him to bear.<br>
<br>
"Of course, I knew that not everybody in the world was like those guys. I had a few<br>
<br>
friends that I believe really liked me. Even so, once I started doubting people, fear took<br>
<br>
over. I couldn't trust anyone."<br>
<br>
He had shut himself up in his room for a while and cried.<br>
<br>
He had eventually recovered, thanks to his parents' support, but as one might expect,<br>
<br>
he was afraid to come into contact with those boys again, so he did every last possible<br>
<br>
thing to avoid them for as long as he could—<br>
<br>
"…And so I left my hometown. I left to get a fresh start in a place where no one knew<br>
<br>
me. I left so I wouldn't be bothered by those guys anymore."<br>
<br>
He hadn't known whether he could make it on his own, but he'd decided that his peace<br>
<br>
of mind was worth the risk.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everything that had happened, he could no longer easily trust people like<br>
<br>
he once had and had grown into an introverted and skeptical young man who had just<br>
<br>
finally managed to make two friends after taking ages to warm up to them. Amane had<br>
<br>
to laugh at himself. For better or worse, he had become quite conservative, but at this<br>
<br>
point, that attitude was deeply ingrained, and there was no changing it now.<br>
<br>
Amane had finished talking, and Mahiru was trembling. Her hands were balled into<br>
<br>
fists, and the emotion flickering in her eyes was unmistakably anger. Amane was<br>
<br>
surprised to see the mild-mannered Mahiru get so enraged, and then he was even<br>
<br>
more baffled when he realized that she was angry on his behalf, and that brought him 1<br>
<br>
a little joy.<br>
<br>
"…If I had been there, I would have punched those awful guys right in the face."<br>
<br>
"Please, no; you would just hurt your own hand… And you don't have to get your hands<br>
<br>
dirty for my sake, even in your imagination."<br>
<br>
Those jerks weren't worth Mahiru getting her hands dirty—not even close. And<br>
<br>
anyway, Amane had already cut them out of his life. It would be nothing but a waste<br>
<br>
for Mahiru to even bother with them.<br>
<br>
Mahiru relaxed a bit. She'd been squeezing her hands so hard they had started turning<br>
<br>
white. Some of the anger faded from her face, replaced by an even deeper look of<br>
<br>
sorrow.<br>
<br>
When it came to Amane, Mahiru could be so compassionate it almost hurt. But this<br>
<br>
incident was in the past, and Amane was embarrassed to have upset her over it.<br>
<br>
"Really, it wasn't as agonizing as your situation, so you don't have to be so sad."<br>
<br>
"Amane, it's not something that can be compared. I don't even want to try."<br>
<br>
She cut him off flatly, and Amane frowned when he realized that had been rude, but<br>
<br>
she looked at him and put on a calm expression.<br>
<br>
"Let me say this—it's not that there's no value in sharing our experiences, but your<br>
<br>
grief is your own, and it's something that only you can carry, and it can't be compared<br>
<br>
to my grief. Nothing is better or worse. In the truest sense, I can't understand your<br>
<br>
pain, Amane, nor can you understand mine."<br>
<br>
"…Ah."<br>
<br>
"What I can do is accept your sadness and support you… just like you've done for me.<br>
<br>
I want to be there for you, and I want you to rely on me." Mahiru whispered this as she<br>
<br>
placed the palms of her hands against both of Amane's cheeks.<br>
<br>
He gradually felt a heat rising from the depths of his chest and behind his eyes. "…But<br>
<br>
I already rely on you all the time," he said.<br>
<br>
"Emotionally, I mean."<br>
<br>
"I always rely on you."<br>
<br>
"…Well, do it more."<br>
<br>
"Don't spoil me, please."<br>
<br>
"I'm going to. So, so much."<br>
<br>
"I'm really not worth it." 1<br>
<br>
"Why are you worried about that now? I've always known you were a hopeless case,<br>
<br>
Amane."<br>
<br>
He felt himself grimace when she casually delivered this harsh and yet undeniable<br>
<br>
truth. But even though she sounded exasperated, Mahiru looked at him with gentle,<br>
<br>
loving eyes that communicated the opposite.<br>
<br>
"…But I also know you're a very good person, and you can endure a lot. Too much,<br>
<br>
even," she continued. "You can at least let me spoil you a little."<br>
<br>
Her sweet whispering voice, genuine and kind, threatened to obliterate what little<br>
<br>
resistance Amane had left. He could imagine himself letting her spoil him forever, and<br>
<br>
the thought struck a deep chord of fear within him, because he knew that if he let<br>
<br>
himself grow too dependent on the girl he deeply loved, nothing would ever seem as<br>
<br>
sweet.<br>
<br>
For the sake of preserving what little dignity he had left, Amane slowly shook his head.<br>
<br>
"Really, I'm fine," he insisted.<br>
<br>
Mahiru batted her eyes and sighed dramatically. "…You're trying to act cool again," she<br>
<br>
said wearily. "You big dummy."<br>
<br>
Mahiru mocked him sweetly, then slipped her hands from Amane's cheeks around to<br>
<br>
the back of his head. And then she pulled him toward her with all her strength.<br>
<br>
Before he could react, Amane's face was pressed up against Mahiru's chest. He froze.<br>
<br>
He could feel the softness of her skin and hear the beating of her heart, and when he<br>
<br>
inhaled, his lungs were filled with her sweet scent—a mix of milk and some kind of<br>
<br>
flower, with a little note of something bright, like green apple—and his mind was utter<br>
<br>
chaos.<br>
<br>
"Please, just let me spoil you," she said.<br>
<br>
"…You're really forward" was the best answer his addled brain could muster.<br>
<br>
But Mahiru's shoulders trembled with laughter. "Did you just realize that? Sometimes<br>
<br>
girls can be very pushy, you know," she whispered impishly.<br>
<br>
Fully aware of Amane's bewilderment, Mahiru gently wrapped her arms around his<br>
<br>
back so he couldn't get away. Of course, she was still a slim young woman, so if Amane<br>
<br>
wanted to shake free, he probably could have. However, the sweet scent and Mahiru's<br>
<br>
warmth, plus her pleasant softness and the calming rhythm of her heartbeat, sapped<br>
<br>
all of Amane's willpower to defy her.<br>
<br>
"…Besides, I'm the type of person who always repays a debt," she whispered. Amane<br>
<br>
had to fight to keep from losing himself in her warmth. "I relied on you before, Amane.<br>
<br>
You spoiled me, too, remember? And now it's my turn, all right? Let me spoil you back.<br>
<br>
It's the least I can do."<br>
<br>
"…It's more than enough."<br>
<br>
"Well then… Someday, when I'm feeling down again, you can be there for me, and that<br>
<br>
will make us even." Her tone of voice was playful, and it was clear she had no intention<br>
<br>
of giving up.<br>
<br>
Amane surrendered at last and leaned into Mahiru. But this time, he put his arm<br>
<br>
around her back and made sure to lean against her shoulder, instead of her chest. It<br>
<br>
was the best he could do.<br>
<br>
Mahiru smiled at Amane's choice, then tightly embraced him and accepted his full<br>
<br>
weight.<br>
<br>
"This isn't right…"<br>
<br>
Several dozen minutes had passed, though it felt like much longer for Amane. When<br>
<br>
he raised his head and pulled away from her, his voice was cold and had an edge. He<br>
<br>
wasn't angry at Mahiru, though. He was ashamed of himself, for taking advantage of<br>
<br>
her kindness.<br>
<br>
But Mahiru just smiled and showed no sign of concern. "Well, I do hate to see you<br>
<br>
feeling sad, so… next time I'll try to spoil you even sooner."<br>
<br>
"…That's not exactly what I meant…"<br>
<br>
Amane caught himself glancing down at her chest again. He quickly averted his eyes.<br>
<br>
She was being so kind to him, and he didn't want to be vulgar. He'd managed to keep<br>
<br>
himself in check this time, but next time, he thought, he might not be able to save<br>
<br>
himself so easily.<br>
<br>
Mahiru trusted Amane. She wouldn't have embraced him if she wasn't comfortable<br>
<br>
with him. But he was still somewhat surprised that she was being so insistent.<br>
<br>
And although her tenderness had eased the pain of his old wounds, that only left him<br>
<br>
free to focus on the new aching in his heart.<br>
<br>
"Why do you always turn away from me?" Mahiru asked.<br>
<br>
"I don't know what to do with myself when you spoil me like that. I mean, I am a guy,<br>
<br>
after all."<br>
<br>
"I know that…"<br>
<br>
"It's not clear that you do. Like, seriously."<br>
<br>
She should be more careful, he thought. What if he had taken advantage of her and<br>
<br>
rubbed his face wherever he pleased? What would she have done then? He wanted her<br>
<br>
to understand that there were some lines she shouldn't let even him cross.<br>
<br>
He wasn't confident he would be able to control himself the next time he was faced<br>
<br>
with the temptation of being given the go-ahead to bury his face in the chest of the girl<br>
<br>
he loved. Amane sighed. Mahiru was too trusting and would probably forgive him for<br>
<br>
almost anything.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's eyes narrowed. She looked absolutely hurt.<br>
<br>
"…Amane, I don't understand you at all."<br>
<br>
"What about me?"<br>
<br>
"Everything, all of it. You dummy."<br>
<br>
Mahiru stood up from the sofa in an angry huff. Even her insults sounded adorable.<br>
<br>
Leaving Amane to ponder her anger, she turned away and headed for the kitchen.<br>
<br>
He watched her leave in a daze. She looked so small and unsteady, but just a moment<br>
<br>
ago, she'd been supporting him.<br>
<br>
"Amane, you're such an airhead sometimes." She kept on rebuking him in a quiet, angry<br>
<br>
voice that she apparently didn't think he could hear, so Amane just watched her go<br>
<br>
with a shrug and a smile—<br>
<br>
"Even though I wouldn't do that for anyone but you."<br>
<br>
And then his ears picked up another quiet grumble.<br>
<br>
His breath caught in his throat.<br>
<br>
For a second, his brain refused to process her words. It was so shocking to him.<br>
<br>
He forced himself to take a shallow breath.<br>
<br>
And then the intense surge of emotion swirling in his chest practically forced Amane<br>
<br>
to his feet. He found himself reaching out toward her.<br>
<br>
"…Hey, Mahiru?"<br>
<br>
"What is… it?"<br>
<br>
Before she could turn around, Amane had wrapped Mahiru up in his arms, embracing 3<br>
<br>
her tightly as though he were shielding her from the world. Mahiru's slender frame<br>
<br>
began to tremble, and her voice wavered, but she didn't push him away or seem upset.<br>
<br>
He could tell she was shaking with surprise.<br>
<br>
Amane wrapped his arms around her delicate body. Just a moment ago, she had been<br>
<br>
supporting him. Now he put his chin on top of her head so she couldn't turn around.<br>
<br>
"…You didn't mind hugging from the front, but now that it's from behind, you're<br>
<br>
spooked," Amane teased.<br>
<br>
"Anyone would be surprised by being hugged so suddenly!"<br>
<br>
"You're the one who said I could lean on you. Though I held back because I knew this<br>
<br>
would happen… It's bad for my heart."<br>
<br>
Amane hadn't meant for this to happen. He was going to let Mahiru go off and pout, but<br>
<br>
when he'd heard what she'd said, he felt a sudden surge of emotion, embarrassment,<br>
<br>
and elation all at once, and reason left him—and his body had sought out Mahiru of<br>
<br>
its own accord.<br>
<br>
Gently, yet tightly, like he didn't want to let her slip away, he held on to Mahiru, who<br>
<br>
felt like she might shatter if he squeezed too hard.<br>
<br>
Mahiru tried to wriggle her way around to face him, but Amane whispered into her<br>
<br>
ear, "Don't turn around."<br>
<br>
She hung her head. Her face was bright red, and he heard her mutter, "…You dummy."<br>
<br>
…I am a dummy; you're absolutely right.<br>
<br>
He couldn't deny it. Here he was, taking advantage of her kindness in a vulnerable<br>
<br>
moment… He was certainly a bad person.<br>
<br>
But Mahiru hadn't pulled away from his touch, and he was grateful for that at least. He<br>
<br>
enjoyed her warmth as he pressed his face into her hair, just as she had done to him<br>
<br>
earlier, when she was trying to get him to accept her generosity. The difference<br>
<br>
between then and now, Amane thought, was that he knew how she would respond.<br>
<br>
"Now do you understand how I was feeling before?" he asked.<br>
<br>
"I—I do, but—"<br>
<br>
The shrillness in her voice told him she was upset. Her ears were red, and even though<br>
<br>
he couldn't actually tell from this angle, Amane had no doubt that her face had also<br>
<br>
turned the same intense color.<br>
<br>
Even Amane understood he had done something bad. He'd only done this because he<br>
<br>
had been sure she wouldn't turn him down.<br>
<br>
"…Um, so look. You really don't need to worry so much about me," he said. "It's not like<br>
<br>
I'm dying from some terrible condition or something. And besides, I can be pretty<br>
<br>
shameless, so if you spoil me too much, I'll end up taking advantage of your kindness."<br>
<br>
Mahiru listened quietly to Amane's words, then let out a sigh. "…If you find it satisfying,<br>
<br>
if it helps heal you, then I'm not going to refuse a hug."<br>
<br>
She reached up with one hand and gently touched him on the arm. She didn't brush<br>
<br>
him away or smack him; she simply placed her hand gently on his arm, as if to draw<br>
<br>
him closer. Amane warned himself not to get too carried away, but he still pressed his<br>
<br>
face into Mahiru's hair again.<br>
<br>
"I'm a crafty guy, you know. I knew you would accept the burden, so I started relying<br>
<br>
on you."<br>
<br>
"What are you talking about? I've always known you're trouble."<br>
<br>
Amane knew his recent actions had stemmed from his own cowardice, but he wasn't<br>
<br>
quite sure what she meant by trouble.<br>
<br>
"…I feel like there's something you want to say to me…"<br>
<br>
"Yes, if you have any self-awareness at all, then it's time to shape up and fly right. My<br>
<br>
heart really can't take any more of this." 1<br>
<br>
"I really don't have a clue what you're talking about," Amane protested.<br>
<br>
"Mm-hmm," Mahiru hummed, then slapped Amane on the arm. It didn't hurt, and he<br>
<br>
laughed quietly at her playful attack.<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry for being so much trouble."<br>
<br>
"…Well, if you're going to be trouble anyway, you might as well go all the way."<br>
<br>
"But… What you were saying earlier…"<br>
<br>
"That was that, and this is this."<br>
<br>
"Oh…?"<br>
<br>
He wasn't sure what Mahiru meant, but she certainly seemed to have something in<br>
<br>
mind, so far be it from Amane to argue.<br>
<br>
If Mahiru thought he seemed troublesome, then he probably was. But he didn't know<br>
<br>
how to respond when she told him to up the ante.<br>
<br>
"I can be crafty, too, you know," Mahiru said. "So I suppose I really don't have much<br>
<br>
room to complain."<br>
<br>
"In what way, Mahiru?"<br>
<br>
"Hmm, I wonder?"<br>
<br>
He felt her body tremble slightly with laughter.<br>
<br>
"If you haven't realized yet that I also have a few tricks up my sleeve, you still have a<br>
<br>
long way to go, Amane." 1<br>
<br>
Even though Amane couldn't see her face, it was clear she was laughing gleefully.<br>
<br>
Gracefully, she slipped out of his arms and whirled around to face him.<br>
<br>
Her expression when she did was vibrant, and mischievous, and tender, and sweet—<br>
<br>
a lovely and beautiful smile that would enchant anyone who saw it. Amane was<br>
<br>
speechless.<br>
<br>
When she saw Amane like that, Mahiru seemed satisfied, and she turned and headed<br>
<br>
for the kitchen in her usual high spirits.<br>
<br>
Amane watched her leave the room and then collapsed onto the sofa.<br>
<br>
…You're a big dummy, too, you know.<br>
<br>
What was she trying to do, flashing him a look like that? He didn't think he could string<br>
<br>
together the words to ask her. All he could do was sit there, grumbling quietly.<br>
<br>
But the pain in the depths of his chest was gone.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 38: Parental Concern and a Passing Pain<br>
<br>
…Mom, you can't just send Mahiru photos like that."<br>
<br>
On the last day of Golden Week, Amane phoned his mother.<br>
<br>
He was ostensibly calling to ask whether she would be at home on Mother's Day, but<br>
<br>
before he could do that, he felt the need to stress his objection to her going behind his<br>
<br>
back to send Mahiru photos of him. Nothing disastrous had slipped through the cracks<br>
<br>
just yet, but this was his mother he was dealing with, and he knew if Mahiru asked,<br>
<br>
she would absolutely send something mortifying.<br>
<br>
So Amane rushed through the typical greetings and right into sullenly hurling<br>
<br>
accusations.<br>
<br>
"Uh-oh, you caught me," his mother replied in an indifferent tone.<br>
<br>
She definitely was not remorseful.<br>
<br>
"Mahiru was acting suspicious, so I questioned her, and then I saw the photos."<br>
<br>
"Mahiru really needs to work on her poker face, huh?"<br>
<br>
"Say you're sorry for sending them."<br>
<br>
Thanks to Shihoko, Mahiru's image folder was full of all kinds of strange pictures, and<br>
<br>
he was worried what else might make its way to her. For some reason, Mahiru seemed<br>
<br>
to enjoy the photos, and rather than forcing her to stop looking at them, he had<br>
<br>
decided it would be faster to go right to the root of the problem.<br>
<br>
But his mother didn't seem the least bit ashamed. "What's so wrong about sending<br>
<br>
photos of my adorable son to my adorable future daughter-in-law?"<br>
<br>
"I don't even know where to start correcting everything wrong with that sentence…<br>
<br>
Anyway, don't send stuff I haven't okayed."<br>
<br>
"So if I get your permission, it's fine, right? The photos made Mahiru very happy, you<br>
<br>
know."<br>
<br>
"At least give me a chance to choose which ones you can send. I'd die if I found out<br>
<br>
you'd sent anything embarrassing."<br>
<br>
"Don't worry, I won't send any pictures of you in the bath."<br>
<br>
"If you do, I'm boycotting Mother's Day." Amane scowled at his smartphone as he<br>
<br>
delivered his ultimatum. His mother wasn't on hand to feel his wrath directly, so that<br>
<br>
would have to do.<br>
<br>
She obviously did not appreciate how upset he was, because she laughed gaily at his<br>
<br>
demand. Before Amane could raise his eyebrows and go off on her again, she added,<br>
<br>
"One way or another, you always show your appreciation for me every year, don't you?"<br>
<br>
When Amane heard that, he held back his complaints.<br>
<br>
"…I mean, yeah, you're my mom."<br>
<br>
Of course, she could be irritating and obstinate, and sometimes he got completely fed<br>
<br>
up with her, but his mother had carried him in her belly, given birth to him, lovingly<br>
<br>
raised him to be healthy—and she did it all with plenty of love, so naturally he was<br>
<br>
grateful to her.<br>
<br>
Thanks to his parents, Amane had grown up okay and had rebounded whenever he'd<br>
<br>
gotten hurt. He had turned out a little sulky, though.<br>
<br>
But since it was embarrassing for a young man of his age to express gratitude directly<br>
<br>
to his mother's face, he faltered a little.<br>
<br>
His mother laughed cheerfully, as if she could see straight through her son. "It makes<br>
<br>
a mother happy to see that she's raised a good child. I'm looking forward to this year's<br>
<br>
flowers."<br>
<br>
"…Yeah."<br>
<br>
"Also, make sure you invite sweet Mahiru here for the summer, okay? I'm looking<br>
<br>
forward to it."<br>
<br>
His mother was obviously excited for his homecoming.<br>
<br>
"Got it," Amane replied curtly, and he was treated to another laugh. "Well, Mahiru wants<br>
<br>
to come anyway," he continued. "It seems like she's looking forward to it as well."<br>
<br>
"It sounds like you are, too, Amane."<br>
<br>
"Oh, be quiet."<br>
<br>
He was excited about the prospect of spending the summer with Mahiru, but he didn't<br>
<br>
appreciate being teased about it by his own mother.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Amane was in a bad mood, but Shihoko didn't seem to notice. On the other<br>
<br>
end of the line, he could hear the peals of her cheerful laughter.<br>
<br>
"Heh-heh. That's great. It sounds like you're okay with the idea of returning home."<br>
<br>
"…I guess so."<br>
<br>
She was probably thinking of the summer after his first year away, when he had<br>
<br>
resisted going home during the break.<br>
<br>
Now Amane was more positive about going home than he had once been. It wasn't<br>
<br>
that he had forgotten the past. Even though he had experienced certain hardships, he<br>
<br>
could see now that it had probably been for the best. Things were much better than<br>
<br>
they would have been if he had stayed so trusting and good-natured, thus inevitably<br>
<br>
exploited for all he was worth. More importantly, if he hadn't escaped those guys, he<br>
<br>
never would have met Mahiru.<br>
<br>
"If I let what happened derail my life any more than it already has, Mahiru would kill<br>
<br>
me. So yeah, it pretty much doesn't bother me anymore."<br>
<br>
"You told Mahiru?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah."<br>
<br>
"That's wonderful. That's one more person who really understands you."<br>
<br>
His mother sounded very happy, and Amane felt his chest grow just a little bit warm.<br>
<br>
"…Sure."<br>
<br>
"So that must mean those photos of you from middle school I had held back on sending<br>
<br>
are fair game. I've got one from when you hit your growth spurt. You looked so smug<br>
<br>
because you'd gotten taller than me. And that's just the beginning!"<br>
<br>
"Hey, listen, I'm not kidding. Cut it out, all right? You've got some awful stuff in reserve."<br>
<br>
All the warm feelings he'd had toward his mother evaporated.<br>
<br>
"But you were so cuuute!"<br>
<br>
"Dammit. This time, when I come home, I'm taking those out of the album."<br>
<br>
"I've got that album hidden," Shihoko countered. "So they'll be fine."<br>
<br>
"I'm definitely going to find it," he insisted.<br>
<br>
He had to dispose of the photos before Mahiru saw them. He could just imagine Mahiru<br>
<br>
grinning as she told him what she thought of them after his mother smuggled them<br>
<br>
into her hands behind his back.<br>
<br>
He could hear Shihoko laughing at him on the other end of the line, and with a curt<br>
<br>
good-bye, he hung up on her, sighing angrily.<br>
<br>
"…What are you doing?" a quiet voice asked. He turned to see Mahiru, peeking<br>
<br>
inquisitively at him from the living room door. It looked like she had heard him talking<br>
<br>
and tried not to make any noise as she entered the apartment.<br>
<br>
Amane averted his eyes. "I was talking to my mom, telling her how I've decided to<br>
<br>
completely destroy her photo albums. Scorched earth."<br>
<br>
"Wh-what do you mean?! That'd be awful!" she exclaimed. She sat down next to him<br>
<br>
in an angry huff and jabbed him in the shoulder.<br>
<br>
Amane grimaced. "What are you even hoping to see, Mahiru…?"<br>
<br>
"Photos of you, from long ago, of course…"<br>
<br>
"No way."<br>
<br>
"…You see? I have no choice but to get them from Shihoko, behind your back."<br>
<br>
"Hey, listen—"<br>
<br>
"I'm just joking. Well, half joking anyway."<br>
<br>
"Geez… It's the other half that worries me, you know."<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't help but feel like if he dropped the matter, Mahiru would end up<br>
<br>
plotting something with his mother behind his back. On the other hand, Mahiru was a<br>
<br>
good person, and he trusted that, whatever happened, she wouldn't do anything too<br>
<br>
outrageous.<br>
<br>
Amane sighed dramatically, but Mahiru didn't seem bothered by it. Instead, she smiled<br>
<br>
broadly, looking pleased. "…I don't think you're going to like this much, but I'm really<br>
<br>
looking forward to summer vacation."<br>
<br>
"You're kinda early," Amane replied. "Golden Week isn't even over yet."<br>
<br>
"Well… I'm looking forward to seeing your mother and father again, and I can't wait to<br>
<br>
check out your photo album, and I really want to see the place where you grew up with<br>
<br>
my own eyes."<br>
<br>
Amane felt his heart leap as she adorably rattled off her list, but she had added in one<br>
<br>
item too many.<br>
<br>
"Thanks… except for the album thing. The album is off-limits."<br>
<br>
Mahiru gave him a peevish look when he shut her down, so he stroked her head to<br>
<br>
distract her from the existence of the cursed photo album.<br>
<br>
Mahiru apparently liked having her head stroked more than he had ever expected. She<br>
<br>
still looked a tiny bit dissatisfied, but when he gently touched the top layer of her hair,<br>
<br>
careful not to mess it up, she quickly settled down.<br>
<br>
"…I'm looking forward to going home, too," Amane admitted.<br>
<br>
"Really?" she asked.<br>
<br>
"Why would I lie about that?"<br>
<br>
"…I mean, with everything that happened…" Mahiru hesitated, probably recalling what<br>
<br>
he had revealed to her yesterday.<br>
<br>
"That thing with those guys doesn't really bother me anymore. Just the fact that you're<br>
<br>
upset about something that happened to me really means a lot. How do I put this—? I<br>
<br>
think I'm a pretty lucky guy to have someone who's willing to get genuinely angry on<br>
<br>
my behalf."<br>
<br>
He knew it was a small, simple thing, but just having someone who listened to him talk<br>
<br>
about those old wounds—and be there to support him—had already gone a long way<br>
<br>
toward helping him heal.<br>
<br>
Besides, it was clear he couldn't carry on being depressed about it. Sooner or later, he<br>
<br>
would exhaust Mahiru's patience with him, and he didn't want her to think he was<br>
<br>
completely hopeless.<br>
<br>
"It's only natural that I would be angry you were hurt, Amane. I mean, if someone was<br>
<br>
to hurt me, you would be angry, right?"<br>
<br>
"Of course I would."<br>
<br>
"So it's the same thing," Mahiru asserted softly, letting her eyes drift closed. Amane<br>
<br>
could tell how much she enjoyed it when he stroked her hair.<br>
<br>
Amane felt a little embarrassed by how much she trusted him, but he continued gently<br>
<br>
caressing her, and she smiled graciously and leaned against him.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 39: A Premonition of Trouble After the Holidays<br>
<br>
Golden Week, which had seemed both very long and painfully short, eventually came<br>
<br>
to a close, and school began again.<br>
<br>
…Finally, I can get some distance from Mahiru.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had spent nearly the entire Golden Week at Amane's apartment. He'd said it<br>
<br>
was okay, was grateful she had made their delicious meals, and was happy to spend<br>
<br>
time with the girl he loved.<br>
<br>
But ever since the day Amane had told Mahiru about his troubled past, his feelings for<br>
<br>
her had only grown, and now he found it almost impossible to calm his turbulent<br>
<br>
emotions.<br>
<br>
Mahiru trusted Amane wholeheartedly. She spoiled him, certainly, but in a way she<br>
<br>
also took advantage of him, testing the limits of his emotional fortitude. And knowing<br>
<br>
he was the only one allowed to touch her sent his feelings into overdrive.<br>
<br>
Really, he thought, I deserve some kind of award for self-control. If only I didn't have to<br>
<br>
hold back, I bet I could ask her out. I might even get a good answer—<br>
<br>
Mahiru had been so accepting of Amane, but he knew he didn't have the guts to tell<br>
<br>
her how he felt. Just the thought of her rejection made him want to curl up and die. He<br>
<br>
knew he was a coward, too afraid to make a move. But perhaps he was even more<br>
<br>
afraid of what might happen if she didn't reject him, if by some chance she felt the<br>
<br>
same way about him. He didn't think he was good enough to be her boyfriend.<br>
<br>
…I've got a lot of work to do.<br>
<br>
There wasn't anything he could do about his face, but he wanted to improve himself<br>
<br>
wherever he could—physically and mentally. At least enough so no one would talk<br>
<br>
behind their backs when he was with her—enough so Mahiru wouldn't be ashamed<br>
<br>
of being with him.<br>
<br>
And even if it turned out Mahiru didn't like him that way, it didn't hurt to try. He'd<br>
<br>
never get anywhere if he didn't give it his best.<br>
<br>
As he made up his mind to ask Yuuta, the lean, athletic track-and-field star, for some<br>
<br>
training recommendations, Amane passed through the school gates and reached the<br>
<br>
shoe lockers, where he caught sight of a familiar face.<br>
<br>
"Mornin'…" Itsuki was groggily changing into his indoor slippers. He gave a puzzled<br>
<br>
frown when he saw Amane. "…What's with that face?"<br>
<br>
"That's my line," Amane said. "And anyway, what face?"<br>
<br>
"Well, umm… How do I put this? You look like you've made a big decision. You finally<br>
<br>
decide to tell her how you feel?"<br>
<br>
Amane gave Itsuki an incredulous look. "Hmph. Yeah, right!" But his friend hadn't been<br>
<br>
that far off the mark.<br>
<br>
Itsuki stared at him with genuine curiosity. "Huh, well then, what is it? I thought there<br>
<br>
would have been some kind of progress by now."<br>
<br>
"P-progress? All right, look—"<br>
<br>
"I was sure you'd finally grown a pair and decided to approach her like a man for a<br>
<br>
change."<br>
<br>
"Damn, no need to be an ass! Anyway… I was just thinking about how I have a lot of<br>
<br>
work to do if I'm ever gonna get her to like me back."<br>
<br>
"Hmm. In other words, over the break, after we went to karaoke… something did<br>
<br>
happen! You're really going for it, eh?!" Itsuki chuckled.<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't think of a clever comeback.<br>
<br>
Itsuki slapped his friend on the back as he laughed. "Well, I know you hate me prying,<br>
<br>
so I'll let you off the hook… But if there's anything I can help you with, I will, okay?"<br>
<br>
"Itsuki…"<br>
<br>
"And we can think about double dates, okay?"<br>
<br>
"Ah, so that's what you're really after," Amane joked. He knew Itsuki was only trying to<br>
<br>
lighten the mood.<br>
<br>
Itsuki cackled and smacked Amane's back again. "Yeah, that's the dream, huh…?" 1<br>
<br>
Humor was Itsuki's way of cheering him up.<br>
<br>
Amane smiled at his friend, feeling just a little bit more optimistic. "Whatever you say,<br>
<br>
man."<br>
<br>
When Amane and Itsuki reached their classroom, there was some kind of clamor going<br>
<br>
on. The commotion wasn't directed at the two of them, but the lively atmosphere was<br>
<br>
so different from normal that Amane couldn't hide his bewilderment.<br>
<br>
After a long break, it was normal for the classroom to be bustling with stories of<br>
<br>
vacation, but today it was filled with a different kind of noise—the bustle of people<br>
<br>
passing rumors. Amane strained his ears to listen in as he unloaded his bags at his<br>
<br>
seat—and it seemed they were all discussing Mahiru.<br>
<br>
"I heard that Shiina went on a date the other day with a cool-looking guy!"<br>
<br>
What he overheard made Amane's cheek twitch violently.<br>
<br>
They'd gone to crowded places, so there had always been a possibility that someone<br>
<br>
would see them. But Amane had never imagined it would literally become the talk of<br>
<br>
the classroom. He didn't mind the part about looking cool, but the rest of it immediately<br>
<br>
set him on edge.<br>
<br>
Itsuki had obviously overheard the same thing and was sitting there doing a very bad<br>
<br>
job of not smiling. Amane would have liked to give him a good punch in the arm.<br>
<br>
As they whispered about the rumors, all the girls kept glancing over at Mahiru.<br>
<br>
"I heard they were strolling around arm in arm, and she was wearing a smile no one's<br>
<br>
ever seen at school before… It must have been the guy everyone was talking about at<br>
<br>
the start of the year."<br>
<br>
"She says she's not dating anyone, but there's no doubt now…"<br>
<br>
Mahiru, who had come to school early, as always, was preparing for first period. She<br>
<br>
either didn't realize the rumors were about her, or more likely, she did realize and was<br>
<br>
trying to ignore them.<br>
<br>
She had to be used to the attention, thanks to her beauty and grace, but that day there<br>
<br>
were more than the usual number of eyes peering in her direction, filled with<br>
<br>
questions. And aside from the curious stares of the girls, she was getting looks of dead<br>
<br>
despair from the boys.<br>
<br>
If it bothered Mahiru, she certainly didn't show it. She stubbornly maintained her<br>
<br>
usual angelic demeanor.<br>
<br>
Eventually, a few of the girls in the class couldn't contain their curiosity any longer and<br>
<br>
gingerly approached her.<br>
<br>
"Hey, hey, Shiina?" one of the girls asked timidly.<br>
<br>
Mahiru slowly batted her eyes. "Yes, did you need something?" She was acting like she<br>
<br>
had no idea what the girls wanted.<br>
<br>
"Well, the other day, I think I saw you walking through the shopping mall with a guy."<br>
<br>
"Yes, I did walk through the mall," Mahiru confirmed.<br>
<br>
A wave of murmuring went through the class. Obviously, everyone had been wondering<br>
<br>
if the rumors were true. Amane, at the center of the scandal, felt sick to his stomach.<br>
<br>
"Um, so that guy… What kind of relationship…?"<br>
<br>
"What kind of relationship do we have?" Mahiru interrupted. "Well, if I had to say, I<br>
<br>
think calling us friends would describe it best."<br>
<br>
Amane was glad Mahiru had answered honestly, but his stomach still felt like it was<br>
<br>
tied in knots. His classmates continued to mutter among themselves. He wished they<br>
<br>
would all just mind their own business, but there was little he could do about it. Several<br>
<br>
of the other boys in class seemed very relieved by Mahiru's answer, undoubtedly for<br>
<br>
different reasons than Amane.<br>
<br>
"So it wasn't a date or anything?"<br>
<br>
"A date…?" Mahiru thought for a moment. "Well, when I consider the definition of a<br>
<br>
date, I think it counts."<br>
<br>
It was not the answer he had been expecting. In the strictest sense, a date was when<br>
<br>
two or more people picked a place and time to meet up, so she wasn't exactly wrong…<br>
<br>
But it was pretty obvious that was not what the girls had meant.<br>
<br>
The small crowd shrieked as their excitement peaked.<br>
<br>
From Amane's perspective, it seemed like since time immemorial, girls loved getting<br>
<br>
excited about other people's love affairs. Normally he didn't concern himself with that<br>
<br>
kind of chatter, figuring it was just what girls did. But this time, he couldn't ignore their<br>
<br>
gossip—because he was at the center of it.<br>
<br>
"S-so what are you saying…?"<br>
<br>
The same girl who had asked the previous questions inquired again. Her voice<br>
<br>
trembled with a mix of curiosity and hope.<br>
<br>
Mahiru glanced at Amane for a split second. That look, gentle but filled with hints of<br>
<br>
passion, left him momentarily breathless. By the time he got ahold of himself, Mahiru<br>
<br>
had already turned away.<br>
<br>
Now Mahiru wore a gentle smile, full of warmth and affection, and clasped her hands<br>
<br>
in front of her breast, as if she were tightly holding on to something very precious. Her<br>
<br>
answer sent the class into chaos, and it shook Amane to his core.<br>
<br>
"We're not dating, but to me… he is the most important person on earth."<br>

Chapter 40: The Angel’s Thoughts<br>
<br>
"We're not dating, but to me… he is the most important person on earth."<br>
<br>
Mahiru had made that statement publicly, in front of their classmates. For the rest of<br>
<br>
the day, Amane couldn't think about anything else or pay attention in class. He just<br>
<br>
didn't know exactly what she'd meant by "important." Did she mean that they were<br>
<br>
good friends, or affectionately close, or maybe—in a romantic sense? 1<br>
<br>
The more he thought about it, the more anxiety and unease he felt, but the faintest<br>
<br>
hope swirled in his chest. All day, he was overwhelmed by emotions he could not put<br>
<br>
into words.<br>
<br>
His friend Itsuki smiled at him, but didn't make any jokes or say anything about it.<br>
<br>
Amane had little hope of figuring out what Mahiru was thinking on his own. He spent<br>
<br>
the whole day irritated, wishing he could just ask her directly what she'd meant. But<br>
<br>
he never got the chance at school.<br>
<br>
When the two of them got back to Amane's apartment, he finally, timidly, asked<br>
<br>
Mahiru.<br>
<br>
She looked at him with a puzzled expression. "I wasn't lying, you know," she said<br>
<br>
without hesitation. It sounded like she had no idea why he was asking.<br>
<br>
Mahiru put on her apron to prepare dinner. She also put on a little smile, perhaps<br>
<br>
aware of Amane's discomfort. "I'm fairly sociable, but my circle of friends is small. The<br>
<br>
only people I can definitely say I'm close with are you, Chitose, and Akazawa. Of course,<br>
<br>
all of you are important to me, but among the three of you, you're the one I'm closest<br>
<br>
with and the one I feel most at ease with when we're together."<br>
<br>
"Oh, um…"<br>
<br>
Amane knew that what Mahiru was saying was true, but being told this face-to-face<br>
<br>
felt very strange for some reason.<br>
<br>
"We've spent the past half year or so together, and it has been a very meaningful time<br>
<br>
for me. I've never been the type to get close to others, and you're the most comfortable,<br>
<br>
most likable person I know," she said calmly and candidly.<br>
<br>
Amane suppressed a groan as he looked into Mahiru's gentle eyes. She gazed back at<br>
<br>
him.<br>
<br>
"For me, the world is a small place," she continued. "I could count the people I like on<br>
<br>
one hand, as if I'm living in a miniature garden… In my little world, you are the most<br>
<br>
precious person to me. You're the one who told me that I'm okay just the way I am."<br>
<br>
"Mahiru…"<br>
<br>
"So I want you to be a little more confident in that regard, Amane."<br>
<br>
Mahiru's cheeks reddened, coloring her shy expression, clearly showing that she was<br>
<br>
stating her true feelings, but Mahiru didn't seem to notice.<br>
<br>
The sincerity painted on her face caused conflicting emotions to well up inside<br>
<br>
Amane—embarrassment and indescribable joy threatened to make his chest burst.<br>
<br>
"After all, you already know that I trust you above anyone else. Did you think that there<br>
<br>
was someone else that I liked?"<br>
<br>
"That's not it, but… when you put it that way, you must have known how I would take<br>
<br>
it, right?"<br>
<br>
"That's exactly right," Mahiru answered with an unwavering smile.<br>
<br>
Amane stared at Mahiru. "So when you dodged the question that way, you knew it<br>
<br>
would open us up to insistent prying and suspicions of romance?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru's smile broadened. She was oddly nonchalant. "That's also right."<br>
<br>
"In that case, wouldn't it have been easier to manage the rumors by letting out a few<br>
<br>
snippets of information at a slow trickle? If people are going to speculate, I think it<br>
<br>
would be better to at least have some control over the direction the rumors take."<br>
<br>
"…Indeed."<br>
<br>
Amane knew that Mahiru had her own ways of thinking about these things, but to him,<br>
<br>
it had been extraordinarily nerve-racking to hear her talk about him in public, even<br>
<br>
indirectly.<br>
<br>
In the end, there had been a big uproar after her statement, but Mahiru herself had<br>
<br>
just calmly put on her angelic smile. The boys in love with Mahiru were probably<br>
<br>
stressing out about it right now.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, you should be more careful. If you don't say anything to me beforehand, I<br>
<br>
might get the wrong idea, too."<br>
<br>
"Get the wrong idea?"<br>
<br>
"…Usually, if someone said something like that about me, I'd think what everyone else<br>
<br>
is thinking."<br>
<br>
Amane figured that Mahiru must like him in some way. Otherwise, she wouldn't be so<br>
<br>
relaxed around him, or look at him with such trust in her eyes. But he couldn't figure<br>
<br>
out the exact nature of her affection.<br>
<br>
Was it the same kind of sentiment that Amane felt toward Mahiru, or was it something<br>
<br>
more passionate?<br>
<br>
The feelings he held were not something that he could easily put into words.<br>
<br>
He didn't feel burning-hot passion, and it wasn't intense, heartrending yearning,<br>
<br>
either. It was more like a quiet, gentle candle giving off a steady heat. Mahiru was the<br>
<br>
first person for whom his heart had felt such affection and desire to treasure.<br>
<br>
However, those weren't the kind of feelings that most friends of the opposite sex could<br>
<br>
just openly talk about. Also, Amane didn't know if Mahiru felt the same way. For this<br>
<br>
reason, he reminded himself to speak clearly, so as not to be misunderstood.<br>
<br>
"I mean, if for example I were to announce that you were someone important to me,<br>
<br>
with that kind of timing, you'd start getting ideas too, right?"<br>
<br>
"But I don't think you would ever make such a declaration in the first place, Amane."<br>
<br>
"Well, that's true, but—"<br>
<br>
"Or are you saying that's what you're going to do?"<br>
<br>
"I know that if I did, I'd wind up feeling like I decided to sit down on a bed of thorns."<br>
<br>
I know for sure that people's thorny gazes would skewer me—no, they'd eviscerate me. I<br>
<br>
would die by a thousand stares.<br>
<br>
Amane waved his hand in front of his face. He had no intention of resigning himself to<br>
<br>
such a fate without any sort of preparation.<br>
<br>
Mahiru let a little giggle slip out.<br>
<br>
"I know you're not the risk-taking type."<br>
<br>
"…Somehow, I feel like that annoys you."<br>
<br>
"You're imagining things."<br>
<br>
Amane was pretty sure he was not imagining the look of exasperation on Mahiru's<br>
<br>
face, but it seemed she didn't feel like explaining anything to him.<br>
<br>
Mahiru let out a deep sigh, as if to vent her frustrations, and headed for the kitchen.<br>
<br>
"…Um?"<br>
<br>
"What is it?"<br>
<br>
"If I did make some kind of public declaration, I think it would have a big effect on your<br>
<br>
life, too… Are you prepared for that?"<br>
<br>
"What a silly question. I would never suggest something if I wasn't ready to deal with<br>
<br>
the consequences."<br>
<br>
Amane was at a loss for words because she really said it without a second thought.<br>
<br>
Mahiru didn't so much as look his way and started setting out her cooking utensils<br>
<br>
with a flourish of her apron hem.<br>
<br>
"I understand that my social standing is different from yours, and that we receive very<br>
<br>
different kinds of attention. I also understand that you won't say anything. And I don't<br>
<br>
want to make you uncomfortable."<br>
<br>
"…That's—"<br>
<br>
"It's a real pain to be popular, you know. People are always watching how you act in<br>
<br>
public and meddling in your affairs."<br>
<br>
Mahiru grumbled to herself, and it was plain to see she was fed up with the attention.<br>
<br>
Then she turned around to look at Amane.<br>
<br>
"But here, it's just the two of us; there's no one to butt in. For now, I'm satisfied with<br>
<br>
that."<br>
<br>
Mahiru smiled coyly, and Amane couldn't do anything but stare at her beautiful smile,<br>
<br>
unable to say anything more.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 41: The Angel’s Risky Proposal<br>
<br>
A new day had dawned since Mahiru's shocking statement, but the excitement over<br>
<br>
the angel's new relationship hadn't settled down at all in class.<br>
<br>
Her words had attracted considerable curiosity, since up to now, she hadn't shown any<br>
<br>
interest in boys and had treated members of both sexes the same.<br>
<br>
However, no matter what she was asked, Mahiru didn't answer with any additional<br>
<br>
information. Her closest friend, Chitose, also insisted that she didn't know anything,<br>
<br>
so whoever Mahiru had alluded to remained unknown.<br>
<br>
As the boy in question, Amane was relieved by this, but at the same time, he was<br>
<br>
terrified, wondering when he would be exposed.<br>
<br>
"Well, I think if someone got a reeeally good look at your face, they'd figure it out. But<br>
<br>
from a distance, just looking at your silhouette, I doubt anyone would recognize you,"<br>
<br>
Itsuki said, laughing at Amane's concern as he looked over the merchandise for sale.<br>
<br>
Amane had brought Itsuki and Yuuta along with him to the sports equipment store. 3<br>
<br>
He was there to buy some exercise gear, after deciding that he should start training<br>
<br>
and exercising to better complement Mahiru, and so that she might fall for him. The<br>
<br>
impact of her statement had sparked the idea.<br>
<br>
Club activities were suspended for the time being due to upcoming exams, so the track<br>
<br>
and field club ace had some free time and accompanied Amane to help him pick out<br>
<br>
running shoes.<br>
<br>
"I mean, after all, you usually have a plain hairstyle and act all indifferent, so you come<br>
<br>
off as cold, and your expression doesn't really change," Itsuki said. "But when you're<br>
<br>
with her, you make all sorts of faces, and you actually look up from the ground, so you<br>
<br>
seem sweet and gentle. I don't think anyone would connect that guy with the Amane<br>
<br>
we see at school."<br>
<br>
"You're pretty easy to read, Fujimiya; it's surprising," Yuuta added.<br>
<br>
"Shut up."<br>
<br>
Amane was aware that he acted more gently toward Mahiru than other people, but it<br>
<br>
was still embarrassing to hear someone point it out like that.<br>
<br>
It was all the more humiliating to know that even Yuuta, who he had just started<br>
<br>
hanging out with, could see it.<br>
<br>
Amane frowned, trying to shake off the embarrassment. Itsuki looked at him with a<br>
<br>
foolish grin.<br>
<br>
"Looks like my prediction was right, that you would change when you found a girl you<br>
<br>
liked."<br>
<br>
"…Shut up."<br>
<br>
"Oooh, you are sooo cute when you're trying not to look embarrassed, Amane!"<br>
<br>
"Don't be a creep, Itsuki."<br>
<br>
"It is a little creepy, Itsuki."<br>
<br>
"Why are you on his side, Yuuta? You're supposed to stick with me."<br>
<br>
"Well, it's… you know."<br>
<br>
"I'm gonna cry, guys."<br>
<br>
Itsuki did not seem like he was going to cry at all. After grinning and poking at Amane<br>
<br>
for a while, he shrugged. "Well, I guess she really does have all sorts of troubles of her<br>
<br>
own, huh? Including yesterday's performance."<br>
<br>
"…Performance? She told me she did it to control the rumors as best she could without<br>
<br>
telling any lies, since she was under suspicion anyway."<br>
<br>
"Ah, is that how she explained it? Well, that's all true, but I think it was also an attempt<br>
<br>
to repel other guys without inviting hostility from other girls. When you're popular,<br>
<br>
you're always the object of jealousy, more or less. By hinting that she's got a special<br>
<br>
someone, and that she hasn't got eyes for anyone else, she's saying that even if she<br>
<br>
hangs around Yuuta and us once in a while, she's not interested."<br>
<br>
"I see."<br>
<br>
"Plus, you know, to keep it all in check."<br>
<br>
"What do you mean?"<br>
<br>
"…Ah, it's nothing. Forget it. Setting all that aside, I can see in your eyes that she's<br>
<br>
important to you, and I think she probably feels the same way. You can win her over if<br>
<br>
you push, or even better, push her down, heh? It's important for a guy to take a little<br>
<br>
initiative, you know!"<br>
<br>
The words "push her down" made Amane recall the situation that happened over<br>
<br>
Golden Week.<br>
<br>
I didn't mean to…<br>
<br>
By accident, he had lost his balance and fallen on top of her. It wasn't anything<br>
<br>
intentional. There was no way he would have done it on purpose, being fully aware<br>
<br>
that Mahiru would hate him if he did something as outrageous as that.<br>
<br>
However, if Mahiru made the same expression next time, looking like she was waiting<br>
<br>
for him to make some sort of move—he wasn't sure what he'd do then.<br>
<br>
"…Hey, did something happen that I don't know about? Did you get lucky or<br>
<br>
something?"<br>
<br>
Itsuki made a grabbing motion with his hands, very interested now that Amane's<br>
<br>
cheeks were gradually flushing with remembered shame.<br>
<br>
"Just shut up for once!" Amane shouted.<br>
<br>
"Itsuki, you're the worst!" Yuuta added.<br>
<br>
"Whose side are you on, anyway?! I thought you were hoping for progress, Yuuta!"<br>
<br>
"I don't want to be on your side when you're messing around like that. Though I do<br>
<br>
think that Fujimiya is being too passive."<br>
<br>
"As far as I can tell, you're both against me."<br>
<br>
Amane had complex feelings about getting these evaluations from Yuuta and Itsuki.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, he knew he wasn't particularly assertive, so he didn't feel like he<br>
<br>
could make much of a rebuttal.<br>
<br>
"Now, now, we just wanted to give you a little nudge," Yuuta insisted. "I don't know<br>
<br>
Mahiru that well, so I'm just speculating, but I doubt she has feelings for anyone other<br>
<br>
than you, Fujimiya. It seems like you're the only one she really trusts. After all, she<br>
<br>
seems incredibly wary of most people. I'm telling you, the way that girl looks at you,<br>
<br>
and only you, is different."<br>
<br>
"…I know that she trusts me, and that she likes me as a person, but even so…"<br>
<br>
"Why are you so negative? Have some confidence. You're a good guy, and you seem like<br>
<br>
the kind of person who can put in some serious effort, so long as you have a goal. I<br>
<br>
mean, look, if you really don't have any confidence, then start working out and get in<br>
<br>
shape. Physical fitness is linked to emotional well-being, you know. If your body gets<br>
<br>
fitter, your attitude should improve, and if your attitude improves, everything around<br>
<br>
you will look brighter. By getting physically stronger, you can make yourself more<br>
<br>
confident."<br>
<br>
"You sound awfully self-assured."<br>
<br>
"I read it in a book."<br>
<br>
Yuuta seemed amused at reciting something he saw in a book once and passing it off<br>
<br>
as if speaking from his own experience. He laughed playfully and clapped Amane on<br>
<br>
the shoulder. "Well, you're tall, Fujimiya, so you'd look good if you filled out a little,<br>
<br>
looked a little more balanced, you know? It would be a waste not to cultivate the good<br>
<br>
features you were born with."<br>
<br>
"…I'll try my best."<br>
<br>
"You've got Yuuta to help you with the physical part, and me for the emotional part,"<br>
<br>
Itsuki said. "The dream team!"<br>
<br>
"I'm a little apprehensive about your advice…"<br>
<br>
"How rude!"<br>
<br>
"Just kidding… I trust you, somewhat."<br>
<br>
"This guy just can't be honest with his feelings."<br>
<br>
Itsuki ribbed Amane with his elbow. Amane deliberately ignored his very existence<br>
<br>
and shifted his gaze back to Yuuta, who was smiling beside him.<br>
<br>
Amane had already tried on and chosen some shoes, as well as the other things he<br>
<br>
needed. Figuring they would be in the way if they lingered too long in the store, he<br>
<br>
held up the merchandise in his hands to suggest that they hurry to the cashier.<br>
<br>
"Kadowaki, should we go pay?"<br>
<br>
"I guess you could. I thought I might get some new running wear, too."<br>
<br>
"Isn't it a little cruel to ignore me, guys?"<br>
<br>
Itsuki knew what they were up to, and shouted after them in a slightly disheartened<br>
<br>
voice as they headed for the registers. Amane and Yuuta looked at each other and<br>
<br>
laughed a little.<br>
<br>
"…So what that means is, I'm going to do a little more exercise, so that will probably<br>
<br>
increase the amount of time I'm out of the house."<br>
<br>
After getting home and devouring the entire dinner that Mahiru had made, Amane<br>
<br>
told her that he was going to be around the house less often.<br>
<br>
Although his training would be something he did by himself, he figured that it would<br>
<br>
inconvenience her if he didn't say anything, since they spent a lot of time together and<br>
<br>
since she was in charge of fixing dinner.<br>
<br>
Mahiru, who was relaxing comfortably on the sofa after dinner as usual, widened her<br>
<br>
caramel-coloured eyes in slight surprise at Amane's words.<br>
<br>
"I'll adjust the menu to account for exercise, but… this is quite sudden. Exercising is<br>
<br>
good, but what prompted this?"<br>
<br>
"…I guess I just wanted to improve myself a little more, as a guy," Amane deflected.<br>
<br>
Naturally, there was no way he could tell her openly that it was because he wanted her<br>
<br>
approval, or that he wanted to look as good as she did, or that he wanted her to find<br>
<br>
him attractive.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's laughing rang like a clear and beautiful bell. "My goodness, that's a line I<br>
<br>
never thought I'd hear from the Amane who was living a slovenly life until half a year<br>
<br>
ago."<br>
<br>
"Come on, don't make fun of me… There's no harm in focusing more on my studies, my<br>
<br>
fitness, or my appearance."<br>
<br>
"Well, that's true, but…"<br>
<br>
Amane let his eyes wander. Mahiru's gaze implied that she was surprised to hear<br>
<br>
something like this coming from him, but she didn't seem like she was going to<br>
<br>
question him any further.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had an exasperated but somewhat charming smile, and she poked Amane's<br>
<br>
cheek with her fingertip teasingly.<br>
<br>
"…Just don't overdo it, all right? You're an overachiever, Amane. I know that once you<br>
<br>
decide to do something, you follow through, so please ask someone for help if it looks<br>
<br>
like you might get carried away."<br>
<br>
"I'm not worried about that. I've got a trainer."<br>
<br>
"Kadowaki?"<br>
<br>
"He's not an actual instructor, but he can teach me all sorts of basic things."<br>
<br>
"I guess that makes me your personal chef. I'll think carefully about nutritional<br>
<br>
balance when I make your meals."<br>
<br>
If Amane was going to start exercising and getting in shape, then naturally he would<br>
<br>
need to change his diet, too. Since he was already skinny, he knew he needed to put on<br>
<br>
some weight, which meant eating more in general. That in turn meant more work for<br>
<br>
Mahiru.<br>
<br>
Amane knew he depended on Mahiru for most of his meals, so he felt bad about asking<br>
<br>
even more from her, but she accepted the challenge without so much as a sour look.<br>
<br>
"Sorry for causing you all sorts of trouble."<br>
<br>
"No, if you've made up your mind, I'll be glad to help and cheer you on, but… you<br>
<br>
mustn't forget that first we have exams to get through, all right?"<br>
<br>
"I haven't forgotten. I've been reviewing every day."<br>
<br>
"That's great."<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't summon the willpower to shake her off as she patted his head and 1<br>
<br>
praised him in a soft voice that oozed sweetness.<br>
<br>
But he also had mixed feelings about not putting up any resistance, so he shot her a<br>
<br>
slightly reproachful look.<br>
<br>
"…Don't make fun of me. I'm perfectly capable of balancing my studies with my<br>
<br>
training."<br>
<br>
Amane was earnest by nature and took his classes seriously. He was the type who<br>
<br>
could mostly grasp the material just by sitting through the lesson. Since he also never<br>
<br>
failed to review and prepare at home, he basically had no worries when it came to<br>
<br>
academics.<br>
<br>
He wouldn't be neglecting his studies just by diverting a little of that energy to<br>
<br>
exercise. In fact, he intended to get more serious about his studies as well. He was<br>
<br>
determined not to fall behind in either department, lest he fail to keep up with Mahiru.<br>
<br>
"You'll tire yourself out doing that. Shall I pamper you once for good luck?"<br>
<br>
"Look here—"<br>
<br>
"Well, should you ever request it, I'll pamper you any time, so—" Mahiru patted her<br>
<br>
chest reassuringly and smiled.<br>
<br>
The memory of burying his face in the soft flesh there the other day made Amane press<br>
<br>
his lips together.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had only embraced him in an attempt to console him when he seemed down,<br>
<br>
but it was the sort of gesture that had particular significance to a boy of his age. At the<br>
<br>
time, he had been so caught up in his emotions that he had been more preoccupied<br>
<br>
with the kindness she had shown him than the physical sensations of the embrace.<br>
<br>
Next time, Amane knew he would take in and savor the feeling of her body. Precisely<br>
<br>
because he was aware of how shameless that would be, he wanted to refrain.<br>
<br>
"…It's frightening how you seem willing to do anything I ask," he muttered.<br>
<br>
"I mean, if it's something I'm able to do, I'll do what I can. Of course, I expect to be<br>
<br>
repaid, though."<br>
<br>
"I think I would feel even worse if you did all sorts of things for me without any<br>
<br>
expectation of repayment."<br>
<br>
"But when it comes to acts of selfless love and altruism, in most cases, a sense of<br>
<br>
emotional satisfaction is pretty much the only compensation, right?"<br>
<br>
"Incidentally, how do you want me to thank you?"<br>
<br>
"…I'd like you to listen to a request of mine."<br>
<br>
This was Mahiru, so Amane wasn't expecting her to ask for money or anything, but he<br>
<br>
snickered unintentionally at the sweet way she asked for such vague restitution.<br>
<br>
"Sure, as long as it's something I'm able to do. Any kind of fair exchange."<br>
<br>
"My request is pretty selfish."<br>
<br>
"Somehow I doubt that."<br>
<br>
"It really is… You can only say that because you don't know the true extent of my<br>
<br>
selfishness."<br>
<br>
"All right, let's hear it, then. What's your request?" Amane figured that if she was<br>
<br>
making such a big deal about it, it must be something major. He was curious to know<br>
<br>
what a big request from Mahiru might be.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's face stiffened slightly.<br>
<br>
When Amane stared directly into her pretty caramel-coloured eyes, wondering what on<br>
<br>
earth she was about to say, she started to let her gaze wander.<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't make out whether Mahiru's wish was truly something so significant<br>
<br>
that she was hesitant to say it out loud, or if she was just putting on an act.<br>
<br>
He stared intently at her as her cheeks gradually reddened.<br>
<br>
"Well…"<br>
<br>
"Yes?"<br>
<br>
"Umm, it's…"<br>
<br>
"It's…?"<br>
<br>
"…A-Amane, I want you to pat my head, too." 1<br>
<br>
Without meaning to, Amane smiled stiffly at Mahiru, who had started to say something<br>
<br>
else, and helplessly made that desperate plea in her panic to avoid voicing her original<br>
<br>
request.<br>
<br>
"Is that what you're going with? There was something else you were about to say,<br>
<br>
wasn't there?"<br>
<br>
"It's fine."<br>
<br>
He was curious to know what she had been about to say, but thought it would put her<br>
<br>
in a bad mood if he pressed anymore, so he left it there and extended a hand.<br>
<br>
He did pat her head occasionally, but it was rare for Mahiru herself to ask for it. He<br>
<br>
would do this sort of thing anytime she asked without expecting anything in return,<br>
<br>
and in fact, he very much enjoyed it, so long as Mahiru didn't hate it. But he did find it<br>
<br>
adorable that she had humbly asked for it out loud.<br>
<br>
The tension visibly left Mahiru's face as Amane stroked her head just as she had<br>
<br>
requested.<br>
<br>
"I don't know what part of this is supposed to be selfish, though."<br>
<br>
"It is selfish. Because I want you to touch me more."<br>
<br>
"Touch you?"<br>
<br>
Amane's movements stiffened. Before he noticed her moving, Mahiru was looking up<br>
<br>
at him with her usual soft face and glistening eyes.<br>
<br>
"I like it when you touch me, Amane. I don't usually enjoy making physical contact with 2<br>
<br>
people, but I think your hands feel nice."<br>
<br>
"Is that… so?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru seemed oblivious to the implications of what she'd just said. She was wearing<br>
<br>
her usual gentle expression as she nudged closer to him, pleadingly.<br>
<br>
As the distance between them narrowed, Amane could smell her sweet scent more<br>
<br>
clearly, and his heartbeat inevitably quickened.<br>
<br>
…I think this girl might be trying to kill me.<br>
<br>
Any normal guy would count himself lucky to hear the girl he liked say that she wanted<br>
<br>
him to touch her; he'd probably go ahead and do it, knowing what he was getting into.<br>
<br>
Amane was a healthy young man, and the invitation was very tempting, but he also<br>
<br>
knew that Mahiru was so affectionate with him because of how deeply she trusted<br>
<br>
him.<br>
<br>
"You don't touch me often, Amane, but when you do, you do it in a way that's gentle<br>
<br>
and thoughtful, don't you? It's really calming, and it feels nice. I think you emit a<br>
<br>
soothing aura or something."<br>
<br>
Mahiru was probably teasing Amane, at least a little.<br>
<br>
"…It's not all that relaxing for me, you know. You're a girl, Mahiru, so it's not like I can<br>
<br>
touch you thoughtlessly."<br>
<br>
"I don't mind."<br>
<br>
"I do. Let me try telling you to touch me; I bet you'll feel uncomfortable."<br>
<br>
He cautioned against it a little too strongly—deep down, he was still feeling insecure<br>
<br>
about the fact that she didn't seem to think of him as a real man.<br>
<br>
In response, he got a placid smile and the question, "…Will you touch me?"<br>
<br>
It felt like she was carelessly trying to provoke him. Against his better judgment, he<br>
<br>
pinched Mahiru's squishy cheeks. In a sense, he did touch her as asked, but the<br>
<br>
dissatisfaction on Mahiru's face was evident.<br>
<br>
"Come on, I won't mention it outside this apartment, and I won't ask the same of<br>
<br>
anyone but you, Amane…" 1<br>
<br>
"Absolutely not, don't be ridiculous."<br>
<br>
Amane didn't mean it that way, but his answer came out almost in a growl, filled with<br>
<br>
emotion. He was flustered, hearing words that she would only say to him.<br>
<br>
Amane was frantically trying to get ahold of himself and all the unspeakable thoughts<br>
<br>
that were filling his mind. He cupped Mahiru's hands in his. That was as much<br>
<br>
touching as he could allow himself.<br>
<br>
Mahiru blinked, fluttering her long eyelashes, and gave Amane a gentle smile that<br>
<br>
looked just a little embarrassed. He could clearly see relief and happiness in her<br>
<br>
expression, which made him feel embarrassed, too.<br>
<br>
"…You feel warm. Speaking of, sometimes you get really warm."<br>
<br>
"…I'll let go this instant."<br>
<br>
"No, don't. As I expected, your hands are warm, and big, and rugged… very different<br>
<br>
from mine."<br>
<br>
"You're small, and dainty, and delicate, so I feel anxious touching you."<br>
<br>
"I won't break that easily. Besides, when you touch me, you're always gentle. I can tell<br>
<br>
right away that you would absolutely never hurt me."<br>
<br>
"…I'd never be rough with any girl."<br>
<br>
Amane was absolutely sure that he would never knowingly hurt the girl he wanted to<br>
<br>
cherish forever. To him, she was someone very delicate who he wanted to protect from<br>
<br>
harm.<br>
<br>
Even though he knew she wasn't fragile, he carefully stroked the back of Mahiru's hand<br>
<br>
as if he was touching a fragile piece of porcelain, and she narrowed her
<p></p>
caramel-coloured eyes as if it tickled.<br>
<br>
"…That's exactly why I trust you and why I'm asking you to touch me." Mahiru smiled.<br>
<br>
She was overwhelmingly lovely, and, suppressing the urge to embrace her right then<br>
<br>
and there and make her his, Amane mirrored her smile.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 42: The Angel in the Dream, Feelings of Shame<br>
<br>
"…I love you."<br>
<br>
A voice full of anticipation spoke these few, simple words.<br>
<br>
Her voice was quiet as it left her soft, pink lips, and she approached him seductively.<br>
<br>
Amane was propping himself up on the bed, and she lowered her hips onto his legs, 1<br>
<br>
pinning him in place.<br>
<br>
Strangely, he didn't feel any weight at all.<br>
<br>
But the soft touch of her skin and her fragrant smell filled his senses.<br>
<br>
Mahiru leaned coquettishly up against him and wrapped her arms around his back,<br>
<br>
closing the gap between them as she cast her eyes down shyly. Amane looked down<br>
<br>
and saw a fresh expanse of skin that normally never saw the light of day, peeking from<br>
<br>
the neckline of her white dress.<br>
<br>
He tried to avert his gaze from the deep valley between her breasts, but Mahiru moved<br>
<br>
her hands from his back up to his neck and pulled his face closer, as if to tell him not<br>
<br>
to look away.<br>
<br>
A sigh escaped her lips.<br>
<br>
"…Touch me more?" she whispered.<br>
<br>
Amane wrapped his arms around her delicate back and slowly brought his lips<br>
<br>
closer—<br>
<br>
"—Ah?"<br>
<br>
He sat up straight.<br>
<br>
Amane was alone in his bedroom. The morning sun shone into the room through a gap<br>
<br>
in the closed curtains.<br>
<br>
When he looked at the clock on his side table, he saw that it was just past five.<br>
<br>
With the approach of summer, the sun was rising earlier—it was early enough to get<br>
<br>
a start on the day, although Amane certainly hadn't intended to wake up at this hour.<br>
<br>
He pressed the palm of his hand against his face as he remembered what he'd been<br>
<br>
dreaming about and was immediately overcome with shame.<br>
<br>
This is the worst…<br>
<br>
The dream had taken him by surprise.<br>
<br>
Previously, when Mahiru had appeared in his dreams, she had behaved as usual—<br>
<br>
never acting with such blatant desire. When she'd told him the day before that she<br>
<br>
wanted him to touch her more, that must have provided the inspiration for his fantasy,<br>
<br>
but even so, he felt ashamed. His mind had imagined Mahiru acting in ways she never<br>
<br>
would. Even though it had only been a dream, he still felt guilty about having those<br>
<br>
kinds of feelings toward her.<br>
<br>
It was very frustrating—he wanted to cherish Mahiru and treat her respectfully, but<br>
<br>
his subconscious mind apparently had other ideas. He had the fleeting temptation to<br>
<br>
slam his head into the wall.<br>
<br>
Amane decided that some exercise would be just the thing to clear his head. Pushing<br>
<br>
away his subconscious desires, he made to leave his room, but paused on the way out.<br>
<br>
"…Kill me now."<br>
<br>
Before he could start the day, he was going to need a nice long shower to wash away<br>
<br>
any lingering frustrations.<br>
<br>
"Hey, Amane, what's with the dead expression?"<br>
<br>
After getting up, Amane had gone for an early morning run to shake off his shame,<br>
<br>
exhausting himself both physically and mentally. Chitose must have noticed, and<br>
<br>
approached him during a break at school.<br>
<br>
Amane looked at Itsuki, who was sitting beside him, to ask whether he looked that<br>
<br>
lifeless, and Itsuki nodded.<br>
<br>
"Ah, well… I went for a little run this morning," Amane explained.<br>
<br>
"That'll wipe you out, no doubt." Chitose nodded. "A couch potato is sure to get groggy<br>
<br>
when they finally start working out." Chitose cackled and grinned lightheartedly as<br>
<br>
she slapped him on the back.<br>
<br>
Amane was relieved that she didn't press him any further.<br>
<br>
Telling Chitose something meant that Mahiru would know eventually anyway, so<br>
<br>
Amane did his best to avoid telling her anything important. Honestly, he didn't want<br>
<br>
to let anyone know about his dream.<br>
<br>
"If you're not feeling well, you ought to go right home after school's over and rest. It's<br>
<br>
best not to overdo it," Mahiru added, standing beside Chitose like her chaperone.<br>
<br>
They were at school, so Mahiru was in her "angel mode," but her concern was genuine.<br>
<br>
Amane had a feeling she was going to spoil him when they got home.<br>
<br>
However, Amane knew that he wouldn't be able to accept her kindness—his lingering<br>
<br>
guilt over the dream wouldn't even allow him to look Mahiru in the eye.<br>
<br>
Without meeting her gaze, Amane responded flatly, "Thank you for your concern. I'm<br>
<br>
fine, so there's no need to worry." He did his best not to allow any emotion to creep<br>
<br>
into his words. From the corner of his eye, he could see Mahiru's expression stiffen<br>
<br>
slightly.<br>
<br>
Amane was trying not to let the awkwardness he felt every time he looked at Mahiru<br>
<br>
show on his face, but from her perspective, it probably seemed like he had suddenly<br>
<br>
gotten angry at her.<br>
<br>
He couldn't possibly explain the reason for his icy demeanor, so there was nothing to<br>
<br>
do but keep his mouth shut and evade the issue.<br>
<br>
Everyone knew that Amane was a gloomy introvert, downright unsociable really, so<br>
<br>
nothing about this behavior should have aroused anyone's suspicions.<br>
<br>
"…Are you feeling unwell, Amane?" Mahiru asked. 2<br>
<br>
"No, I'm not sick, I'm just tired," he replied. "Really, I'm trying my best to not fall asleep.<br>
<br>
We've got tests coming up, so I can't very well sleep through class now."<br>
<br>
"Geez! So serious." Chitose giggled.<br>
<br>
"You should try to be more serious, too," he chided. "Our school's exams are hard, so<br>
<br>
stop playing around and try studying for a change."<br>
<br>
"Speaking of exams, I think it would be more fun, and more effective, if we did our<br>
<br>
studying all together, don't you?" Chitose asked.<br>
<br>
"Oh? Then perhaps Shiina ought to tutor you."<br>
<br>
"I guess that would work, but…"<br>
<br>
Chitose was staring hard at Amane, but he refused to make eye contact with her. He<br>
<br>
pulled the materials for the next class out of his desk and directed his attention toward<br>
<br>
arranging them.<br>
<br>
If he participated any longer in the conversation, he would inevitably have to talk to<br>
<br>
Mahiru. He sighed softly and leafed through a textbook as if the rest of the discussion<br>
<br>
was no concern of his.<br>
<br>
Amane left school promptly after classes ended, did the evening's shopping, and<br>
<br>
returned home.<br>
<br>
As usual, Mahiru was already in his apartment, preparing food, but she was obviously<br>
<br>
feeling dejected.<br>
<br>
She seemed to be able to sense that something was different about his mood and kept<br>
<br>
glancing over at him and frowning. Often at home, they would act a little more familiar,<br>
<br>
but that evening, she carefully maintained a sense of distance that was not all that<br>
<br>
different from how she behaved at school.<br>
<br>
Amane still felt terribly awkward, and he tried to push thoughts of Mahiru out of his<br>
<br>
mind as best he could. It was easy to understand how she might interpret that as him<br>
<br>
ignoring her.<br>
<br>
"Are you mad at me…?" Mahiru asked nervously, after they had finished eating dinner<br>
<br>
without even looking at each other once.<br>
<br>
Realizing his error, Amane looked up at her.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's eyes flickered with anxiety.<br>
<br>
"I'm not mad," he replied.<br>
<br>
"People only answer that way when they're mad. You've been acting strange all day,<br>
<br>
and you're being terse with me… Did I do something to upset you without realizing<br>
<br>
it…?"<br>
<br>
Even though Amane had clearly been the one avoiding her, Mahiru sounded apologetic,<br>
<br>
which made him realize that he had only been thinking about his own personal<br>
<br>
discomfort.<br>
<br>
Flustered, Amane took Mahiru's hands in his and peered into her eyes, which were<br>
<br>
more tearful than usual.<br>
<br>
"N-no, that's not it. You didn't do anything, Mahiru. I'm sorry for hurting your feelings."<br>
<br>
"So then, why… why are you acting so cold?"<br>
<br>
"W-well, um, there are a number of reasons, I guess you could say…"<br>
<br>
Amane found himself faltering when it came time to offer any.<br>
<br>
He obviously knew he couldn't be too honest—a girl like Mahiru would definitely be<br>
<br>
put off by something like that. He didn't want to put her in an awkward position or<br>
<br>
make her uncomfortable around him later.<br>
<br>
"I've been wondering if maybe you'd gotten tired of me or something…"<br>
<br>
"Absolutely not!" Amane insisted. "I-I've just got some personal stuff going on…<br>
<br>
There's just a lot on my mind."<br>
<br>
"…And you're not going to tell me about it?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru frowned dejectedly and looked at the floor. Amane could only groan.<br>
<br>
How can I possibly explain?<br>
<br>
He hated lying to her, so he decided the best course of action was to only tell her the<br>
<br>
mildest version of the truth. Though he wasn't sure exactly how to round off the rough<br>
<br>
edges or sound vague in this particular case.<br>
<br>
If he messed up, she wouldn't understand, and she might even be repulsed instead.<br>
<br>
"It—it's no big deal, really, okay?"<br>
<br>
"…Even though it's something bad enough to make you ignore me?"<br>
<br>
"No, the thing is, I mean, how do I put this? I'm doing it to exercise self-control, or, like,<br>
<br>
to settle my mind down."<br>
<br>
"You don't feel calm when I'm around?"<br>
<br>
"That's not what I mean, it's just, it's d-difficult."<br>
<br>
"So it's hard to spend time with me?"<br>
<br>
"That's not what I said! Geez, how can I say this…?"<br>
<br>
If she was a boy, it would have been easy. Amane wasn't sure he could put it in a way 2<br>
<br>
that a girl would understand, no matter what he said to her. Yet he had to tell her<br>
<br>
something, or she would misunderstand again.<br>
<br>
Mahiru obviously wanted to know why he was avoiding her if she hadn't done<br>
<br>
anything wrong, but all Amane could manage to tell her was that it was hard to explain.<br>
<br>
For the sake of his likely nonexistent pride, he needed to put it as delicately as possible.<br>
<br>
"…So you said that you want me to touch you more," he explained tentatively. "And<br>
<br>
because of that, how do I say this, I… had a, uh, a dream."<br>
<br>
"A… dream?"<br>
<br>
"…A dream where you were pleading with me, very sweetly, for certain things…"<br>
<br>
Somehow, that was the best answer Amane could come up with.<br>
<br>
Mahiru made a face like she didn't understand what he was talking about. She blinked<br>
<br>
her wide eyes dramatically.<br>
<br>
"R-really, I hate that I dreamed something like that," Amane continued. "I try to avoid<br>
<br>
seeing you that way, and I would never be pushy about touching you. But this time I<br>
<br>
just… it's because yesterday, you… you were saying such cute things. And then, about<br>
<br>
me avoiding you awkwardly… it wasn't because I was mad at you or anything, it was<br>
<br>
because I was disgusted with myself…"<br>
<br>
"…How exactly was I pleading with you, Amane?"<br>
<br>
"Are you trying to embarrass me?!" he balked. Mahiru hadn't recoiled from him, which<br>
<br>
was good, but her curiosity seemed somehow even more dangerous, and he could feel<br>
<br>
his face twitching.<br>
<br>
Dreams supposedly reflected desires, so if he told her what he had dreamed, she<br>
<br>
would then know he thought of her and looked at her in that way, even if it was not on<br>
<br>
purpose.<br>
<br>
"Embarrass you…? No, I was just thinking I must have been really aggressive, if it was<br>
<br>
enough to make you feel uncomfortable. So I wanted to know, for reference."<br>
<br>
"You don't need to know. What sort of reference would that be useful for anyway?"<br>
<br>
"…Like for when I'm trying to make your heart race."<br>
<br>
"Would you please stop trying to give me a heart attack?"<br>
<br>
Amane didn't understand why Mahiru seemed to enjoy tormenting him. She had<br>
<br>
already found plenty of questionable ways to surprise him, so he didn't want to give<br>
<br>
her any more ideas.<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked relieved, like she'd completely forgotten about any concern or anxiety<br>
<br>
that had been previously troubling her. Her cheeks had reddened faintly, probably<br>
<br>
because Amane had let the word "cute" slip out of his mouth.<br>
<br>
"It's a relief to hear that I'm not being shunned—I'm glad we cleared that up."<br>
<br>
For some reason, Mahiru's mouth curled upward in a good-humored smile. She stared<br>
<br>
contently at Amane, who had his own lips tightly drawn in shame and embarrassment.<br>
<br>
"Amane, you're kind of… well, among the boys I know, you're the most innocent."<br>
<br>
"Oh, be quiet, I could say the same about you."<br>
<br>
"I'm sure you would have been more surprised if you'd learned that I was used to being<br>
<br>
in the company of males quite often… Really, though, I've never spent much time<br>
<br>
around boys before. You're the only one I'm this close with, Amane."<br>
<br>
"…A-and I hardly ever associate with girls, so…"<br>
<br>
Amane was aware that he sounded pathetic, but he couldn't bring himself to lie.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if he had tried to pass himself off as someone who spent a lot of time with<br>
<br>
girls, Mahiru probably would have laughed at him.<br>
<br>
"Well, you seem pretty good at handling girls, all things considered," she remarked.<br>
<br>
"You must be joking," Amane scoffed. "I can't handle anything. I'm just… I always try to<br>
<br>
do what's right, and be decent, like my parents always said. And if I do anything bad, I<br>
<br>
try to balance it out by doing something to make you happy, that's all. I'm happy when<br>
<br>
you're happy… surely there's nothing wrong with that?"<br>
<br>
"Nothing at all." Mahiru nodded. "You're sly that way, Amane."<br>
<br>
"What's that supposed to mean?"<br>
<br>
"Everything about you is sly."<br>
<br>
"Are you trying to put me down…?"<br>
<br>
"No, it's the opposite. I'm trying my best to encourage you, to get you to have more<br>
<br>
self-confidence."<br>
<br>
"…I don't understand what you're getting at, though."<br>
<br>
"That's fine, you don't have to understand right now." 1<br>
<br>
This wasn't the first time they'd had this exchange, and Amane still didn't know what<br>
<br>
about him was supposed to be devious.<br>
<br>
But Amane didn't think he needed to try too hard to find the answer.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had been so concerned and dejected by Amane's behavior. Now, though, she<br>
<br>
was smiling cheerfully without the least bit of worry.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, I got to hear something good today," she said.<br>
<br>
"Something good?"<br>
<br>
"You said that I'm the first person of the opposite sex you've ever been this close with."<br>
<br>
Amane responded to Mahiru's outrageous statement with a sudden coughing fit.<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked up at him curiously. It didn't seem like she had intended to provoke a<br>
<br>
reaction from him. She had probably just said what was on her mind. That was what<br>
<br>
made it so shocking for Amane.<br>
<br>
"Th-that's misleading… Well, it's not misleading, but you make it sound weird! And it's<br>
<br>
none of your business anyway!" he stammered.<br>
<br>
"Why are you getting so flustered? It's kind of nice, isn't it? Since I'm having all these<br>
<br>
firsts, too. It means that we've both fumbled our way closer together, right?"<br>
<br>
"…Well, that's true, but…"<br>
<br>
Thinking about how things had been up to this point, her observation did seem<br>
<br>
reasonable, but it felt overwhelmingly embarrassing to hear her say it so purely,<br>
<br>
without any other intentions. The more he tried not to overthink it, the more it<br>
<br>
weighed on him.<br>
<br>
"…Amane?"<br>
<br>
"It's nothing, so don't look at me, please."<br>
<br>
He didn't want her to see the shame that was practically oozing off of him again, and<br>
<br>
he turned his back to her without rising from the sofa.<br>
<br>
He didn't want to be seen, and he didn't want to look at her, either.<br>
<br>
"Why are you speaking so stiffly?"<br>
<br>
"Don't worry about it."<br>
<br>
"…All right, I won't look."<br>
<br>
Instead, Mahiru turned and sat with her back to his, so that she was able to lean<br>
<br>
against him. He turned his head to look at her and got a jab in the ribs.<br>
<br>
He couldn't see her face, but he was certain she was grinning mischievously.<br>
<br>
"If we sit like this, I'm 'not looking,' right?"<br>
<br>
"…I guess not."<br>
<br>
"Well, you'll just have to deal with it, since I had to deal with you avoiding me all day."<br>
<br>
When she put it that way, Amane could tell that there was no way he was going to pull<br>
<br>
himself out of the hole he'd dug, and he wasn't even going to bother trying.<br>
<br>
Feeling a strange sort of tranquility, though the warmth gradually spreading through<br>
<br>
his back was making his chest throb, Amane let his chin rest on his knees.<br>
<br>
"…Please don't tell people about your first time or whatever anymore," he mumbled. "I<br>
<br>
really don't know how to endure it."<br>
<br>
He felt Mahiru shiver, as if she had only just then remembered the issue. Then,<br>
<br>
apparently, she turned around, because he felt her grab the back of his shirt.<br>
<br>
"Th-that's not what I meant to say at all, okay?! Well, it is, but I didn't say it with that<br>
<br>
in mind!"<br>
<br>
"I—I understand, so just don't say any more."<br>
<br>
Knowing that Mahiru had never been so close to anyone made it even more<br>
<br>
embarrassing when she talked about things like that.<br>
<br>
It didn't take much thought to realize that the two of them had experienced a lot of<br>
<br>
firsts together.<br>
<br>
At least in Amane's case, Mahiru was the first girl he had held hands with, except for<br>
<br>
his mother when he was a young child. Mahiru was also the only one he had ever<br>
<br>
embraced. It was very likely the same for her.<br>
<br>
To get to be part of these new experiences with the girl he liked, to be the first step for<br>
<br>
her, was delightful, embarrassing, and an honor.<br>
<br>
Amane found himself wishing that he could be her first and last love as well.<br>
<br>
He smiled quietly to himself as Mahiru put her forehead against his back and rubbed<br>
<br>
against him out of embarrassment. How nice it would be to stay by her side in the<br>
<br>
future, he thought.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 43: Studying with the Angel<br>
<br>
Things between Amane and Mahiru seemed to be back to normal the following day,<br>
<br>
and Chitose and Itsuki appeared relieved—apparently, they had been quite concerned.<br>
<br>
Amane's behavior had only changed slightly, but it must have been enough for them<br>
<br>
to notice.<br>
<br>
The events of the previous day weighed heavily on Amane's mind, but he wasn't acting<br>
<br>
as awkwardly with Mahiru anymore. There were still some things that were bothering<br>
<br>
him, but as long as they were in school, he couldn't say a word about them.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was giving everyone her usual angelic smile. She was currently surrounded by<br>
<br>
female classmates pestering her to teach them how to study.<br>
<br>
Midterms were starting next week, and the girls must have wanted Mahiru, the top<br>
<br>
genius in the grade, to be their tutor. There was a touch of bewilderment mixed into<br>
<br>
Mahiru's gentle smile.<br>
<br>
"I don't mind helping you all prepare for the tests, but I might not have enough room<br>
<br>
to host everyone…"<br>
<br>
Thinking this wasn't going to be good, Amane pricked up his ears to listen in. It seemed<br>
<br>
that the girls who wanted to study with Mahiru hoped they could do it at her place.<br>
<br>
They were probably curious to see what her apartment was like.<br>
<br>
That would be a problem, since Mahiru is such a private person.<br>
<br>
Although they weren't strangers, they weren't exactly friends, either, not like Chitose<br>
<br>
was. It would be very difficult for Mahiru to let them into her home.<br>
<br>
From Amane's perspective, too, he didn't want them coming around where he lived if<br>
<br>
it could be avoided, just in case they caught wind of anything. He could just imagine<br>
<br>
the girls prying into every detail, while he endured resentment from the boys.<br>
<br>
"Ah, no fair, no fair! I want help, too!"<br>
<br>
"Me toooo!"<br>
<br>
Then, other girls who had overheard the conversation put their hands up as well, and<br>
<br>
Mahiru was understandably wearing a troubled expression. Clearly there was no way<br>
<br>
so many people could fit in her apartment.<br>
<br>
To make matters worse, the boys were looking over enviously.<br>
<br>
"…Um, we could study together for an hour or two in the classroom after school today,"<br>
<br>
Mahiru suggested, as a compromise. Their classroom had plenty of space. Despite that,<br>
<br>
there didn't seem to be an end to the chorus of voices asking to join. Club activities<br>
<br>
were paused during exams, so it was probably much easier for people to gather than<br>
<br>
usual.<br>
<br>
As he listened to the loud shouts of his classmates from across the room, Amane<br>
<br>
couldn't help but feel bad for Mahiru.<br>
<br>
With a strangely cheerful grin, Itsuki prodded Amane. "You're not going to take part?"<br>
<br>
"Would there be any point?" he replied. "I already know everything that's going to be<br>
<br>
on the tests, and even if I didn't, with so many people, there won't be much time for<br>
<br>
everyone's questions anyway. Trust me, I'm better off studying on my own."<br>
<br>
"Well, I certainly must commend your discipline, Amane, but I think we'd better join<br>
<br>
this study session anyway. It's a matter of motivation."<br>
<br>
"I've always liked studying, so my motivation has always been—"<br>
<br>
"Not yours, hers."<br>
<br>
Amane looked over at Mahiru, making plans for a study session with more than half<br>
<br>
the class. It was obvious that she was going to have a hard time with so many people.<br>
<br>
She would probably feel better with a friend in the room. Finally, it began to dawn on<br>
<br>
Amane that he ought to attend, whether or not he felt the need to.<br>
<br>
"…Even though there's not really anything for her to teach me?" he asked.<br>
<br>
"It'll be fine," Itsuki insisted. "Look, you can tutor me. See, Chitose is going to join in,<br>
<br>
so I was gonna be stuck waiting for her anyway. There's no harm in studying a little<br>
<br>
while I'm there, eh?"<br>
<br>
"Teaching other people is not my strong point…"<br>
<br>
"Well, sure, the way you talk is can be a bit unfriendly, and you're not exactly the type<br>
<br>
to patiently explain things… but you wouldn't just let me fail, right?"<br>
<br>
Amane faltered in the face of Itsuki's confident voice and gaze.<br>
<br>
"I'm countin' on you, pal!" Itsuki cackled and clapped Amane on the shoulder.<br>
<br>
Amane gave up on turning him down and just nodded.<br>
<br>
Usually, after class ended, a handful of students might hang around for a while. But<br>
<br>
that day, there was a bustle of activity that was truly rare to see.<br>
<br>
The desks, which had been neatly arranged during cleaning time, were now pushed<br>
<br>
together to form several clusters, and students assembled themselves with their<br>
<br>
groups of friends. Even the boys from class joined, which meant there were six times<br>
<br>
as many people as there should have been.<br>
<br>
Amane sat facing Itsuki in the seat farthest away from Mahiru.<br>
<br>
"…I can't be very much help like this, can I?" he whispered.<br>
<br>
"I'm ready to learn, teacher!" Itsuki replied.<br>
<br>
"…Wouldn't we be better off at home?"<br>
<br>
"I'm just here to study while I wait for Chi. Besides, she's going to be late getting home,<br>
<br>
and you wouldn't want to leave her on her own, right?"<br>
<br>
Amane narrowed his eyes at Itsuki, who was giving him a pointed look, but Itsuki just<br>
<br>
laughed.<br>
<br>
Mahiru usually tried to get home before dark if she could, but because of the study<br>
<br>
session, she was sure to be late. Mahiru was a very cautious person and even carried<br>
<br>
a personal safety alarm around with her, but Itsuki was right, it probably wouldn't be<br>
<br>
good to let her go back alone in the dark.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, Amane couldn't possibly walk her home with all their classmates<br>
<br>
watching, so he would have to keep his distance and stealthily watch over her as they<br>
<br>
walked.<br>
<br>
"You don't seem to see this for the opportunity it is, Amane…"<br>
<br>
"What, you want me to turn into some sort of predator now? That's not me, and<br>
<br>
personally, I have a problem with the idea of taking advantage of someone's<br>
<br>
carelessness to make a move."<br>
<br>
"That attitude of yours must be how you've gained her trust. Well, you guys will be<br>
<br>
heading back to the same place, so I guess there's no point trying anything on the way<br>
<br>
anyhow. It's not like you won't have plenty of chances to make your move."<br>
<br>
"It's not like I would anyway! If I made her hate me, or made her cry, I'd die."<br>
<br>
Mahiru left him plenty of openings, since she let him inside her defenses. Even so,<br>
<br>
Amane had never considered seizing one of those chances to try anything. Rather, he<br>
<br>
had always warned her about letting her guard down.<br>
<br>
If he tried anything with Mahiru when she was being careless because of her trust in<br>
<br>
him, their happy relationship could very well disappear. Amane didn't want to lose her<br>
<br>
trust, or his dignity.<br>
<br>
Itsuki knew what his friend was like. He shrugged in a slightly exasperated manner,<br>
<br>
but Amane paid him no attention and opened his textbook to the material that would<br>
<br>
be covered on the exams.<br>
<br>
"Look, I'm all good here, so why don't you tell me where we should start? I don't have<br>
<br>
trouble with anything, which means it's up to you to point out the sections you don't<br>
<br>
understand if you want to get anything done." Amane drummed his fingers on the<br>
<br>
pages and pressed his friend for an answer.<br>
<br>
"Dodging the issue, huh?" Itsuki grinned and opened his own book.<br>
<br>
Itsuki wasn't stupid or anything—in fact, he was quite capable. He had a good<br>
<br>
understanding of his own abilities and was the type who could produce good results<br>
<br>
with minimal effort. He just found studying a bore and goofed off a lot to annoy his<br>
<br>
parents. Fundamentally, he had an earnest disposition.<br>
<br>
Amane had heard that in middle school, Itsuki had been an honors student, but when<br>
<br>
he'd started hanging out with Chitose, it apparently caused some trouble at home and<br>
<br>
kicked off his rebellious phase.<br>
<br>
"I seriously do not understand English sentences," Itsuki complained.<br>
<br>
"Maybe you should start by memorizing the vocabulary… For now, you can begin with<br>
<br>
the words and sentences that are sure to show up on the test. You slept through the<br>
<br>
class when the teacher went over the exam material, but he did tell us what to expect."<br>
<br>
Itsuki rarely skipped class, but he often fell asleep. Amane poked him in the forehead<br>
<br>
and continued.<br>
<br>
"For the time being, I'll make another copy of my notes for you. There's a limit to how<br>
<br>
much you can cram for the long reading comprehension section. Basically, at this<br>
<br>
point, it's probably impossible to learn it all. Don't worry about doing it perfectly, but<br>
<br>
just try not to miss the vocabulary and multiple-choice questions. As long as you know<br>
<br>
at least a little bit, on most multiple-choice questions you can narrow it down to two<br>
<br>
answers, so we should work on getting you to where you can reliably pick the correct<br>
<br>
one out of the two. Let's place the most emphasis on scoring attainable points. You're<br>
<br>
just barely passing English, right?"<br>
<br>
"Whew, you're a lifesaver, man! I'll thank you later by giving you a push in the right<br>
<br>
direction."<br>
<br>
"I do not need you to do that. It's none of your concern."<br>
<br>
Amane wanted to progress slowly in his relationship with Mahiru, in his own way, so<br>
<br>
if Itsuki pushed him too hard, he was liable to resist out of spite.<br>
<br>
Itsuki met his friend's refusal with a frustrated look, but Amane wasn't inclined to<br>
<br>
change his opinion.<br>
<br>
Before he could worry about progressing in their relationship, Amane wanted to<br>
<br>
improve himself enough that he would feel confident about being with Mahiru. To do<br>
<br>
that, he needed to prioritize his studies.<br>
<br>
Itsuki seemed like he was about to say something else, but Amane ignored him, and<br>
<br>
once he had counted the number of pages in the notebook he was going to copy, he<br>
<br>
slammed it shut. "Good grief," Amane said as he picked up his mechanical pencil.<br>
<br>
Itsuki assumed a studying posture, and with quiet relief, Amane glanced over in<br>
<br>
Mahiru's direction.<br>
<br>
Just like always, she was smiling as she kindly explained the material to her<br>
<br>
classmates. As he watched her circulate busily through the room, smiling at everyone<br>
<br>
equally, Amane thought to himself that being the campus angel must be a tough role<br>
<br>
to play.<br>
<br>
"Why can't I get the answer here?"<br>
<br>
"Use the formula."<br>
<br>
"I'm using it, but I'm not getting the answer!"<br>
<br>
Chitose's group was studying together while chatting happily, and their cluster of<br>
<br>
desks was especially lively. However, a different group of boys seemed to be in trouble.<br>
<br>
Even Mahiru wasn't able to follow up with every single person, and depending on each<br>
<br>
individual's ability to comprehend the material, it could take time to teach them. On<br>
<br>
top of that, Mahiru kept getting called over by the rowdiest students, so even though<br>
<br>
she was trying to help those classmates who weren't incessantly demanding her<br>
<br>
attention, she couldn't avoid getting pulled this way and that.<br>
<br>
Amane hesitated for a moment over what to do, then stood up from his seat.<br>
<br>
He walked over to the classmates who were frowning in frustration and looked over<br>
<br>
their shoulders to check the part in the text and the equation that was tripping them<br>
<br>
up. Then he slowly pointed to the relevant section in the textbook.<br>
<br>
His classmates looked up at him, seemingly surprised by his sudden appearance, but<br>
<br>
Amane turned a blind eye to their stares and walked them through the problem.<br>
<br>
In this group's case, they were simply using the wrong formula to solve the question,<br>
<br>
so it was easy to sort things out once Amane pointed out the issue that was giving<br>
<br>
them trouble.<br>
<br>
Amane felt relieved that they had accepted his help despite his abrupt intrusion. He<br>
<br>
made eye contact with the boy sitting across from him, who was blinking repeatedly.<br>
<br>
"I'm not Shiina, but it looks like she has her hands full. Sorry for butting in."<br>
<br>
"…No, I'm grateful for the help," the boy said. "But I didn't expect you to come over and<br>
<br>
say something, Fujimiya."<br>
<br>
"Well, you looked like you were having trouble," Amane responded.<br>
<br>
He found it almost darkly comical just how cold and unfriendly everyone always<br>
<br>
assumed he was, but he knew it was true that he could be unsociable and downright<br>
<br>
gloomy, so he couldn't deny it.<br>
<br>
Amane was turning to leave with an awkward smile when the classmate across from<br>
<br>
him asked, "So what about this one?" and showed Amane another problem he couldn't<br>
<br>
work out.<br>
<br>
Since he was there already, Amane demonstrated how to solve that question, too.<br>
<br>
The other boys all looked at each other, then for some reason, over at Itsuki.<br>
<br>
"Hey, Itsuki! Can we borrow Fujimiya?"<br>
<br>
"Well, he's mine, but I guess there's no helping it." Itsuki grinned.<br>
<br>
"Since when did I become yours?"<br>
<br>
Amane feigned offense at Itsuki's comment. He noticed that his friend was cheerfully<br>
<br>
pushing their two desks over to the boys in the study group. Amane was shocked at<br>
<br>
how quickly Itsuki joined them.<br>
<br>
He didn't really mind, but he wished Itsuki had asked his permission first.<br>
<br>
Amane sighed and sat back down in his own seat, which had been integrated into the<br>
<br>
new group. As he did, he kicked Itsuki lightly below the desks.<br>
<br>
"Just so you know, I'm not that good at teaching," he stated.<br>
<br>
"Well, thanks even so," one of the boys said. "Miss Angel looks busy over there."<br>
<br>
"We all joined in at the last minute," another added, "so Shiina can't make it around to<br>
<br>
everyone on her own."<br>
<br>
They were staring longingly at the group that Mahiru was tutoring, but it wasn't<br>
<br>
exactly envy in their eyes. They simply looked disappointed.<br>
<br>
"We decided to come because it sounded fun, figuring we'd be lucky to receive any<br>
<br>
help, so getting help from Fujimiya is fine with us."<br>
<br>
"Well, ideally the angel, 'cause she's cute and I'd be happier, but…"<br>
<br>
"Well, don't expect me to be cute," Amane said, smiling wryly. "So show me the part<br>
<br>
you don't understand…?"<br>
<br>
Amane prided himself on not having an ounce of cuteness to him. As a fellow guy,<br>
<br>
though, he understood what the others were trying to say. Who wouldn't prefer to be<br>
<br>
tutored by a friendly and intelligent girl like Mahiru, rather than an unsociable guy<br>
<br>
like him? Anybody would have been happier with her.<br>
<br>
Amane shrugged, then asked them where they needed help and explained the material<br>
<br>
to them.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, Amane was able to explain all the problems, and since the other students<br>
<br>
had asked for his help, they tackled the material earnestly and came to understand it<br>
<br>
fairly quickly.<br>
<br>
Even Itsuki joined in with the other four students, asking questions and solving<br>
<br>
example problems. It was hard enough for Amane to handle four additional people, so<br>
<br>
things must have been even more difficult for Mahiru.<br>
<br>
With that thought, Amane looked over in her direction and saw her answering<br>
<br>
questions for the neighboring group.<br>
<br>
However, none of the questions were related to the exam material.<br>
<br>
"…Do I have a type?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru pondered the question curiously as the girls who had asked looked at her with<br>
<br>
keen interest.<br>
<br>
The girls seemed to have changed tactics on Mahiru, who had been stubbornly<br>
<br>
refusing to reveal anything about the boy she had mentioned. Now they were trying<br>
<br>
to gather information indirectly on what kind of person he might be. Mahiru had never<br>
<br>
stated outright whether the mystery boy was her boyfriend or someone she liked, but<br>
<br>
even so, as one might expect, they all seemed to assume that she was interested in<br>
<br>
him.<br>
<br>
The girls hadn't asked their question very loudly, but the surrounding groups still<br>
<br>
overheard it, and all the students in the classroom strained their ears for the answer,<br>
<br>
even as they continued working on their own practice problems.<br>
<br>
"Let me think…," Mahiru said. "In terms of absolute requirements, I suppose he would<br>
<br>
have to be a kind and honest person. I don't like dishonest people at all."<br>
<br>
"And what about appearance?"<br>
<br>
"I think what's inside is more important, so I'm not too particular about looks," Mahiru<br>
<br>
replied. "…But someone who keeps themselves tidy would be good."<br>
<br>
The answer that she gave, with a tender smile and look in her eye, was more about the<br>
<br>
kind of person she preferred than the kind of boy she liked, giving the impression that<br>
<br>
she was evading the question.<br>
<br>
The girls who had asked the question must have also felt that she was being vague,<br>
<br>
and they stared at Mahiru with a hint of disappointment on their faces. Mahiru smiled<br>
<br>
back at them as always, but this time, it was tinged with bitterness.<br>
<br>
"When I think about what else might be important, I guess… someone whose values<br>
<br>
match mine?"<br>
<br>
"Values? Not hobbies and stuff?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, values." Mahiru nodded. "I doubt they will ever match up perfectly, so I'm not<br>
<br>
expecting that, but I think it's important that we respect each other's values, even if<br>
<br>
they don't align. Someone who would never force their point of view, or try to change<br>
<br>
their partner… Yes, someone who appreciates their partner's ideas would be good. It<br>
<br>
would probably be best if it was someone who saw things the same way, but I like<br>
<br>
people who stand by their partner and accept their beliefs, even if they can't."<br>
<br>
Mahiru brought her speech to a finish with a gentle smile, and her gaze darted over to<br>
<br>
Amane for just a second.<br>
<br>
He reflexively averted his eyes, and Mahiru returned her focus to the group of girls<br>
<br>
with no change in her expression.<br>
<br>
Amane knew that the people around him would start to notice if he stared at Mahiru<br>
<br>
any longer, so he lowered his gaze to the notebook in his hands. But then he heard a<br>
<br>
quiet chuckle from beside him, from someone who had been watching his behavior.<br>
<br>
"And that's that, ladies and gentlemen."<br>
<br>
Itsuki had observed while everyone else had abruptly stopped working. The boys<br>
<br>
Itsuki and Amane were studying with seemed to realize what was going on, and they<br>
<br>
quickly went back to their own notebooks in an attempt to feign ignorance.<br>
<br>
Amane was turning pages and applying sticky notes as if nothing had happened, as he<br>
<br>
mulled over the idea of matching values.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was the type of person who could never date anyone casually, and if she was<br>
<br>
with someone for a long time, she would probably be thinking about settling down<br>
<br>
with them. That meant it was important that whoever she chose didn't make things<br>
<br>
difficult for her.<br>
<br>
"The angel has a really mature way of thinking about things, huh?" one of the other<br>
<br>
boys commented.<br>
<br>
"Well, I think Shiina's got a point," Amane mumbled. When everyone turned to look at<br>
<br>
him, he gave a strained smile. "It would be hard to spend time with somebody if their<br>
<br>
values didn't align with yours, and everyone wants to have someone by their side who<br>
<br>
accepts them, right? Even if you tried to get along with someone who held different<br>
<br>
values, eventually it would put too much stress on the relationship, and you'd break<br>
<br>
up. I think that logically, taking that into account from the start is better."<br>
<br>
Things would be even worse if your partner was the kind of person who couldn't tolerate<br>
<br>
differing opinions. The resulting stress would obviously hurt the relationship. So when it<br>
<br>
comes to dating someone with incompatible beliefs, it'd be best not to even bother.<br>
<br>
"You've got a strict way of thinking about it… I can't even imagine what your type is,<br>
<br>
Fujimiya."<br>
<br>
Amane shrugged. "Well, like everyone else, I'd prefer someone kind."<br>
<br>
"That's such a vague answer! There's no other criteria?"<br>
<br>
"I don't know what to say," he replied. "…Assuming that I get along with her, I think I'd<br>
<br>
like a girl who's gentle and sensible."<br>
<br>
"By that standard, you would like most girls."<br>
<br>
"Oh, shut up. Do you have some sort of problem with that?"<br>
<br>
"It's not that I have a problem, but it just feels like a very common opinion."<br>
<br>
"…All right, how about I say that whatever girl I fall for will be my preferred type?<br>
<br>
Whoever I like is my type at that moment."<br>
<br>
Amane was afraid that if he gave too many specifics, he would end up revealing who<br>
<br>
he liked, so he kept his answers as vague as possible to arousing any suspicion. From<br>
<br>
behind him, he heard someone let out a small giggle.<br>
<br>
"What an unexpectedly sweet thing for you to say."<br>
<br>
His body stiffened at the sound of a familiar voice.<br>
<br>
Amane wanted to ask her why she was over here and what exactly she had heard, but<br>
<br>
Mahiru coming over to his group wasn't particularly strange, nor was it weird that she<br>
<br>
would overhear what he said once she got close, so he swallowed his protests.<br>
<br>
Keeping a stony expression so as not to betray his feelings, Amane didn't even look in<br>
<br>
Mahiru's direction as he responded, "Sorry."<br>
<br>
Amane knew that it didn't give a very good impression to be so blunt with the class<br>
<br>
angel, but since he already had a reputation for being unsociable, nobody acted<br>
<br>
especially surprised.<br>
<br>
"Shiina…"<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry for showing up so late. I haven't been able to come over here much, but…<br>
<br>
are there any parts that you're having trouble understanding?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru had finally finished up on the other side of the room and made her way over<br>
<br>
to check on Amane's group. She sounded quite apologetic. Amane didn't know<br>
<br>
whether she was standing next to him on purpose or not, but it wasn't good for his<br>
<br>
heart.<br>
<br>
After the boys all looked at each other, one of them spoke up, looking sheepish.<br>
<br>
"Uh, actually, we got Fujimiya to tutor us. We should be the ones apologizing, for<br>
<br>
joining your study session so suddenly."<br>
<br>
"Oh, no, it's all right. It's my fault, really, for agreeing to tutor so many people without<br>
<br>
thinking about how much I can handle. I just couldn't keep up with everyone. But I'm<br>
<br>
relieved to hear that you got help from Fujimiya." She gave him a friendly smile and<br>
<br>
added, "Studying is one of Fujimiya's strong points."<br>
<br>
Amane felt extremely uncomfortable, but he didn't show his discomfort. "I am honored<br>
<br>
by the compliment," he replied stoically.<br>
<br>
Immediately after he said it, he looked up apologetically at Mahiru, worried that his<br>
<br>
comment might have sounded sarcastic, but Mahiru met his eyes with a smile and an<br>
<br>
affectionate look, as if to say that she understood everything.<br>
<br>
"Fujimiya is very helpful and good at teaching, you know," Mahiru insisted.<br>
<br>
"I… uh… I wouldn't really say that…," Amane stammered.<br>
<br>
"Oh, and what would you call this? Plus, it's easy to see the way you support Chitose<br>
<br>
and Akazawa, too. You act cold, but you're always watching out for them, right? You<br>
<br>
extend your hand as soon as you see someone's in trouble."<br>
<br>
Amane scowled when she said that it was "easy to see" him doing that, with such a<br>
<br>
gentle expression on her face.<br>
<br>
Mahiru did sometimes compliment Amane, but he never expected her to say<br>
<br>
something like that or praise him in a place like this. His eyes began to dart nervously<br>
<br>
around the room.<br>
<br>
"He's blushing, he's blushing!" Itsuki jeered.<br>
<br>
"Shut up, Itsuki… It's totally normal to support your friends."<br>
<br>
Mahiru smiled fondly at him. "I'm glad that it's become a normal thing for you."<br>
<br>
Finally, Amane couldn't endure it any longer, and he turned away.<br>
<br>
Under the desk, Itsuki kicked him lightly with the toe of his shoe, as if urging Amane<br>
<br>
on toward something.<br>
<br>
As the study session concluded, Amane rolled his shoulders gently to loosen up the<br>
<br>
stiffness that had gradually accumulated there.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was looking at him with her usual smile and a hint of deep affection—it was a<br>
<br>
look only someone close to her would recognize. Itsuki had noticed and started<br>
<br>
pestering Amane secretly under the desk again. The boys in their study group had also<br>
<br>
gotten used to Amane's presence and chatted openly with him as well.<br>
<br>
For better or worse, Amane was exhausted. It was a good thing to have made some<br>
<br>
friendly acquaintances, but it was somewhat difficult to do anything at all with Mahiru<br>
<br>
there.<br>
<br>
The other boys were finished studying too and returned the copies of Amane's notes<br>
<br>
with promises of candy and junk food to repay him for the help.<br>
<br>
Some of their classmates had left partway through, either because they had other<br>
<br>
things to do or because it was a more serious study session than they wanted, so<br>
<br>
Amane was secretly admiring the ones who had stayed for their diligence.<br>
<br>
"Sorry for making you wait. And after you helped me out, too."<br>
<br>
Mahiru stayed to the very end, to clean and tidy the classroom and return the key to<br>
<br>
the office. Other classmates had asked if she wanted to head home together, but as the<br>
<br>
organizer, she had various tasks to finish up, so she'd given them each a firm refusal<br>
<br>
and had been about to stay behind alone until Amane had stepped in. He told her that<br>
<br>
they had all used the classroom together, and it would surely be dangerous to let<br>
<br>
Mahiru head home on her own late at night, so he would stay with her.<br>
<br>
He wished that Itsuki and Chitose had been there to stay behind as well, though. He<br>
<br>
felt some minor frustration toward his friends, who had thoughtlessly ducked out<br>
<br>
earlier, as he and Mahiru walked down the deserted hallways together.<br>
<br>
Since club activities were temporarily on hold, and since the sun had already set, there<br>
<br>
were probably only a few teachers, office staff, and students left in the building. It<br>
<br>
wasn't good to be seen alone with Mahiru at school, but it was too late to change that.<br>
<br>
"No, no, I'm the one who should be apologizing," Amane insisted. "I might have gotten<br>
<br>
in your way instead."<br>
<br>
"Not at all; you really helped me out," Mahiru replied. "There was no way I could go<br>
<br>
around to everyone by myself. I never imagined so many people would show up… and<br>
<br>
there were some people who joined at the last minute, so there were way more than I<br>
<br>
expected."<br>
<br>
"I feel like that's not a big surprise, for the angel."<br>
<br>
"…Oh, come on."<br>
<br>
She shot him a look as a reminder that she didn't want him to call her by that<br>
<br>
nickname, which Amane let pass with feigned ignorance. It was his meager payback<br>
<br>
for her publicly complimenting him.<br>
<br>
"But it went well; everyone tackled the material seriously," she said.<br>
<br>
"There was a lot of chitchat throughout the room, but everyone was more serious than<br>
<br>
I expected. Even I was working hard to keep up."<br>
<br>
"You always take your studies seriously, Fujimiya. You seem even more motivated for<br>
<br>
this round of exams than you have before."<br>
<br>
"…I guess. I've been thinking I should put some more effort into certain things."<br>
<br>
Amane intended to do the best he could at studying and at exercise. At the moment,<br>
<br>
there was hardly anyone around, and he had a good reason to be accompanying<br>
<br>
Mahiru, so he stayed by her side. However, Amane wanted to become someone who<br>
<br>
could be with her without needing a reason and not worry about people talking.<br>
<br>
Mahiru, who he was sure had no idea of the deeper reasons behind Amane's efforts,<br>
<br>
smiled at him and said, "How admirable." They had just arrived at the entry hall, and<br>
<br>
she turned to look at their surroundings. "The sun's already gone down, hasn't it?"<br>
<br>
"Sure has," Amane agreed.<br>
<br>
He noticed her staring at him.<br>
<br>
She wasn't wearing her usual angelic smile, but rather the more intimate and slightly<br>
<br>
expectant one that she often showed him when they were alone together.<br>
<br>
Amane hesitated, briefly unsure of what she wanted. Though from their previous<br>
<br>
conversations, he managed to guess what she was thinking and put on a slight smile.<br>
<br>
"…It's late, so I'll walk you home."<br>
<br>
Evidently, he guessed correctly, because Mahiru's porcelain cheeks flushed slightly,<br>
<br>
turning the color of roses, and her lips gently curled up.<br>
<br>
"Thank you for being so thoughtful," she said. "It's very kind of you."<br>
<br>
"Are you making fun of me? You basically just told me what to do…," he muttered<br>
<br>
quietly.<br>
<br>
"Heh-heh."<br>
<br>
Apparently Mahiru had heard what he said, and she crinkled her eyes like she found<br>
<br>
it funny. "You dummy," she teased, before changing her shoes and heading out the front<br>
<br>
door. Since they were supposed to be walking together, Amane slowed down to match<br>
<br>
Mahiru's pace and let out a deliberate sigh.<br>
<br>
…I bet it's pretty obvious.<br>
<br>
It was clear that he had stayed behind so late in order to wait for Mahiru so that she<br>
<br>
wouldn't have to go home alone.<br>
<br>
Only, it wasn't good for them to be alone together in public, so he had intended to walk<br>
<br>
behind or ahead of her, not side by side. Except now that she had anticipated it and<br>
<br>
manipulated him into escorting her, there was no way he could say no to her.<br>
<br>
"…You're a girl, Miss Shiina, so you shouldn't go home too late, you know."<br>
<br>
"How kind of you to say so. Usually, I get home safely, and today I have you with me,<br>
<br>
Mr. Fujimiya, so I feel extra safe."<br>
<br>
"…Indeed."<br>
<br>
Illuminated by the dim, unreliable streetlights, Mahiru's smile looked brighter than<br>
<br>
the bulbs themselves, and Amane averted his eyes to avoid being dazzled.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 44: Studying with Everyone<br>
<br>
"Good morning, Fujimiya!"<br>
<br>
"Morning."<br>
<br>
The boys who had been in Amane's study group the day before greeted him breezily<br>
<br>
the following morning. Incidentally, Mahiru had been in high spirits the whole walk<br>
<br>
home and the rest of the night after they got back to their apartments.<br>
<br>
Amane returned his classmates' morning greetings with a slight wave and set his bag<br>
<br>
down at his desk. Itsuki and Yuuta, who had both arrived before Amane, ambled over,<br>
<br>
smiling. Itsuki seemed to have a touch of Chitose's wicked scheming about him, and<br>
<br>
Amane didn't think it was his imagination.<br>
<br>
Predictably, Itsuki's grin changed to a smug smirk. Amane almost clicked his tongue<br>
<br>
in irritation.<br>
<br>
"How'd yesterday go?" Itsuki asked.<br>
<br>
"Nothing really to report. And definitely nothing to warrant that dumb grin."<br>
<br>
"Oh right, you guys had that study session, didn't you?" Yuuta said. "I had something<br>
<br>
else to do, so I couldn't make it. Did anything happen?"<br>
<br>
Yuuta hadn't been there, so he didn't seem to know the reason behind Itsuki's smug<br>
<br>
expression.<br>
<br>
Amane didn't feel like going to the trouble of explaining, so he shrugged and made a<br>
<br>
face at Itsuki that conveyed mostly annoyance and frustration. "No, not really. We just<br>
<br>
had a normal, solid study session."<br>
<br>
"Oh, come on…," Itsuki prodded. "Nothing to say about my brilliant setup?"<br>
<br>
"It was none of your business anyway, that's for sure."<br>
<br>
Amane had been planning to escort Mahiru home (really, since their destinations were<br>
<br>
basically the same, it would be more accurate to say he was also going home)<br>
<br>
regardless of whether Itsuki had left first or not. Amane probably wouldn't have felt<br>
<br>
so awkward or been so worried about attracting attention, and it would have<br>
<br>
obviously been more comfortable if Itsuki and Chitose had tagged along.<br>
<br>
"I'm fine," Amane insisted. "I'm making steady progress at my own pace, and I don't<br>
<br>
need any encouragement."<br>
<br>
"I'm pushing you because I'm starting to get impatient, though…," Itsuki whined.<br>
<br>
"Shut up. Or I won't let you copy my notes."<br>
<br>
"Ah! This is where I must withdraw. I shall spare you this time." 2<br>
<br>
"You're infuriating."<br>
<br>
Itsuki was the one in trouble, now that exams were drawing near and there was no<br>
<br>
more time left. Itsuki would probably do fine even without much studying, but he had<br>
<br>
said himself that it would be impossible for him to pass any of his weak subjects<br>
<br>
without at least some preparation.<br>
<br>
When Amane took the copy of notes out of his file folder and handed them over, he<br>
<br>
teased, "Victory is mine," but was doubtful whether Itsuki would study hard once he<br>
<br>
got home.<br>
<br>
Amane went to give copies of his notes to the boys who had greeted him earlier—they<br>
<br>
had requested them the day before. As thanks, they gave him candy until his hands<br>
<br>
were full.<br>
<br>
"You're a very caring dude," Itsuki remarked as Amane returned to his desk carrying<br>
<br>
heaps of snacks. Itsuki seemed like he was about to launch into a story about Mahiru's<br>
<br>
praise for Amane the day before.<br>
<br>
Amane could feel his face begin to twitch as he cut Itsuki off—"You didn't offer me<br>
<br>
anything, so I just made your copy along with the others."<br>
<br>
Yuuta had been watching with a smile as always, but suddenly he made a disappointed<br>
<br>
face. "I should have participated yesterday. It sounds like it was pretty fun. I wanted to<br>
<br>
study with everyone, too."<br>
<br>
"Well, Itsuki had fun messing with me," Amane said, "but I didn't have any fun being<br>
<br>
messed with."<br>
<br>
"This again?"<br>
<br>
"Now, now. Itsuki's teasing comes from a place of love," Yuuta jested. "Probably. I<br>
<br>
think."<br>
<br>
"Why must you all doubt me so?"<br>
<br>
"He gets sullen sometimes when you tease him too much, and it makes me wonder<br>
<br>
whether there's love behind the jokes or not. You've got to dial it back at times, you<br>
<br>
know? Fujimiya will probably forgive you eventually, but you'd better figure out where<br>
<br>
the line is before you cross it."<br>
<br>
"Yeah, sure, no problem. I know exactly where the line is."<br>
<br>
"This guy pisses me off," Amane muttered.<br>
<br>
Itsuki had never teased Amane to the point of crossing any lines or making him truly<br>
<br>
angry. Even if Amane pouted a little bit, he was never really offended, and Itsuki always<br>
<br>
stopped when Amane clapped back in irritation, and he never complained when he<br>
<br>
got a particularly pointed retort, either. He probably knew where the line was.<br>
<br>
Itsuki's knack at dancing around that line was impressive and a singular point of<br>
<br>
irritation in Amane's life.<br>
<br>
"Well now, I suppose Itsuki has always been a little… irritating," Yuuta admitted.<br>
<br>
"How can you be so casually cruel, Yuuta? Who knew you were such a harsh critic?"<br>
<br>
"I've recently decided that I can stand to be a bit harsh with you sometimes."<br>
<br>
"You monster! I protest!"<br>
<br>
"Ah-ha-ha!"<br>
<br>
Yuuta laughed it off as Itsuki faked a pose of indignation; it was obvious that he wasn't<br>
<br>
actually upset. Amane felt satisfied to see Itsuki on the receiving end of the jokes for<br>
<br>
once, on several levels.<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't hate him, even at times like this, so he secretly had on a wry smile.<br>
<br>
"So let's just set Itsuki aside for a moment…," Yuuta said.<br>
<br>
"Don't leave me out!" he protested.<br>
<br>
"We won't get anywhere with you jabbering on, Itsuki, so be quiet for a minute. Now,<br>
<br>
Amane, I'd also like to study together, the three of us. Want to have a study session on<br>
<br>
Saturday or Sunday?"<br>
<br>
Itsuki obediently shut his mouth tight like a certain cartoon rabbit, and Yuuta turned<br>
<br>
away from him to ask Amane again, "How about it?"<br>
<br>
Amane didn't have anything in particular planned for the weekend, and he figured that<br>
<br>
with Yuuta there, it would probably be a normal study session, so he was inclined to<br>
<br>
agree, but then he hesitated.<br>
<br>
Amane thought a study session sounded fine, but there was the question of where to<br>
<br>
hold it.<br>
<br>
"…So where would we do it?"<br>
<br>
"Ah, my place is out," Itsuki responded. "My parents will be there, so I think it'll be<br>
<br>
awkward, or there might be an unpleasant atmosphere." Itsuki's tone was casual, but<br>
<br>
Amane could tell that his friend was upset about the poor relationship he had with his<br>
<br>
parents.<br>
<br>
"…My house would be fine, I guess, but my older sisters will probably get in our way a<br>
<br>
little, so I don't think it's well-suited for studying," Yuuta said.<br>
<br>
"You've got sisters?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, two of them. They're kind of loud, pushy people, so I think Fujimiya would<br>
<br>
probably be uncomfortable."<br>
<br>
Amane knew that Yuuta was probably not downplaying it or anything, that his sisters<br>
<br>
really were those kinds of girls. If he had to guess, Amane got the feeling that they<br>
<br>
were the type he couldn't handle, so he thought it best to avoid Yuuta's house if<br>
<br>
possible.<br>
<br>
That meant Amane's place would be the most convenient.<br>
<br>
Itsuki had been to his apartment many times before, and Amane didn't have any<br>
<br>
objections to the idea of Yuuta coming in. At the same time, Amane wasn't the only<br>
<br>
person who spent time in that apartment.<br>
<br>
Mahiru wasn't necessarily always in his apartment, but she was kind enough to come<br>
<br>
over and cook, and they had been studying together a lot recently, so there was a high<br>
<br>
probability that she would be there over the weekend.<br>
<br>
Amane smiled vaguely, thinking that he'd better not bring guests over without getting<br>
<br>
Mahiru's permission first.<br>
<br>
"Do you think you could ask her about it?" Itsuki asked.<br>
<br>
"Ah, sure, I can do that." Amane nodded. "We can't just barge in without warning."<br>
<br>
"It is your little love nest, after all…"<br>
<br>
"Seriously, shut your mouth."<br>
<br>
Amane glared at Itsuki, wondering what he would do if they were overheard, but<br>
<br>
Itsuki had kept his voice low enough, and none of their classmates seemed to be<br>
<br>
looking their way.<br>
<br>
Amane gave an exasperated sigh and cast his eyes downward, thinking of Mahiru, who<br>
<br>
was not currently in the classroom.<br>
<br>
"Hey, Mahiru? I'm going to have a study session at my place with Itsuki and Kadowaki<br>
<br>
tomorrow morning. Is that all right?"<br>
<br>
After dinner, as he was carrying the dishes over to the sink, Amane posed the question<br>
<br>
to Mahiru, who was carrying the silverware.<br>
<br>
Itsuki had said that Saturday was better for his schedule. Amane felt bad about asking<br>
<br>
at the last minute.<br>
<br>
Mahiru blinked dramatically once, then gave him an encouraging look.<br>
<br>
"I don't mind. Should I make food for everyone?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, I would feel bad asking you to do so much, but… but I'd be grateful if you could…<br>
<br>
Is that all right?"<br>
<br>
"It's just a matter of making a bit more. I don't mind," she answered casually.<br>
<br>
Amane was certain that it would still take a lot of extra labor. She'd probably planned<br>
<br>
on making lunch for herself anyway, but nevertheless, he wouldn't be able to thank<br>
<br>
Mahiru enough for adjusting her plans to match up with his.<br>
<br>
"Can I study with you, too?"<br>
<br>
"If you want to, the guys said it was fine… Should we call Chitose, too? I don't know<br>
<br>
whether she's free or not, or whether she's really going to study, but I feel a little<br>
<br>
anxious about leaving her out."<br>
<br>
Chitose wasn't very studious. It wasn't that she didn't know how to study, but Amane<br>
<br>
certainly wouldn't call her an academic. Though she had participated in the previous<br>
<br>
day's study session, apparently, she hadn't made much progress, and she had even<br>
<br>
laughed about how she was going to fail the tests. 4<br>
<br>
"You don't need to worry about that. I've already invited her."<br>
<br>
"Huh?"<br>
<br>
"Well, she was saying that she'll get told off by her father if she doesn't get a good score,<br>
<br>
for her anyway, on this round of tests, so just today, I made plans to study with her on<br>
<br>
Saturday."<br>
<br>
"Maybe joining us was Chitose's plan all along?"<br>
<br>
Amane had a feeling that Itsuki had told Chitose about their study party, but he had no<br>
<br>
definitive proof. He smiled wryly at the thought of his two meddling friends, convinced<br>
<br>
that she had gotten her information through Itsuki.<br>
<br>
Wishing they had just told him the plan from the start, he quickly rinsed the oily plates<br>
<br>
in hot water and began washing the dishes. Mahiru giggled a little and started packing<br>
<br>
the cooled leftovers away in Tupperware.<br>
<br>
"Well, whether that was her original aim or not, it looks like it will be a very lively<br>
<br>
study session, huh?" she remarked.<br>
<br>
"Will that be all right for you? If it gets a bit loud?"<br>
<br>
"I'll be fine," Mahiru insisted. "Besides, I've been studying every day, so I'm not that<br>
<br>
anxious about the tests."<br>
<br>
Mahiru didn't need to worry, because she worked hard every day, so Amane didn't<br>
<br>
really think anything more of it.<br>
<br>
Though he did wonder how the group was going to manage to study efficiently.<br>
<br>
"Hey, Mahiru, after we're done, could I look at your notes?"<br>
<br>
"Sure, I don't mind. But you take nice notes too, Amane. They're popular, I hear."<br>
<br>
"My notes are, sure. I guess because they're fairly neat. But I'm curious about the notes<br>
<br>
of the top-ranking student."<br>
<br>
"Don't get your hopes up because they're not as good as you're expecting."<br>
<br>
Mahiru giggled again and put the leftovers in the refrigerator.<br>
<br>
They would become Amane's breakfast the next day, so as he did the washing up, in<br>
<br>
his mind, he thanked Mahiru. He was able to eat her home cooking not only for dinner,<br>
<br>
but even for breakfast, improving his daily life, knowing that he was eating healthily<br>
<br>
every day.<br>
<br>
"Amane, you're studying really hard for these exams, aren't you?"<br>
<br>
"Well, I'd like to improve my confidence in a few areas, and I figure if I'm going to go<br>
<br>
to the trouble of studying, I should really work hard at it. I'd like to score in the top<br>
<br>
ten."<br>
<br>
"Is that so…? All right, then how about I give you a little motivation, then?"<br>
<br>
"Motivation?"<br>
<br>
"If you do make it into the top ten, I'll do anything you ask." 1<br>
<br>
"…Huh?"<br>
<br>
Amane froze for a second and nearly dropped the plate he was holding into the sink.<br>
<br>
He couldn't believe what he'd just heard. 2<br>
<br>
Almost breaking one of Mahiru's favorite plates brought Amane back to his senses,<br>
<br>
and he took a deep breath.<br>
<br>
Then he glanced over beside him and saw Mahiru, wearing her usual placid smile,<br>
<br>
snapping the lid onto one of the containers.<br>
<br>
"I said before that I would do basically anything if you just asked, but I figure this time,<br>
<br>
we can make it a real prize. I'll grant you any wish, even something you would never<br>
<br>
normally ask, okay?"<br>
<br>
"…Girls shouldn't say things like that."<br>
<br>
"Oh, are you going to ask me to do something dangerous?"<br>
<br>
Though she must have been entirely aware that Amane would never do any such thing,<br>
<br>
Mahiru tilted her head teasingly as she asked, and Amane couldn't help but frown. She<br>
<br>
seemed confident that there would be no great danger in anything that Amane might<br>
<br>
request.<br>
<br>
When Amane stared at Mahiru, she gave him a bemused smile and bounced over to<br>
<br>
stand beside him. He couldn't tell whether it was his imagination, but a hopeful look<br>
<br>
seemed to have flashed across her face.<br>
<br>
"…Supposing I did ask for something dangerous, what would you do?"<br>
<br>
"Well, that would depend on what it was, but I think… I would admire your chivalry<br>
<br>
and probably grant your wish." 3<br>
<br>
It sounded like Mahiru did mean to fulfill Amane's request. Of course, that was probably<br>
<br>
because she was sure that he wouldn't force her to do anything unreasonable. Amane<br>
<br>
felt somewhat conflicted.<br>
<br>
He didn't want to force her to do anything she didn't want to, but hearing the girl he<br>
<br>
liked tell him that she would do anything he wanted gave him all sorts of wild ideas—<br>
<br>
none of which he could say out loud.<br>
<br>
He took a quick look at Mahiru and saw her smiling as if to say she was ready for<br>
<br>
anything. She looked so innocent. Amane felt skewered by his own wretchedness.<br>
<br>
"…All right, I want you to let me lie in your lap, like you did before." 2<br>
<br>
Amane just barely held it together. After some deliberation, he made up his mind and<br>
<br>
asked for something that he knew Mahiru was likely to agree to, and that he would in<br>
<br>
general never request.<br>
<br>
He wanted to experience that pleasant feeling one more time. It didn't seem like an<br>
<br>
outrageous request, and Amane figured he could keep ahold of himself.<br>
<br>
The moment he said it, Amane felt miserably embarrassed at his own request. Mahiru<br>
<br>
looked back at him, blinking repeatedly, and stared at Amane's face.<br>
<br>
Then, with an adorable, bashful look, she answered, "Okay by me. I'll throw in an ear<br>
<br>
cleaning for you, so prepare to be pampered."<br>
<br>
She puffed out her chest, looking like she had no doubt Amane would make it into the<br>
<br>
top ten.<br>
<br>
"We're here!"<br>
<br>
The Saturday before the tests, as planned, Itsuki, Chitose, and Yuuta showed up around<br>
<br>
ten in the morning, called out a greeting in unison from the doorway, and shuffled over<br>
<br>
the threshold.<br>
<br>
Apparently, the three of them had grown up in the same neighborhood, and it had been<br>
<br>
convenient for them to meet up before coming over. They met up first also because<br>
<br>
Yuuta didn't know where Amane's apartment was, but the main reason was probably<br>
<br>
because they were already good friends.<br>
<br>
Amane welcomed them. "Great, come on in."<br>
<br>
"Where's Mahiru?" Chitose asked.<br>
<br>
"In the kitchen, getting lunch ready."<br>
<br>
So that they didn't have to worry about their midday meal, Mahiru had come over to<br>
<br>
Amane's apartment ahead of time to prepare it. She had made a trip to a supermarket<br>
<br>
that opened early in the morning to buy the ingredients.<br>
<br>
She was making roast beef and wanted to let it slowly cook so that by lunch, it would<br>
<br>
be just the right tenderness and ready to eat.<br>
<br>
"…You two are getting awfully comfortable…," Itsuki whispered.<br>
<br>
"Shut up."<br>
<br>
"You guys are like a newlyweds, welcoming your colleagues over for a meal."<br>
<br>
"One more word, and you won't get any lunch," Amane threatened.<br>
<br>
"No way! I'm eating Mahiru's cooking!"<br>
<br>
Warning Itsuki to keep his mischief to a minimum, Amane looked over at Yuuta, who<br>
<br>
was staring at him, slightly astonished.<br>
<br>
"What's up, Yuuta?"<br>
<br>
"…It's just, Shiina seems so at home here in your apartment, Fujimiya," he replied.<br>
<br>
"…It'd almost be weirder if she wasn't," Amane grumbled. "…Since she's always making<br>
<br>
food for me."<br>
<br>
Amane turned away abruptly and saw Itsuki grinning with his hands over his mouth.<br>
<br>
It reminded him of the way his mother smiled, which made him angry, and he kicked<br>
<br>
Itsuki lightly in the shin.<br>
<br>
"Welcome, everyone…," Mahiru said as she emerged from the kitchen. "Oh, Akazawa,<br>
<br>
what happened?"<br>
<br>
Amane scoffed. "Don't worry about him."<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked worried about Itsuki, who seemed to be wearing a mysterious smile. It<br>
<br>
wasn't anything she needed to worry about, and Amane wished she would just ignore<br>
<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Mahiru seemed to conclude that Itsuki's expression was nothing to be concerned<br>
<br>
about, so even though she still looked curious, she put on her usual smile and returned<br>
<br>
to the kitchen with a flutter of her apron. "I've got a little more preparation to do in<br>
<br>
there, so please go ahead into the living room."<br>
<br>
Watching her leave, Itsuki mumbled, "She is absolutely brimming with just-married<br>
<br>
wife energy." This time, Amane slapped him on the back. 1<br>
<br>
They waited for Mahiru to finish her work in the kitchen, and after she was done, she<br>
<br>
brought out tea. "Well, should we get to studying?" she asked, taking a seat next to<br>
<br>
Amane. The other three had made sure to leave that spot open.<br>
<br>
"Yeah!"<br>
<br>
"All right, what parts don't you understand, Chitose? We covered English yesterday<br>
<br>
and were planning to work on math today, right?"<br>
<br>
"Everything," Chitose replied.<br>
<br>
Mahiru balked. "E-everything…?"<br>
<br>
"Chi is not very good at math," Itsuki commented. "She barely avoided failing last time."<br>
<br>
Chitose wasn't completely hopeless, but that was her weakest subject, and she<br>
<br>
announced after every test that only divine intervention had kept her from failing.<br>
<br>
The word "everything" caused Mahiru's cheek to twitch slightly, but since math was<br>
<br>
Chitose's weakness, there really was no helping it. They would be lucky if she managed<br>
<br>
to understand the basics.<br>
<br>
"She has a hard time with applied problems, so the best thing would be to show her<br>
<br>
how to use the formulas with each exercise, I think," Itsuki said.<br>
<br>
"Is she all right on the formulas?" Mahiru asked Itsuki.<br>
<br>
"…You're okay there, right?" Itsuki asked Chitose.<br>
<br>
"Probably." Chitose nodded.<br>
<br>
Amane got the feeling that Chitose was not actually okay, and that Mahiru had her<br>
<br>
work cut out for her. Chitose wasn't exactly dumb; she just couldn't solve the problems<br>
<br>
because she didn't know how to use the formulas. So as long as she learned how, she<br>
<br>
ought to be able to get a decent score, for her anyway.<br>
<br>
"You almost seem motivated now, Itsuki," Amane observed.<br>
<br>
"Ha-ha-ha!"<br>
<br>
"Don't try to laugh it off; get to studying."<br>
<br>
Why do you think we organized this study session? Amane thought to himself.<br>
<br>
"Yuuutaaa, Amane's being mean!" Itsuki whined playfully.<br>
<br>
"You'd better shape up soon, then."<br>
<br>
With a bright smile, Yuuta refused to rescue Itsuki, who let his shoulders droop<br>
<br>
dejectedly.<br>
<br>
Yuuta himself had already studiously opened his textbook and notebook to get started.<br>
<br>
Amane wished that Itsuki and Chitose would follow his example.<br>
<br>
Yuuta didn't seem to have any particularly weak subjects. He was an outstanding<br>
<br>
student who had above-average scores across the board.<br>
<br>
Amane also wasn't worried about any subject in particular—all he had left was to<br>
<br>
polish up his memorization and application skills.<br>
<br>
He entrusted the task of tutoring Chitose to Mahiru and lowered his gaze to the world<br>
<br>
history textbook that he had set out for himself.<br>
<br>
Amane and the others continued studying after lunch, but eventually, around
<p></p>
mid-afternoon, Chitose seemed to reach the limits of her concentration <br>
<br>
and leaned back in her chair. "I'm exhausted! Hey, Amane, could we play a video game?"<br>
<br>
"You're free to play if you want, but I can't make any promises about your grades…"<br>
<br>
"Geez, you're so strict."<br>
<br>
"It's because you never just play a little bit. If you think you can control yourself, then<br>
<br>
I suppose you can go ahead," he replied while solving a workbook problem, signaling<br>
<br>
that he was going to continue studying. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Chitose<br>
<br>
puff out her cheeks a little.<br>
<br>
Amane had predicted it was only a matter of time before Chitose got bored of studying,<br>
<br>
an activity he knew she hated. That was why he had put four controllers and several<br>
<br>
games beside the console in his TV stand.<br>
<br>
A human's attention span can only last so long, so he figured it wouldn't be so bad for<br>
<br>
his friends to play and take a breather.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, Amane had no problem studying some more. Since they started, he<br>
<br>
took a short break every hour, and in the first place, he didn't mind studying. He could<br>
<br>
keep going for quite a long time if he wanted to.<br>
<br>
"You're no fun, Amane!" Chitose huffed.<br>
<br>
"This is supposed to be a study party, right? I guess it's fine if you really want to play.<br>
<br>
I've got four controllers, so how about you take a short break?"<br>
<br>
"Okay, I'll accept your offer, but… you shouldn't push yourself too hard, okay?"<br>
<br>
"I've been taking breaks."<br>
<br>
"What a dedicated student! You've always been so serious, Amane. All right, then, I'm<br>
<br>
gonna game. Let's play, Itsuki."<br>
<br>
"Yeah, sure. But we can't waste all of our time."<br>
<br>
Amane was not surprised that Itsuki also seemed tired after the three or so hours of<br>
<br>
studying and was keen to play a game.<br>
<br>
"Wanna join, Yuuta?" he asked.<br>
<br>
"Sure, why not? Is it all right, Fujimiya?"<br>
<br>
"Mmm." Amane nodded.<br>
<br>
Even Yuuta, who was more serious about his studies than Itsuki or Chitose, was<br>
<br>
showing interest in taking a short break. Amane confirmed that Yuuta was free to join<br>
<br>
the others, then looked back down at his workbook.<br>
<br>
Beside him, Mahiru was quietly working on solving a set of problems. She was as<br>
<br>
focused as before and showed no signs of stopping.<br>
<br>
"You're not going to play, Mahiru?" he asked her.<br>
<br>
"I'm going to study a little more," Mahiru replied.<br>
<br>
"I see."<br>
<br>
Amane had vowed to start taking his studies seriously, which was the only reason he<br>
<br>
wasn't stopping, but Mahiru had a natural affinity for studying, and he couldn't help<br>
<br>
but admire her diligence.<br>
<br>
She'd probably continue ranking first place on the exams since she never failed to put<br>
<br>
in the effort—that dedication was just another reason why Mahiru was so incredible.<br>
<br>
After watching the other three excitedly get up from the table and start taking up<br>
<br>
positions in front of the television, Amane put them out of his mind and went back to<br>
<br>
work. He could hear pencil lead scratching against paper, the sound of the eraser<br>
<br>
rubbing out the marks, and, very clearly, the sound of Mahiru's breathing at his side.<br>
<br>
While listening half-heartedly to the animated voices of his friends nearby, Amane<br>
<br>
focused on remembering which questions the teachers tended to choose for exams.<br>
<br>
Several of his teachers had been teaching him since his first year of high school, and<br>
<br>
he knew that those teachers' tests were relatively easy. And from their personalities<br>
<br>
and the way they conducted their classes, he could guess what sections of the material<br>
<br>
they would pull from, especially since he remembered their style from the previous<br>
<br>
year. Amane felt pretty certain that he could predict what they would put on their<br>
<br>
tests.<br>
<br>
He had even told Chitose about which sections of the textbook the test questions<br>
<br>
would most likely cover. It was just a calculated guess, but he had never been wrong<br>
<br>
before, so if she prioritized those areas when she studied, she would probably at least<br>
<br>
avoid failing.<br>
<br>
"Amane, here."<br>
<br>
While he was solving problems in silence, Mahiru had stood up unnoticed, and now<br>
<br>
she set a cup of coffee down in front of him.<br>
<br>
He smiled at the beverage, which he guessed had one small sugar cube and a single<br>
<br>
portion of milk stirred in.<br>
<br>
"The usual is all right, yeah?"<br>
<br>
"Mm. Thank you."<br>
<br>
They had been spending time together for half a year, so they had gotten to know each<br>
<br>
other's tastes.<br>
<br>
Feeling grateful toward Mahiru, who had brought the coffee over right when he started<br>
<br>
to get a craving, Amane wrapped his fingers around the mug handle, then realized that<br>
<br>
she had also placed a small plate before him.<br>
<br>
"What's this?"<br>
<br>
"A financier. I baked them yesterday, thinking we would need some sugar to fuel our<br>
<br>
brains."<br>
<br>
On the little plate sat one bite-sized financier, baked to a perfect golden brown. A<br>
<br>
toothpick stuck out of the top of the small cake, so that he could pick it up without<br>
<br>
getting his fingers dirty. Mahiru had probably made them bite-size so that they could<br>
<br>
be enjoyed in the spare moments between studying.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had also dutifully set out cakes for Itsuki and the others still playing the video<br>
<br>
game. Theirs were slightly larger and served on plates that sat together on a platter.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had also prepared coffee for the three of them, but the milk and sugar were<br>
<br>
self-serve, with sugar packets and little pots of cream laid out on the platter.<br>
<br>
With a smile, she quietly approached the gamers and set the tray down on a table<br>
<br>
nearby. "You should all have some, too."<br>
<br>
"Wow! Thank you, Mahiru!"<br>
<br>
"Oh, snacks! Perfect timing, too. Thank you, Shiina."<br>
<br>
"It's nothing, really."<br>
<br>
Mahiru returned to the table, gazing happily at the trio now enjoying their snack time,<br>
<br>
and Amane felt his lips curling into a smile as well.<br>
<br>
"…I sort of feel like I made you prepare a lot of stuff."<br>
<br>
"No, I did it because I wanted to," Mahiru insisted. "And I did everything in between<br>
<br>
studying, so it was a good way to take breaks."<br>
<br>
"You're the type of person who always goes all out, seriously."<br>
<br>
"…I just use my time on the people I want to use it on."<br>
<br>
Amane felt a hot lump rising up in his throat when she mumbled these words in a<br>
<br>
quiet voice.<br>
<br>
He washed it down with a swig of coffee. Mahiru hadn't added any extra sugar, but it<br>
<br>
somehow seemed particularly sweet.<br>
<br>
The sweetness wasn't unpleasant, and he wasn't sure how he should respond to what<br>
<br>
Mahiru had said, so Amane stared back down at his workbook, to fool himself into<br>
<br>
thinking he had nothing to say.<br>
<br>
In the end, the gaming tournament lasted well into the evening.<br>
<br>
Amane eventually took a break from his studies and joined in, too, when he found that<br>
<br>
he could no longer focus. Except it wasn't just the fatigue of hours of study that affected<br>
<br>
Amane's concentration.<br>
<br>
What did she mean, she uses her energy on the people she wants to use it on?<br>
<br>
Amane had been replaying Mahiru's quiet murmuring over and over again in his head.<br>
<br>
He had always known that Mahiru did things for the people she liked, but when she<br>
<br>
put it that way, it sounded like she held some special affection for Amane.<br>
<br>
Amane certainly thought that Mahiru liked him, but his understanding was that it<br>
<br>
wasn't in a romantic way. 1<br>
<br>
The way she'd said that made him wonder if she was doing everything because she<br>
<br>
liked him, not as a friend… His mind was running wild with the idea.<br>
<br>
I mean, I would understand if she was doing all this work because I'm such a failure of a<br>
<br>
human being, and she felt like she just had to step in, but…<br>
<br>
In fact, Amane was bad enough at housework that he couldn't rule out the possibility.<br>
<br>
He could survive on his own, if he really tried, but he did rely on Mahiru a lot.<br>
<br>
He couldn't decide whether Mahiru just wanted to look after him, or whether she was<br>
<br>
being overly caring because she was into him. Given his feelings for her, Amane would<br>
<br>
have liked to imagine that it was the latter, and he didn't think that it was completely<br>
<br>
hopeless. However, he still had serious doubts about whether he was the kind of<br>
<br>
person Mahiru could ever actually love.<br>
<br>
"…Amane? You fell out of the ring."<br>
<br>
"Huh…?"<br>
<br>
Amane had gotten lost in thought in the middle of a game, and unknowingly let his<br>
<br>
character go out of bounds. Since he didn't have any more lives left, he was knocked<br>
<br>
out of the game.<br>
<br>
A close match unfolded between Itsuki, Chitose, and Yuuta. Amane hadn't expected<br>
<br>
Yuuta to be so good at video games.<br>
<br>
Normally, Amane would never make such an obvious mistake. That was how<br>
<br>
distracted he was by Mahiru's comment.<br>
<br>
"Your concentration must really be shot from studying, Amane. You're spaced out."<br>
<br>
"…Must be," Amane agreed. "Mahiru, you want in on the next game?"<br>
<br>
"No, I've got to get dinner ready soon, so…"<br>
<br>
Mahiru glanced at the clock, and when Amane followed her gaze, he saw that it was<br>
<br>
just short of seven o'clock. It was probably a little bit late to start dinner preparations.<br>
<br>
"Oh, she's right, it's already so late… I've got to get going. I can't stay over, after all,"<br>
<br>
Chitose said.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, I'm sure you would have liked to stay at Shiina's place, Chi, but we didn't bring<br>
<br>
you a change of clothes or anything. Plus, you didn't ask, and I doubt you would fit into<br>
<br>
any of her clothes, after all…"<br>
<br>
"Tell me, my darling Itsuki, just what do you mean by that?"<br>
<br>
"I'm talking about your heights, of course, yes."<br>
<br>
Mahiru giggled as she watched the couple cheerfully bicker, as they always did. "Come<br>
<br>
over and stay next time."<br>
<br>
"You sure?"<br>
<br>
"I'm sure. As long as you tell me ahead of time."<br>
<br>
"Well then, I'll stay over at Amane's at the same time," Itsuki added.<br>
<br>
Amane frowned. "I have a feeling you're just angling for a meal…"<br>
<br>
"You got me. Her cooking is just too delicious!" Itsuki laughed, with no ill intent.<br>
<br>
With a sigh, Amane told him, "You know you've got to ask Mahiru, right?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru would be the one who had to make all the extra food, so Amane couldn't very<br>
<br>
well volunteer her.<br>
<br>
If she didn't agree, then the boys could eat out or get convenience store food, which<br>
<br>
would feel more like a party anyway, so it wouldn't be the worst thing.<br>
<br>
Mahiru nodded her approval with a smile, and Amane had a feeling Chitose and Itsuki<br>
<br>
would be staying over soon.<br>
<br>
"Will Kadowaki be coming next time, too?" Mahiru asked.<br>
<br>
"Oh, could I?"<br>
<br>
"Well…," Amane began.<br>
<br>
"If you come, let's have a 'kick Amane's butt into gear' party!" Itsuki interrupted.<br>
<br>
"Hey, where do you get off planning weird parties?"<br>
<br>
"Come on, how 'bout it?"<br>
<br>
Amane's cheek twitched as Itsuki put on a broad grin. Yuuta was taken aback for a<br>
<br>
moment but then smiled with relief.<br>
<br>
"Hey, Mahiru?… What did you mean when you said that you use your energy on the<br>
<br>
people you want to use it on?"<br>
<br>
While they were standing in the entryway after seeing everybody else off, Amane<br>
<br>
falteringly asked her the question that had been weighing on his mind all evening.<br>
<br>
He had been wavering over whether to ask her about it, but he had been grumbling<br>
<br>
about not knowing what to do as Itsuki left, and Itsuki had given him a little kick and<br>
<br>
said, "Don't worry about it, man, just ask."<br>
<br>
Amane hadn't been expecting a literal "kick in the butt," so he'd smacked Itsuki in<br>
<br>
retaliation. Itsuki hadn't seemed particularly likely to learn his lesson, so it had felt<br>
<br>
like a futile gesture.<br>
<br>
Mahiru blinked at Amane. Slowly, the corners of her mouth curled into a smile. "…What<br>
<br>
do you think I meant?"<br>
<br>
"Like, that you can't let this useless guy out of your sight for a minute?"<br>
<br>
Amane was too self-conscious to say anything rash, as he didn't want to come off as<br>
<br>
arrogant.<br>
<br>
"Heh-heh, well, that's true. I'm afraid to take my eye off you. If I wasn't here, you'd<br>
<br>
really be in trouble."<br>
<br>
"I can't argue with that."<br>
<br>
Mahiru truly did take extremely good care of him. If she wasn't around, Amane would<br>
<br>
never be able to maintain his current lifestyle.<br>
<br>
"…It's fine, you know? I like taking care of you, Amane."<br>
<br>
"I'd let myself go to pieces… without you, I'd fall apart and wither away…"<br>
<br>
"Heh-heh."<br>
<br>
The frightening thing about Mahiru was that Amane knew that if she left, his whole<br>
<br>
life would become an emotional wreck.<br>
<br>
In several senses, he had become something like her prisoner. It would be impossible<br>
<br>
for him to leave her—and he didn't want to. Needless to say, the main reason was<br>
<br>
because he was in love with her.<br>
<br>
If he were to confess his feelings and be rejected, he was sure he would feel like death,<br>
<br>
emotionally and physically. Amane laughed at himself but didn't tell her that was why<br>
<br>
he hadn't been able to move forward.<br>
<br>
Mahiru stepped toward him, inexplicably. She didn't press up against him, but she was<br>
<br>
close enough that they were just lightly touching. She drew close to Amane until she<br>
<br>
was right in front of him and looked up—then with her index finger, she traced the<br>
<br>
outline of his lips.<br>
<br>
"…I'm going to spoil you as much as I like, so just relax and enjoy it, okay?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru narrowed her eyes impishly at Amane. He realized he'd forgotten how to<br>
<br>
breathe.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was wearing a smile he had never seen before. It was sweet, yet provocative…<br>
<br>
even enchanting. It could even be called devilish and was enough to bewitch anyone.<br>
<br>
Amane could feel it tugging at his emotions.<br>
<br>
He could also feel his heart pounding and the blood rushing through his veins.<br>
<br>
Amane had seen many of Mahiru's smiles, from her beautiful angelic one, to a subtle,<br>
<br>
vanishing smirk, to a cherubic grin, but she had never given him such a flirtatious look<br>
<br>
before.<br>
<br>
She gazed with satisfaction at Amane, still frozen in place, then reverted to her usual<br>
<br>
smile as she headed for the kitchen. "Well, I'm going to go make dinner."<br>
<br>
Amane watched her go, cheeks burning.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 45: Before the Test, a Moment<br>
<br>
The Sunday before the start of exams, Amane was studying quietly in his own room.<br>
<br>
He wanted to get high marks, but there was also another reason he was studying—he<br>
<br>
was trying to drive thoughts of Mahiru out of his head.<br>
<br>
"…I'm going to spoil you as much as I like, so just relax and enjoy it, okay?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru had whispered those unbelievable words with a devilish smile, and now<br>
<br>
thoughts of her threatened to fill his head, leaving room for nothing else.<br>
<br>
Amane didn't know whether Mahiru's recent suggestive behavior toward him was<br>
<br>
intentional, but it was certainly effective. He appreciated it, but at the same time, it<br>
<br>
made him nervous.<br>
<br>
Until he was sure of Mahiru's intentions, he couldn't really make a move.<br>
<br>
All sorts of questions troubled him, so to drive them all away, he'd been studying<br>
<br>
furiously since early morning. His efforts were at least somewhat successful, because<br>
<br>
he'd gotten so caught up in the work that by the time he realized, it was past two in<br>
<br>
the afternoon.<br>
<br>
The fact that he had worked straight through without eating lunch was proof of how<br>
<br>
focused he had been, but now that he had noticed the time and checked the clock, his<br>
<br>
stomach immediately growled with hunger.<br>
<br>
"…I guess I should at least eat lunch."<br>
<br>
Amane stretched out to relieve some of the stiffness that had built up after sitting in<br>
<br>
one place for so long. Then he stood up and left his room.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had said she would be home alone studying for exams that day, and she hadn't<br>
<br>
come over to Amane's. That meant Amane would have to fix lunch on his own.<br>
<br>
Thinking about how he'd been spoiled with good food since meeting Mahiru, he<br>
<br>
headed for the kitchen and opened the refrigerator.<br>
<br>
He put a frozen portion of rice that had been set aside for quick use into the<br>
<br>
microwave, and while it was thawing, he took a bowl and scooped out several types of<br>
<br>
the preserved vegetables that Mahiru had prepared ahead of time, guaranteeing some<br>
<br>
color and nutrients for his meal.<br>
<br>
All of this is Mahiru's doing.<br>
<br>
If it had been just Amane, he wouldn't have prepared any vegetables. His lunch<br>
<br>
would've come from the convenience store.<br>
<br>
Now he had a fair amount of food in the house, and he also knew how to make some<br>
<br>
things himself. They weren't on the same level as Mahiru's cooking, which was always<br>
<br>
delicious, lovely to look at, and nutritious to boot. Still, he had learned to make some<br>
<br>
edible dishes.<br>
<br>
Using what he'd learned from Mahiru, Amane made a simple fried rice for lunch with<br>
<br>
just eggs and bacon. But the meal turned out to be plenty colorful thanks to the side<br>
<br>
dishes Mahiru had prepared.<br>
<br>
With the addition of instant Chinese-style soup, it was a perfectly satisfactory menu<br>
<br>
for an easy lunch.<br>
<br>
He loaded it all on a tray and carried it over to the dining table.<br>
<br>
"Let's eat."<br>
<br>
He smiled softly as he looked down at a weekend lunch that he previously would have<br>
<br>
had trouble imagining. Then he pressed his hands together in thanks and picked up<br>
<br>
his spoon.<br>
<br>
The fried rice that he brought to his mouth had a somewhat strong flavor, different<br>
<br>
from Mahiru's, but it wasn't bad. It turned out to be well seasoned for something<br>
<br>
prepared by a high school boy.<br>
<br>
It's really different, huh?<br>
<br>
Amane's eating habits had completely changed, and so had various other things about<br>
<br>
him. In all sorts of ways, he had become completely spoiled.<br>
<br>
He wondered if he was becoming a better person in his daily life. After experiencing<br>
<br>
life with Mahiru, Amane didn't want to return to his previous existence—now that he<br>
<br>
knew life could be this good, he didn't want to go back. He had become really spoiled,<br>
<br>
in the sense that he felt he would never be satisfied if Mahiru left.<br>
<br>
He wasn't only pampered in all practical aspects of life; he was spoiled emotionally as<br>
<br>
well.<br>
<br>
Amane remembered something he had heard before from his father, Shuuto.<br>
<br>
Apparently, the Fujimiya men were the earnestly devoted type. The type who falls in<br>
<br>
love with only one person and then treasures them.<br>
<br>
Amane did not have to think about whether he too had inherited those tendencies.<br>
<br>
Ever since he had become aware that he was in love with Mahiru, he paid even less<br>
<br>
attention to other girls. The most important thing was that he wanted to treasure<br>
<br>
Mahiru and make her happy.<br>
<br>
…I won't settle for anyone but Mahiru. 5<br>
<br>
Whether he was the one to bring her joy or not, as long as Mahiru was happy, he<br>
<br>
decided he would back off right away if she fell for someone else and chose that person<br>
<br>
instead. He told himself that seeing Mahiru smiling joyfully was enough.<br>
<br>
However, he also had contradictory feelings. He really wanted to be the one to make<br>
<br>
her happy, and he definitely didn't want to give her away. He didn't want to be apart<br>
<br>
from Mahiru, and he liked being the only one who really knew her.<br>
<br>
Some people would probably call what he was feeling an obsession—his heart was<br>
<br>
full of emotions that he could not explain to anyone else, like the feeling that he just<br>
<br>
couldn't live without Mahiru.<br>
<br>
She wasn't just a pretty face; she had a pure heart as well. Amane had frankly been<br>
<br>
manipulated by the deep, strong feeling of love that was in his heart.<br>
<br>
"…I wouldn't have so much trouble if I was more assertive."<br>
<br>
Amane laughed a little. The words that he had muttered out loud naturally had a selfdeprecating ring to them.<br>
<br>
For the first time in his sixteen years of life, he was in love with someone, and he<br>
<br>
wanted to be the one by her side, but he had no idea how to make that happen.<br>
<br>
Anyone else would probably have laughed, if they knew that he had made it to sixteen<br>
<br>
without experiencing his first love. 3<br>
<br>
He was aware that he had a craven and cautious nature, and that he didn't know the<br>
<br>
first thing about approaching girls. He believed that these qualities had helped earn<br>
<br>
Mahiru's trust, and that they weren't things that he could change easily. But he had<br>
<br>
always wished that he could be more assertive.<br>
<br>
That was exactly why he was working so hard at his studies and making an effort to<br>
<br>
exercise. He was trying to gain some self-confidence.<br>
<br>
With a quiet, bitter smile, Amane scarfed down the rest of the fried rice.<br>
<br>
Amane took a short break after eating to limber up his stiff muscles with some more<br>
<br>
stretching, and while he was at it, he decided to do some light exercise to relax. He<br>
<br>
changed into running clothes in his room.<br>
<br>
He had been sitting at his desk for a while, so he figured a bit of physical activity would<br>
<br>
be a good change of pace.<br>
<br>
Still, he didn't have that much stamina. He would need to reserve some energy for<br>
<br>
studying more later. He was sure that he would sleep like a log that night.<br>
<br>
Reminding himself to be careful not to overdo it, Amane stepped through the door, and<br>
<br>
happened to meet Mahiru just as she was walking out of her own apartment.<br>
<br>
"Ah, Amane… Going to exercise?"<br>
<br>
She could clearly tell by his outfit. She gave him a charming smile, and he nodded in<br>
<br>
response. Mahiru was dressed like she was going out, so Amane figured he must have<br>
<br>
caught her just as she was leaving.<br>
<br>
For a second, he remembered what had happened the day before and almost groaned<br>
<br>
out loud, but he had calmed down a little since then, so he didn't get flustered from<br>
<br>
just seeing her.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, I need a break," he replied. "You too? Looks like you're going shopping."<br>
<br>
"Yes. Speaking of which, I remember being low on eggs. I thought I'd make rolled<br>
<br>
omelets for dinner tonight. We've got exams tomorrow, and if I leave some for<br>
<br>
breakfast, they might help you do your best…"<br>
<br>
"Seriously? Suddenly I feel a surge of energy!"<br>
<br>
"I'm doing it for my sake, too, you know." Mahiru put a hand over her mouth and<br>
<br>
giggled a little.<br>
<br>
Amane answered, frowning slightly, "I can't help myself; you make the best omelets."<br>
<br>
This brought the conversation to a pause, but both knew that Amane wasn't actually<br>
<br>
upset. Through the gaps in Mahiru's fingers, he could see her smile widen.<br>
<br>
"Ah, that's right, I used the last egg and also some bacon earlier. And I ate one of the<br>
<br>
frozen portions of rice."<br>
<br>
"Oh, you made your own lunch?" Mahiru remarked. "Impressive."<br>
<br>
"…I feel like you're making fun of me. I believe I do cook occasionally even when you're<br>
<br>
over."<br>
<br>
Naturally, Amane felt bad about leaving all the cooking to Mahiru, so he usually tried<br>
<br>
to help her with simple tasks, and on days when Mahiru seemed to be tired or feeling<br>
<br>
down, he would take over and make the meals.<br>
<br>
There were limits to what he could make, so sometimes the menu deviated<br>
<br>
considerably from what they had planned on. Disregarding the presentation and<br>
<br>
accepting that the flavor would be inferior to Mahiru's food, Amane was capable of<br>
<br>
cooking a passable meal.<br>
<br>
So there was no reason for her to praise him like that just because he had made lunch.<br>
<br>
"I know that, but you hardly ever do it when you're home alone, right? You tend to<br>
<br>
choose instant meals when you're by yourself, because cooking is a pain and you're<br>
<br>
fine with something easy."<br>
<br>
"Uh—"<br>
<br>
"Guessing from the ingredients and from your repertoire, I bet you made fried rice or<br>
<br>
something like that. It sounds like you did a good job, so that's great."<br>
<br>
Amane was at a loss for words. She saw right through him. He thought he could feel<br>
<br>
his blood begin to boil.<br>
<br>
Mahiru broke the tension when she laughed out loud and extended a hand toward<br>
<br>
Amane. She gently combed her fingers through his hair, fluffing it up as she hit him<br>
<br>
with a charming smile.<br>
<br>
Amane pursed his lips tightly. He didn't hate the feeling; rather, it made him happy. He<br>
<br>
really had become spoiled.<br>
<br>
"…Knock it off already, geez."<br>
<br>
"Aw, too bad. I wanted to do it more."<br>
<br>
As she said that, Mahiru readily pulled away and smiled gently.<br>
<br>
It occurred to Amane that his serious expression was only making things worse, and<br>
<br>
he turned away from her.<br>
<br>
"…Are eggs the only thing you're buying?"<br>
<br>
He changed the subject so that Mahiru couldn't pet him anymore.<br>
<br>
"Let's see, there are other ingredients I need for dinner, like the eggs… and milk, but<br>
<br>
that should do it, I think. I was planning to make a quick trip, so I figured I'd just go to<br>
<br>
the closest grocery store."<br>
<br>
"Got it. I can pick all that up on my way back home."<br>
<br>
Amane wouldn't have said anything if Mahiru had other errands or shopping to do<br>
<br>
besides for groceries, things he couldn't do in her stead. But if she didn't have anything<br>
<br>
else to go out for, there was no reason for her to spend the extra time and effort.<br>
<br>
Amane was going outside anyway, so it would be better to have her stay home and do<br>
<br>
something else she wanted to do. She spent time every night making him dinner, so he<br>
<br>
figured he should at least do this much.<br>
<br>
"Huh? But then you'll have to carry it all."<br>
<br>
"It's fine, I'll go shopping on my way back. And it's not like the grocery store is that far."<br>
<br>
"Wh-what about money?"<br>
<br>
"I've got my cash card with me. And I've already checked the balance. I can get a receipt<br>
<br>
from the supermarket, so there won't be any problem with splitting the bill or<br>
<br>
anything."<br>
<br>
Amane cocked his head as to ask if there was anything else, and this time, Mahiru<br>
<br>
fumbled over her words.<br>
<br>
"…Sorry to make you do this."<br>
<br>
"I told you, it's fine; I'm going out anyway."<br>
<br>
Amane ruffled Mahiru's hair in retaliation, and she looked at him with narrowed eyes<br>
<br>
as if he was tickling her. Something in her expression looked genuinely happy, and<br>
<br>
Amane was quietly relieved that he hadn't committed some grave mistake.<br>
<br>
"…All right, I'll leave it to you. I'll be waiting at home."<br>
<br>
"Whose home?"<br>
<br>
"I wonder?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru tilted her head slightly to the side, looking bashful. Then without missing a<br>
<br>
beat, she opened the door to Amane's apartment, using the spare key that she had<br>
<br>
been holding already, and slipped in smoothly through the crack.<br>
<br>
Having made her answer obvious, Mahiru peeked back out through the door and<br>
<br>
smiled at Amane.<br>
<br>
"See you when you get back, Amane."<br>
<br>
"…I'm going now," he replied, feeling amused by Mahiru, who no longer seemed to care<br>
<br>
whose apartment was whose. 1<br>
<br>
Mahiru's smile grew wider as she waved good-bye to Amane.<br>
<br>
After warming up with some light stretching, Amane went for an easy jog that lasted<br>
<br>
a little less than an hour, and then made a trip to the supermarket as part of his<br>
<br>
cooldown before returning home.<br>
<br>
Since he was jogging, he was able to relax and exercise without overthinking, and his<br>
<br>
mind quieted a little bit. For now, things seemed to have settled down without him<br>
<br>
having to respond to all of Mahiru's provocations, so he returned home feeling<br>
<br>
relieved. With the quiet shuffling of her house slippers, Mahiru came to greet him at<br>
<br>
the door.<br>
<br>
"Welcome home. I went ahead and filled the bath with hot water. Want to get in?" 2<br>
<br>
She casually took the shopping bags out of his hands, and he found himself gaping at<br>
<br>
her.<br>
<br>
Itsuki and Yuuta had both said that she acted exactly like a newlywed wife, and she<br>
<br>
really did. Mahiru herself probably didn't intend it that way, but her movements were<br>
<br>
brisk and efficient, and somebody who didn't know better might have made that<br>
<br>
assumption. Amane felt strangely embarrassed by the thought.<br>
<br>
"…Amane?"<br>
<br>
"Ah, it's nothing. Thank you, I will go take a bath."<br>
<br>
He smiled vaguely in response to the strange look from Mahiru, rinsed his hands at<br>
<br>
the sink, then headed for his room to get ready for the bath.<br>
<br>
He pulled out his usual loungewear, and then went into the bathroom, where, as<br>
<br>
Mahiru had said, the bathtub was full of piping hot water and set to the perfect<br>
<br>
temperature.<br>
<br>
After saying a silent thanks to Mahiru for being so prepared and generally being there<br>
<br>
for him, he showered off the sweat from his run.<br>
<br>
Amane was self-indulgent and lazy at heart, but that didn't mean he was okay with<br>
<br>
being dirty. He was someone who enjoyed a good bath.<br>
<br>
When he submerged himself in the bathtub after properly washing the filth off his<br>
<br>
body and hair, it felt like all the fatigue in his mind and body melted away. He realized<br>
<br>
that he was pretty worn out as the exhaustion seemed to dissolve in the hot water.<br>
<br>
As he soaked in the bathwater that was just the right temperature, Amane leaned back<br>
<br>
against the side of the tub and exhaled.<br>
<br>
Then he looked down at his body through the clear water—he hadn't added bath salts<br>
<br>
or anything to it—and his exhale turned into a sigh.<br>
<br>
"…Still got a lot of work to do, huh?"<br>
<br>
It hadn't been very long since he'd started really exercising, so it was to be expected.<br>
<br>
Amane had very little muscle on his body because he had never trained and ate<br>
<br>
properly. He was extremely thin, a far cry from his image of masculinity. The words<br>
<br>
bean sprout came immediately to mind.<br>
<br>
Amane wanted to get a little stronger and improve his looks while he was at it. Some<br>
<br>
of his classmates had seen him in his "mystery man" form before, so he couldn't<br>
<br>
heedlessly assume that look without attracting suspicion, but he knew that he could<br>
<br>
be more diligent with his skin care and grooming.<br>
<br>
He admired Mahiru, who was never negligent in her daily self-care. He was sure that<br>
<br>
she must put in a lot of work that he wasn't even aware of.<br>
<br>
As he thought about all these things, Amane felt a considerable drowsiness creep over<br>
<br>
him, probably from the comfortable warmth of the water and his own fatigue. He let<br>
<br>
out another deep sigh as he began dozing off in the tub.<br>
<br>
Eventually, Mahiru, concerned that he was taking too long in the bath, ended up<br>
<br>
waking him in a panic when she opened the bathroom door to check on him.<br>
<br>
"Um, you know… it's dangerous to stay in too long, okay?"<br>
<br>
"I'm really sorry for being so careless."<br>
<br>
All Amane could do was apologize earnestly. He wasn't sure whether Mahiru's flushed<br>
<br>
cheeks were due to anger or embarrassment from glimpsing his top half in the bath—<br>
<br>
he imagined it was at least partially from worry.<br>
<br>
He had heard that people had drowned in as little as thirty centimeters of water, so<br>
<br>
Mahiru's anger seemed justified. Amane imagined that she was all the more anxious<br>
<br>
because she herself couldn't swim.<br>
<br>
He tried to come up with some excuse, but his mind was in a fog.<br>
<br>
He hadn't been completely asleep; really it was more like his consciousness was<br>
<br>
dipping a toe into the ocean of slumber. He was confident that he would have woken<br>
<br>
up without a problem if he had lost his balance and bumped into the side of the tub.<br>
<br>
"…Why are you pushing yourself so hard?"<br>
<br>
Amane felt instantly remorseful when he heard the suspicion in Mahiru's words. He<br>
<br>
could tell that he'd messed up when he heard the anxiety in her voice, which made it<br>
<br>
clear that he'd given her cause for stress.<br>
<br>
"I won't deny the value of hard work," Mahiru continued, "but if you can't handle it all,<br>
<br>
shouldn't you ease up a little?"<br>
<br>
"You're right, of course. I'll be more careful next time."<br>
<br>
"But why are you doing all this, Amane?" she asked again.<br>
<br>
"…I guess… because I want to become someone I can be proud of."<br>
<br>
Even though she sounded a little angry, Mahiru looked mostly sad. Amane smiled<br>
<br>
meekly and stroked her head to try to wipe away the anxious look in her eyes, while<br>
<br>
vowing not to make such a mistake again.<br>
<br>
"I've been thinking I wanna be more confident in myself, is all. And I wanted to start<br>
<br>
with things like my studies and exercise. I didn't mean to worry you; this was really all<br>
<br>
my fault. Next time, I'll keep in mind how much I can handle."<br>
<br>
"…Are you in that big of a hurry?"<br>
<br>
"I guess there's probably no rush, but I want to work harder… To make myself into<br>
<br>
someone I can be confident in. After all, I'm working hard for my own sake," Amane<br>
<br>
told her with a smile as he rubbed her head.<br>
<br>
Mahiru stared hard into Amane's eyes, then sighed. "…I understand your determination.<br>
<br>
That said, I'm serious: If you don't take better care of yourself, I'm going to get really<br>
<br>
worried, okay?"<br>
<br>
"I said I was sorry."<br>
<br>
"But I think you really shine when you try so hard, and I don't want to get in the way<br>
<br>
of your progress. I've been watching you but trying not to get in your way."<br>
<br>
"If anything, you're the one keeping me going," he insisted. "Taking care of meals is<br>
<br>
really a huge help. I can't manage that as well as you can, after all."<br>
<br>
"You're the one putting in all the effort, so it would be more accurate to say that it's all<br>
<br>
I can do to help… Do your best, but don't push yourself too hard, okay?"<br>
<br>
"I'll try not to make you worry again."<br>
<br>
No doubt, he would be careful not to fall asleep in the bath again. He had no desire to<br>
<br>
learn what drowning felt like.<br>
<br>
Amane also didn't want to make Mahiru fret and cry, so he decided to take better care<br>
<br>
of his physical health and not overexert himself.<br>
<br>
Mahiru still looked a little skeptical, so he continued to try to reassure her by gently<br>
<br>
stroking her hair.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 46: After the Test, a Moment<br>
<br>
Two days passed, and the tests were over. Amane felt liberated.<br>
<br>
He surprisingly spent less time sitting at his desk during exams than when regular<br>
<br>
classes were in session, and he found that test prep was easier than his usual studies.<br>
<br>
Though this time around, there had been additional pressure, because he was more<br>
<br>
invested in the outcome.<br>
<br>
Typically, Amane put in a reasonable amount of effort and always got a decent score.<br>
<br>
However, this time, he'd spent extra time studying and really focused on acing his<br>
<br>
exams. He'd been a bit nervous going into the tests, but now that they were over, he<br>
<br>
felt satisfied with his performance.<br>
<br>
He had gotten together with Mahiru to compare their answers from the previous day's<br>
<br>
tests, and although he hadn't gotten a perfect score, it seemed like he had gotten a very<br>
<br>
good one. They would probably go over today's questions in detail once they got home,<br>
<br>
and Amane was confident that he had answered better this time around.<br>
<br>
Amane leaned back against his chair and let his body relax as he took a break. Chitose<br>
<br>
staggered over, looking like she had been drained of all vitality.<br>
<br>
"Amaneee, how'd it go?"<br>
<br>
Her expression lacked its usual luster. Amane knew that Chitose was not a big fan of<br>
<br>
studying. She was a quick learner but not the kind of person to put in the work, and in<br>
<br>
this case, she didn't prepare enough.<br>
<br>
"There wasn't anything specific that gave me trouble, so I think I did well," he<br>
<br>
answered.<br>
<br>
"Wow, you were really serious about it this time. You gonna ask me how I did?"<br>
<br>
"Let me guess, you did terribly but somehow avoided failing?"<br>
<br>
"You got it."<br>
<br>
"After all that tutoring, it'd be a shame if you still failed."<br>
<br>
Compared to Itsuki and Chitose, and even Yuuta, Mahiru and Amane were far enough<br>
<br>
ahead in their studies that they had time to help Chitose so she could pass the tests.<br>
<br>
Chitose's cheekiness and her attitude toward school often got in the way of her<br>
<br>
studies, but fundamentally, she had a good head on her shoulders and wasn't bad at<br>
<br>
understanding the material—so as long as it was taught well, she would grasp it<br>
<br>
quickly.<br>
<br>
As for whether she would retain the information after the tests, that depended on<br>
<br>
whether she ever bothered to review it.<br>
<br>
"It's fine, it's fine! I did better than ever before!" she said triumphantly.<br>
<br>
"Glad to hear it. Not that the bar was all that high, but… as long as you're happy, I'm<br>
<br>
happy. Just remember to work hard at the end of the semester, too."<br>
<br>
"Whaa—? We just finished these tests; don't talk about the next ones… that's<br>
<br>
depressing… Right now, I want to celebrate our freedom! Right, Itsuki?"<br>
<br>
"That's right! We shouldn't spend the present dwelling on the past or thinking about<br>
<br>
some far-off future."<br>
<br>
Itsuki, slumped listlessly in his chair behind Amane, groaned and agreed with what<br>
<br>
Chitose had said. Itsuki had obviously studied more seriously than Chitose, but the<br>
<br>
English exam had practically done him in, and he had no energy left.<br>
<br>
"I want to compare my test answers with someone, though," Amane said.<br>
<br>
"No way! Don't make us think about the tests anymore!"<br>
<br>
Itsuki and Chitose clung to each other, looking absolutely exhausted, commiserating<br>
<br>
over their trials and tribulations.<br>
<br>
"You seem lively enough to me," Amane grumbled, and shifted his gaze to the throng<br>
<br>
of people in the classroom who had finished their exams.<br>
<br>
They were gathering one after another around Mahiru, probably to compare answers<br>
<br>
with her.<br>
<br>
They wanted to see Mahiru's answers, since she had gotten nearly perfect scores on<br>
<br>
previous tests. With a humble smile, Mahiru pulled out her various answer sheets.<br>
<br>
Amane had no desire to join the fray, so he would compare answers with her at home.<br>
<br>
"…Must be tough."<br>
<br>
He didn't call Mahiru by name, but it must have been clear who he meant.<br>
<br>
Itsuki and Chitose both looked over at Mahiru and grinned.<br>
<br>
"Well, the angel is cute, and clever, and popular, so she's in great demand."<br>
<br>
"You could get in there too and help her out?"<br>
<br>
"I don't see any need for that," he scoffed.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, guess you're right."<br>
<br>
"Plus, you'll be there when she gets home"—Itsuki didn't say that part out loud, but<br>
<br>
Amane knew the logical conclusion of that train of thought. He was grateful to his<br>
<br>
friend for not voicing it, but Itsuki's grinning face, which basically said he knew all<br>
<br>
about it, was more than enough to make Amane irritable.<br>
<br>
Itsuki laughed again at Amane's scowl, and the lines in Amane's forehead grew deeper.<br>
<br>
Then he heard another voice laughing with amusement, and he relaxed his grimace<br>
<br>
just a little.<br>
<br>
"Itsuki, if you tease him too much, Fujimiya will pout," Yuuta remarked.<br>
<br>
"He's fine, he's fine, Amane won't get mad at me just for that."<br>
<br>
"It looked like the vein in his temple was going to pop just now, though."<br>
<br>
"Uh-oh, I think you're right."<br>
<br>
Yuuta surprised Amane by stepping in to arbitrate. He shrugged and decided not to<br>
<br>
smack Itsuki after all.<br>
<br>
"Fujimiya, how were your grades? Must be good, looking at your face."<br>
<br>
"Well, I think I did fairly well," Amane nodded. "How about you?"<br>
<br>
"Thanks to your help, I feel like I scored more points than usual," Yuuta said. "Though<br>
<br>
I won't know until I compare answers with someone later."<br>
<br>
"I see; that's good to hear."<br>
<br>
Amane had been worried about everyone's results, since their Saturday study session<br>
<br>
had turned into a video game tournament halfway through, but based on the<br>
<br>
impression he was getting from Yuuta, it had worked out okay.<br>
<br>
Amane's expression softened a little as he thought back on that day and mused that it<br>
<br>
might be nice to get together and study like that sometimes. Itsuki's face then showed<br>
<br>
a clear look of discontent.<br>
<br>
"Hey, you're letting Yuuta off awfully easy, aren't you, Amane?"<br>
<br>
"Don't worry about him; reflect on your own bad habits."<br>
<br>
"I believe that I am loved, even when you say such things."<br>
<br>
"Don't get creepy. I—"<br>
<br>
"That's right, there's only one person in this world who Amane loves."<br>
<br>
Even though he muttered it under his breath, Itsuki had still crossed a line. Amane<br>
<br>
grabbed his friend in a solid headlock.<br>
<br>
Yuuta laughed and made no attempt to interfere, as though he knew that Itsuki<br>
<br>
deserved it.<br>
<br>
Chitose also seemed amused. "Itsuki, you're a real dummy." She smirked.<br>
<br>
Itsuki, who was getting a knuckle forcibly ground into his forehead, had a foolish smile<br>
<br>
on his face, as if it didn't hurt at all.<br>
<br>
Amane wasn't putting any real strength behind the attack, so it shouldn't have hurt<br>
<br>
that much, but he couldn't help but feel a little annoyed at how calm Itsuki was acting.<br>
<br>
"Well, you're definitely devoted, Fujimiya. That's easy to see."<br>
<br>
"Not you too, Kadowaki…"<br>
<br>
"Hey, I didn't say what you're devoted to, just that you're devoted!" Yuuta beamed.<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't think of anything to say, so he just turned away.<br>
<br>
His behavior must have been amusing, because Itsuki, Chitose, and Yuuta all laughed<br>
<br>
like something was hilarious. Amane stared in the opposite direction, biting his lip and<br>
<br>
feeling extremely embarrassed.<br>
<br>
Mahiru must have gotten free just at that moment. She locked eyes with him and<br>
<br>
smiled.<br>
<br>
Amane groaned, feeling even more embarrassed now that Mahiru had looked at him,<br>
<br>
but she calmly walked over, wearing a smile on her face.<br>
<br>
"Looks like you're having fun over here," she said. "What were you talking about?"<br>
<br>
"Hmm? We were talking about how cute Amane is!"<br>
<br>
"Watch it, Chitose—"<br>
<br>
"That is what we were talking about, right?"<br>
<br>
"Basically, they were all teasing me."<br>
<br>
"Oh yeah, that too."<br>
<br>
"See?! She admits it."<br>
<br>
Amane shot Chitose a pointed look to tell her to cut it out, but Chitose seemed totally<br>
<br>
indifferent. Instead, he glared at Itsuki, who was supposed to be in charge of<br>
<br>
controlling her.<br>
<br>
"Why are you glaring at me?"<br>
<br>
"Maybe because you're the one who started all this in the first place?"<br>
<br>
"So… what were you talking about, then?" Mahiru asked again.<br>
<br>
"Oh, just the fact that Amane's a pure, innocent, devoted boy…," Chitose murmured.<br>
<br>
Amane really wished she would shut up already.<br>
<br>
"I don't know what all this nonsense about being 'pure' or whatever is." He scowled.<br>
<br>
"What do you even mean, anyway? What's so pure about me?"<br>
<br>
Itsuki put on a dramatic expression of exaggerated surprise. "Oh, don't tell me you<br>
<br>
weren't aware…?"<br>
<br>
Amane kicked his friend under the desk and glanced over at Mahiru. She was looking<br>
<br>
upward slightly, with her usual smile on, as if she was pondering something.<br>
<br>
"Actually, we were talking about how Fujimiya is rather stoic. I guess calling him<br>
<br>
straightforward would be more accurate," Yuuta added.<br>
<br>
"I see." Mahiru nodded. "Fujimiya is definitely the type to work hard once he sets his<br>
<br>
mind to something. In that sense, he's a very straightforward person, isn't he? I think<br>
<br>
that's a wonderful quality to have."<br>
<br>
"It really is. I just wish that he would have some more confidence about it."<br>
<br>
"That's very true," she agreed.<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't stand being there a second longer listening to the two of them mock<br>
<br>
him with their excessive praise.<br>
<br>
He made eye contact with Mahiru, who gave him a gentle smile.<br>
<br>
He felt embarrassed and immediately averted his eyes and saw that the rest of their<br>
<br>
classmates were looking over enviously.<br>
<br>
Their attention was not focused on him, but on Mahiru and Yuuta, who somehow<br>
<br>
seemed to be hitting it off talking about Amane. That was a relief, but it brought up<br>
<br>
some slightly complicated feelings.<br>
<br>
Seeing the two most popular people chattering away and getting along with each other<br>
<br>
would naturally attract attention. Amane felt a slight tinge of jealousy himself at the<br>
<br>
fact that neither of the two seemed to be the least bit bothered by everyone looking at<br>
<br>
them.<br>
<br>
"What's wrong, Amane?" Chitose asked. "You're blushing…"<br>
<br>
"I am not."<br>
<br>
"You are too! And you're trying to hide it. Oh, Mahiru? After school, let's go have fun<br>
<br>
somewhere, all five of us. We're all together already, and the tests are over, so let's<br>
<br>
party!"<br>
<br>
Completely ignoring Amane's uncooperative attitude, Chitose pivoted to Mahiru with<br>
<br>
a suggestion. It was a casual invitation, without too much pressure, but with her usual<br>
<br>
angelic smile still on her face, Mahiru answered, "Of course, if everyone wants to."<br>
<br>
"The five of us" must have included Amane, too, but he probably didn't have the right<br>
<br>
to veto the plan, and Chitose must have understood that he wasn't likely to reject it<br>
<br>
anyway.<br>
<br>
Chitose was wearing an expression that said, "I got you!"<br>
<br>
Amane looked away again as he nodded his assent.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 47: A Reward from the Angel<br>
<br>
"Hey, Amane, don't you think you tried too hard this time?" Itsuki grumbled, sounding<br>
<br>
somewhat astonished as he stared at the exam rankings that had been posted on the<br>
<br>
bulletin board in the hallway.<br>
<br>
Even after their group study session, Amane had continued working diligently,<br>
<br>
preparing for the exams. He'd wanted to be proud of himself for a change. Also, the<br>
<br>
studying had helped distract him from certain coquettish words that had been<br>
<br>
whispered in his ear.<br>
<br>
They were looking at the result of his efforts—and all the work he'd done to keep his<br>
<br>
mind off her suggestive expressions and the words that she had uttered—which had<br>
<br>
led him to rank sixth in their grade this time.<br>
<br>
"Wow, it's hard to believe I made it that far."<br>
<br>
"You really worked for it. Proud of yourself?"<br>
<br>
"…Pretty proud, I guess. But there's no guarantee that I'll be able to do it again."<br>
<br>
"What a stoic guy…"<br>
<br>
He didn't want Mahiru to see him climb so high only to fall back down out of<br>
<br>
negligence. There would be no point to it unless he could consistently place in the<br>
<br>
upper ranks.<br>
<br>
Considering that college entrance exams were also coming up, it would be absurd to<br>
<br>
be satisfied with this one success and give up trying.<br>
<br>
Hasty preparations would not be enough for the entrance exams since students from<br>
<br>
other schools would also be vying for spots, so Amane vowed to keep studying hard<br>
<br>
so that he would be ready for what was to come as well.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, Mahiru had placed far ahead of anyone else, in the top spot again. This<br>
<br>
was nothing if not expected, but Amane knew that it was because of how hard she<br>
<br>
worked, and that she never took it for granted.<br>
<br>
"It looks like you took sixth place this time, Fujimiya."<br>
<br>
Mahiru, who had arrived to look at the bulletin board after Amane and Itsuki, smiled<br>
<br>
beautifully as she noticed Amane's name.<br>
<br>
She was in angel mode, and Amane smiled casually back at her, trying not to let any of<br>
<br>
his inner turmoil show on his face.<br>
<br>
He felt the prickle of people's eyes on him, but he was already getting used to talking<br>
<br>
with Mahiru in public. The stares still made him uncomfortable, but he was able to<br>
<br>
soldier through without too much distress.<br>
<br>
"Looks that way." Amane nodded. "Good for me, I guess."<br>
<br>
"Heh-heh, he really worked hard, ya know," Itsuki interjected. "Studying during breaks<br>
<br>
and everything."<br>
<br>
"…Ah, well—"<br>
<br>
"If you worked that hard, shouldn't you give yourself a reward?" Mahiru asked.<br>
<br>
"I… guess so."<br>
<br>
Recalling the reward that Mahiru had promised him caused Amane to experience an<br>
<br>
indescribable surge of emotion.<br>
<br>
She had promised to let him lie in her lap and to clean his ears. He had done so much<br>
<br>
to erase the thought from his mind that he had genuinely forgotten about it, but she'd<br>
<br>
said she would do it if he made it into the top ten.<br>
<br>
He could always decline, but… there was no way he could bring himself to reject such<br>
<br>
an opportunity, if the girl he liked wanted to pamper him like that.<br>
<br>
"…Speaking of which, congratulations on the top spot. Shouldn't you be the one<br>
<br>
treating yourself?"<br>
<br>
"I suppose so. But it's not good to pamper oneself too much."<br>
<br>
"But you're already so strict with yourself that I think you could stand to be a little<br>
<br>
indulgent. Well, that's not for me to say, though."<br>
<br>
Now that they were on the subject, Amane realized that he would be receiving<br>
<br>
something special from Mahiru, but he had nothing to give back, and he wondered<br>
<br>
what he should do.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, he had no idea what he could offer her, so he would have to ask<br>
<br>
about it after they got home.<br>
<br>
Looking at Mahiru wearing her angelic smile, Itsuki quietly whispered to Amane,<br>
<br>
"How about you reward her?"<br>
<br>
Amane didn't need to be told twice, and he made a mental note to ask her about it<br>
<br>
when they got home.<br>
<br>
"Huh? A reward for me?"<br>
<br>
When Amane posed the question to Mahiru as she was preparing dinner at home with<br>
<br>
her apron on, she turned around with a puzzled expression on her face.<br>
<br>
Amane hadn't been able to settle down, remembering the devilish smile she'd put on<br>
<br>
the other day and thinking about the reward that was probably waiting for him after<br>
<br>
dinner. But Mahiru hadn't seemed to notice, and now her expression showed that his<br>
<br>
question was entirely unexpected.<br>
<br>
"There's not really anything specific that I want, but…"<br>
<br>
"Or something you want me to do…?"<br>
<br>
"You do for me? Hmm, let me think. I guess I'd like you to cut that cucumber thinly<br>
<br>
with the slicer."<br>
<br>
"That's not what I mean… Well, if there isn't anything, you don't have to force yourself<br>
<br>
to answer, you know."<br>
<br>
Amane had a feeling she wasn't taking his question seriously, but he didn't want to<br>
<br>
push too hard, so he backed down easily.<br>
<br>
If Mahiru really didn't need anything, that was fine, but if there was something she'd<br>
<br>
like him to do, and it was within Amane's capabilities, he intended to grant her<br>
<br>
request.<br>
<br>
For the time being, she'd said she wanted him to feed the cucumber into the slicer, so<br>
<br>
he washed his hands and cut it thinly, but this was just helping her out rather than a<br>
<br>
reward.<br>
<br>
"Rub some salt on that and set it aside."<br>
<br>
"Yes, ma'am… Is there really nothing more?"<br>
<br>
"Not really. I'm content with how things are at the moment… And anyway, I think that<br>
<br>
I'll be able to fulfill my one wish by myself."<br>
<br>
"The wish you really want granted?"<br>
<br>
"What do you think that is?"<br>
<br>
Amane looked up from the slicer and saw Mahiru smiling gently.<br>
<br>
For a second, her expression looked like the devilish grin she had worn the other day,<br>
<br>
and he couldn't bear to look directly at her, so he dropped his eyes back down to the<br>
<br>
countertop.<br>
<br>
"…I d-don't know."<br>
<br>
"Exactly. So don't worry about it. I'm happy as is." 1<br>
<br>
Amane could sense the smile in her voice.<br>
<br>
Mahiru went back to cooking, giving off an air like she wasn't going to let Amane<br>
<br>
investigate any further. Amane didn't know what to do, so he just kept on thinly slicing<br>
<br>
the cucumber.<br>
<br>
"All right, lie down, Amane."<br>
<br>
After dinner was over, the dreaded reward time arrived.<br>
<br>
As if it was the most natural thing in the world, Mahiru sat down on one side of the<br>
<br>
sofa and smiled at him as she patted her knees. Amane was at a loss for words.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's outfit for the day was shorts with black tights, so he would technically be<br>
<br>
lying in her clothed lap, but only an incredibly thin layer of fabric separated him from<br>
<br>
her skin.<br>
<br>
To make matters worse, she had taken a bath after getting home today, and her whole<br>
<br>
body smelled wonderful.<br>
<br>
It would be suicide for Amane to lie in her lap in such a risky situation.<br>
<br>
"…No, um—"<br>
<br>
"You don't have to if you don't want to, but isn't this what you asked for?"<br>
<br>
"I-it is what I wished for, but the thing is, now that it's actually happening, I'm nervous,<br>
<br>
like… i-it's embarrassing, you know?"<br>
<br>
"Well then, why did you ask for it?"<br>
<br>
"Th-that must have been male instincts or something."<br>
<br>
"Well, you can follow those male instincts, it's fine, but… this is your reward for 1<br>
<br>
working so hard. You don't need to be shy, okay? I'm going to spoil you a lot."<br>
<br>
Mahiru patted her lap again, and Amane gulped.<br>
<br>
It had gotten quite warm lately, so her tights were thinner than before.<br>
<br>
He could just barely see the color of her skin through the sheer material, and it stirred<br>
<br>
up some strong emotions.<br>
<br>
Even if her thighs were covered by the tights, the smooth beauty of her slender legs<br>
<br>
was on display, luring Amane in.<br>
<br>
It probably wasn't Mahiru's intention at all, but the way she was dressed that day was<br>
<br>
going to be the death of him.<br>
<br>
Rightfully, he should have somehow found a way to decline her offer and devise a<br>
<br>
peaceful way out for his heart and soul, but under the pretext of a reward, Amane's<br>
<br>
"male instincts" had gotten him into this mess.<br>
<br>
Gingerly, he sat down beside Mahiru and lowered his head onto her lap.<br>
<br>
He had experienced this once before, and just as he remembered, her legs were very<br>
<br>
soft. Since the fabric separating him from her was even thinner than it had been last<br>
<br>
time, the texture and warmth of her skin came through clearly, and Amane felt his<br>
<br>
heart squeeze tightly.<br>
<br>
He wasn't sure where to look, so he faced upward for the time being and saw Mahiru<br>
<br>
smiling down at him.<br>
<br>
His view of her face, however, was partially obscured by something… or, rather, two 6<br>
<br>
somethings. It was only May, but the temperature had been rising, and the shirt that<br>
<br>
Mahiru was wearing was also quite thin. On top of that, the material followed the lines<br>
<br>
of her body closely, highlighting her shapely figure beneath the fine cloth.<br>
<br>
Amane had to turn over. If he stayed like that, he was going to explode from shame.<br>
<br>
"All right, I'm going to clean your ears now."<br>
<br>
Completely unaware of Amane's inner distress, Mahiru announced this with a smile.<br>
<br>
She sounded somewhat excited. Mahiru reached for the ear pick and tissues that were<br>
<br>
sitting on the table, and something soft pressed down on the side of his head. 3<br>
<br>
(?!)<br>
<br>
Sirens blared in Amane's mind, but Mahiru didn't seem to notice. She quickly grabbed<br>
<br>
the ear pick and sat back up. Amane's heart was pounding as he felt the weight of her<br>
<br>
soft body. Mentally, he was no longer prepared to handle an ear cleaning.<br>
<br>
"Now, hold still," Mahiru whispered in a soothing voice, and she gently fixed his head<br>
<br>
in place with one hand.<br>
<br>
She reminded him not to move while she was cleaning his ears, but Amane found it<br>
<br>
very difficult to stay still, for several reasons.<br>
<br>
Even so, there was no way that he was going to struggle against her, so he stayed<br>
<br>
obediently still and stared hard at the side of the table as something rigid was slowly<br>
<br>
inserted into his ear hole.<br>
<br>
He got chills for a moment. He was more sensitive where his skin was thinner. Amane<br>
<br>
never felt ticklish when he cleaned his own ears, but when Mahiru was doing it, he got<br>
<br>
a strange feeling, probably because he wasn't in control… and because it was exciting<br>
<br>
to know that it was the girl he loved who was doing it.<br>
<br>
He knew that Mahiru was going to do a careful job because of her personality, but<br>
<br>
somehow having her oh-so-gently clean out his ear was kind of ticklish.<br>
<br>
It was a little too tingly to really be pleasant, but at the same time, it had an unusual<br>
<br>
appeal that ignited certain desires.<br>
<br>
At the very least, there was an indescribable niceness to it, pleasant enough that he<br>
<br>
was not going to resist having his ears cleaned like this.<br>
<br>
"It doesn't hurt, does it?" Mahiru asked.<br>
<br>
"Mm… it doesn't hurt. It feels good."<br>
<br>
"Oh really? I'm glad. I've heard that this is supposed to be romantic for guys, but… well,<br>
<br>
does this feel romantic for you?"<br>
<br>
"…A little, I guess."<br>
<br>
"Well, you are a guy, after all."<br>
<br>
"Have I given you any reason to doubt it?"<br>
<br>
If Amane wasn't a guy, he wouldn't be writhing in agony on the inside, and he wouldn't<br>
<br>
be so excited by the softness of her skin. As it was, he couldn't help getting flustered<br>
<br>
being held close and pampered by the person he loved.<br>
<br>
"Heh-heh, it's because you're such a gentleman, Amane. I didn't think you had much<br>
<br>
interest."<br>
<br>
"On the assumption that I am a gentleman, what I want and what I do are very<br>
<br>
different. You ought to be careful; there are men who will smile to your face, then<br>
<br>
attack you when you're alone."<br>
<br>
"By that logic, you wouldn't really be a man then, would you?"<br>
<br>
Amane felt like he had just been called out and bit his lip unhappily. That said, it didn't<br>
<br>
seem like Mahiru had meant it as an insult. She continued peacefully with her cleaning.<br>
<br>
"Here, Amane, turn over. I want to do the other side."<br>
<br>
Even as he frowned harder, Amane turned and presented the opposite ear. Facing her<br>
<br>
belly, however, was a new kind of penance. If he looked down, he would see her shorts,<br>
<br>
and that wouldn't be good, so he had no option but to stare docilely at her stomach.<br>
<br>
Amane wasn't sure if this was heaven or hell.<br>
<br>
It would probably be heavenly if he could be honest about his desires, but as long as<br>
<br>
he was stuck between what he wanted and what he knew was right, it was like he was<br>
<br>
plunging one foot right into hell.<br>
<br>
"…Amane, you've been kind of trembling since we started, but…"<br>
<br>
"Please don't pay any attention to that."<br>
<br>
There was no way he could even begin to tell her what he was feeling inside. After all,<br>
<br>
if he said any of it out loud, Mahiru would definitely pull away from him.<br>
<br>
So there was nothing to be done but obediently accept the ear cleaning and hide his<br>
<br>
desires at all costs. This angel, pampering him innocently with no ulterior motives,<br>
<br>
was a frightening creature.<br>
<br>
Mahiru seemed to have some questions about Amane's behavior, but he was facing her<br>
<br>
and couldn't make eye contact, so she gave up on investigating further and went back<br>
<br>
to cleaning his ear.<br>
<br>
Feeling an inexpressible pleasantness and a ticklish sensation, Amane closed his eyes<br>
<br>
and waited for it to be over.<br>
<br>
Whenever he opened his eyes, he felt slightly guilty about what was happening, so he<br>
<br>
kept them shut. But without his vision, his other senses seemed to become more acute.<br>
<br>
He inhaled her sweet smell, as well as the scents of her shampoo and body wash, and<br>
<br>
he felt the softness of her thighs. He was beside himself. 1<br>
<br>
He couldn't stop thinking about how amazing it would be if he could have his fill of<br>
<br>
these sensations without holding back.<br>
<br>
"Amane, when I'm done with your ears, can I play with your hair?"<br>
<br>
"…If you want."<br>
<br>
If he escaped soon, he wouldn't have to experience this conflict any longer. However,<br>
<br>
Amane was still a guy, and if a girl was going to let him continue lying in her lap, he<br>
<br>
wasn't going to argue. Even as he felt conflicted over wanting her to stop and wanting<br>
<br>
her to do more, in the end, he gave in to his desires. It made him realize that in many<br>
<br>
ways, he was very weak willed.<br>
<br>
Mahiru gave every indication of being pleased by Amane's consent.<br>
<br>
"I'm almost finished, okay?" she said as she carefully scraped out his ear.<br>
<br>
Ah, over already? Amane thought, feeling just a little bit disappointed, suffering lonely<br>
<br>
agony yet again.<br>
<br>
But he didn't let it show on his face or in his movements.<br>
<br>
The slightly ticklish yet pleasant feeling came to an end as Mahiru pulled out the ear<br>
<br>
cleaning tool.<br>
<br>
In its place came a different lovely sensation as Mahiru's fingers slipped smoothly<br>
<br>
through his hair.<br>
<br>
"All right, all done."<br>
<br>
Mahiru combed through his hair with gentle hands as if she was comforting a child,<br>
<br>
and Amane simultaneously felt embarrassed and like he wanted to surrender himself<br>
<br>
to her entirely.<br>
<br>
He knew that if it came down to it, the latter feeling was stronger, and a silent groan<br>
<br>
threatened to escape his lips.<br>
<br>
Mahiru's intention had been to pamper him thoroughly as a reward, and he was<br>
<br>
definitely getting spoiled.<br>
<br>
Part of him wanted to fight against Mahiru, who seemed to be enjoying her chance to<br>
<br>
indulge Amane just as she had promised. Though it felt so good that any willpower he<br>
<br>
had was uprooted entirely, leaving him utterly helpless to resist.<br>
<br>
…I'm getting spoiled…<br>
<br>
He was getting his head caressed by her tender hands while fully savoring her<br>
<br>
feminine scent and warmth. It didn't sound like such a big deal when he put it into<br>
<br>
words, but it felt incredibly good and left him practically euphoric. Amane could<br>
<br>
imagine losing himself if he were allowed to enjoy these kinds of pleasures every day.<br>
<br>
The thought had a certain appeal to it.<br>
<br>
When Amane let out a sigh and relaxed his muscles, he heard a quiet giggle.<br>
<br>
"You're like a pampered little boy, for once," Mahiru softly teased.<br>
<br>
"…Whose fault is that?"<br>
<br>
"My fault." Mahiru giggled sweetly and swept her fingers through his hair again. "I<br>
<br>
always want to dote on you, because I want an excuse to touch you. Your hair feels so<br>
<br>
nice to brush."<br>
<br>
"…Really?"<br>
<br>
"Yes. It's smooth and glossy. How do you get your hair to do that…?"<br>
<br>
"…I just use the shampoo my mom recommended."<br>
<br>
Shihoko had been very insistent about making sure he didn't neglect and damage his<br>
<br>
fine hair. Subsequently, Amane used shampoo and conditioner found in beauty salons,<br>
<br>
the kind that boasted about being good for your lustrous locks. He didn't hate the scent<br>
<br>
of it, and he liked the feeling when he ran his fingers through his hair after it dried, so<br>
<br>
he kept using the product.<br>
<br>
"You should talk, your hair is super smooth, Mahiru."<br>
<br>
He gathered a tuft of the flaxen strands into his hand, and it felt even softer and<br>
<br>
smoother than his.<br>
<br>
Of course, the girl had silkier, glossier hair; Amane's couldn't compete. Mahiru's had a<br>
<br>
texture that made him want to touch it forever, and it had a clean, soapy scent that<br>
<br>
wasn't overly strong. It was irresistible.<br>
<br>
"I think this every time I pat your head, but you must take a lot of care in looking after<br>
<br>
your hair."<br>
<br>
"…Well, I've never been negligent about it."<br>
<br>
"I can tell. By the way, I've been touching your head whenever I like, but… is that all<br>
<br>
right? They say that a woman's hair is her life, and all that."<br>
<br>
"…I like it when you touch me, Amane." 5<br>
<br>
Amane was glad that she couldn't see his face, because he was sure his expression<br>
<br>
contorted into something strange when Mahiru said those words.<br>
<br>
Shame, delight, confusion, panic… If Mahiru had seen all those strong emotions<br>
<br>
written on his face, she probably would have started to distrust him. 3<br>
<br>
I get carried away because she says things like that.<br>
<br>
Unable to say anything out loud, Amane tried to return to his normal expression. He<br>
<br>
closed his eyes and sighed.<br>
<br>
When he opened his eyes, Mahiru's shirt was right in front of him. 2<br>
<br>
Apparently, he had fallen asleep again—his consciousness had drifted away on a<br>
<br>
cushion of comfort and joy. Though he had no idea how long he'd slept, and that made<br>
<br>
him anxious.<br>
<br>
The hand combing his hair had stopped.<br>
<br>
He sat up timidly and saw that Mahiru was leaning back against the sofa, breathing<br>
<br>
heavily in her sleep.<br>
<br>
"Defenseless," Amane mumbled at Mahiru, whose gentle breaths were rhythmically<br>
<br>
rising and falling, then checked the clock and felt his cheek twitch.<br>
<br>
It was an hour before midnight. He had been lying in Mahiru's lap since nine, after they<br>
<br>
had finished cleaning up dinner and doing other household chores. Which meant that<br>
<br>
he had been in the same position for almost two hours straight.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had probably fallen asleep after being stuck on the couch for so long. Amane<br>
<br>
knew that she wouldn't have been able to bring herself to move and disturb him, so<br>
<br>
she had just nodded off where she sat.<br>
<br>
He thought she ought to be more vigilant, since she was in a guy's apartment, but he<br>
<br>
was the one who'd fallen asleep in her lap in the first place, so he bore some<br>
<br>
responsibility.<br>
<br>
He gazed at Mahiru's sleeping face, wondering what he should do, and decided for the<br>
<br>
time being to go ahead and take a bath.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had already taken hers for the evening, but Amane hadn't taken his yet. Even<br>
<br>
if he was going to wake her up, it was better to let her sleep for now and get his bath<br>
<br>
out of the way. There was also the possibility that Mahiru would wake up on her own<br>
<br>
while he was bathing.<br>
<br>
With that decided, Amane hurriedly went back to his room to get a change of clothes.<br>
<br>
Once Amane finished his bath, he checked the living room and sighed softly.<br>
<br>
As before, Mahiru was completely submerged in the depths of sleep and hadn't stirred,<br>
<br>
even with the noise from the hair dryer.<br>
<br>
"Mahiru, wake up," Amane said, and gently shook her the shoulder. She was still fast<br>
<br>
asleep. Her head slumped to the side, showing she was truly unconscious, so for the<br>
<br>
time being, Amane propped her back up.<br>
<br>
He figured it must have been tiring, sitting there with his head in her lap for so long,<br>
<br>
and she had probably nodded off. For now, it was clear that she wouldn't wake up any<br>
<br>
time soon.<br>
<br>
I feel like this happened last time, too…<br>
<br>
It must have been around the end of last year. He remembered lending Mahiru his own<br>
<br>
bed after she inadvertently fell asleep.<br>
<br>
Amane had a feeling they were headed down the same path this time as well.<br>
<br>
He shook her again, more forcefully, and called her name, but she didn't wake up.<br>
<br>
He heard a quiet, little groan, but it was more like a snore than words.<br>
<br>
This wasn't the first time that Amane had seen Mahiru asleep and defenseless, and he<br>
<br>
couldn't help but wonder, again, whether it was all right for her to have this much faith<br>
<br>
in him.<br>
<br>
Cursing his luck, Amane poked Mahiru's cheek, but she didn't stir. He was only met<br>
<br>
with the feeling of her smooth and soft skin. His thumb traced a path down her cheek,<br>
<br>
stroking it gently.<br>
<br>
When he reached her slightly slack lips, he found the texture to be even softer and<br>
<br>
more supple. They reminded him of ripe fruit and looked like they would taste sweet.<br>
<br>
It wouldn't have been impossible for him to taste that sweetness in that moment,<br>
<br>
when she was this vulnerable. He could have enjoyed that delicious fruit and savored<br>
<br>
it as he pleased.<br>
<br>
But Amane's self-control, and the knowledge that he would never recover if Mahiru<br>
<br>
rejected him, kept him back. Yet he couldn't stop touching her altogether. Amane<br>
<br>
laughed at himself for being such a coward, and he stared at Mahiru, whose beautiful<br>
<br>
sleeping face was so generously exposed.<br>
<br>
She doesn't even know how I feel…<br>
<br>
Mahiru probably had no idea how anxious he got when she was overly careless like<br>
<br>
this.<br>
<br>
Unconsciously, Amane let out a huge sigh, gently stroked Mahiru's defenseless,<br>
<br>
sleeping face, and chuckled quietly.<br>
<br>
Amane felt like he was being a shameful wimp, even more than usual. On the other<br>
<br>
hand, he was also convinced that his cowardice was what had allowed him to win<br>
<br>
Mahiru's trust.<br>
<br>
It occurred to him that if he had gained her trust to this degree, he might be on the<br>
<br>
way to getting her to like him.<br>
<br>
Even if he wanted to confess his feelings, he was too much of a weakling, too anxious<br>
<br>
about opening up to her.<br>
<br>
"…If I could simply tell you I love you, I wouldn't have any worries," he grumbled 2<br>
<br>
quietly.<br>
<br>
With the pad of his thumb, Amane gently stroked her tender lips and sighed.<br>
<br>
The fact that the girl he loved trusted him this much and was here in this vulnerable<br>
<br>
state felt gratifying and lovely, but it was also torture. Before long, he was going to have<br>
<br>
to get her to understand the conflict he was feeling.<br>
<br>
He made up his mind to scold her a little bit when she woke up, then grabbed her by<br>
<br>
the shoulders and shook her.<br>
<br>
"Mahiru, wake up. It's time to go home."<br>
<br>
He shook her kind of hard, to prompt her to wake up.<br>
<br>
He could have stared at her adorable sleeping face forever, but if he looked too long,<br>
<br>
he was going to want to do something, and he wouldn't be able to sleep with her here<br>
<br>
anyway.<br>
<br>
He had reluctantly allowed her to stay over several times before, or maybe it would be<br>
<br>
more accurate to say he had lent her his bed. He knew that, as a last resort, he could<br>
<br>
let her sleep in his room.<br>
<br>
If possible, he wanted her to return to her own apartment. If Mahiru slept in Amane's<br>
<br>
bed, it would smell extremely sweet and nice, and that would cause him all sorts of<br>
<br>
difficulties until her scent faded, and he wanted to avoid that if he could.<br>
<br>
With that one goal, Amane shook Mahiru and gently slapped her soft cheeks. With<br>
<br>
extremely sluggish movements, she raised her eyelids with a flutter of her long<br>
<br>
eyelashes.<br>
<br>
However, the vibrant caramel-coloured eyes that peeked out from behind them seemed<br>
<br>
somewhat vacant and unfocused. He couldn't tell where she was looking, and her<br>
<br>
bleary eyes started to slip listlessly back behind the curtain of her eyelids.<br>
<br>
"Mahiru, I'm begging you, please wake up. Go sleep at home."<br>
<br>
"…Unh…"<br>
<br>
"Don't groan, just say yes."<br>
<br>
"…Yes…"<br>
<br>
She answered him in a mumbling voice that didn't sound like she understood the<br>
<br>
situation, so with his cheek twitching, Amane tried even harder to rouse her back to<br>
<br>
consciousness, shaking her harder but not so hard as to rattle her brain.<br>
<br>
It must have had some effect, because Mahiru showed him her eyes again, but—this<br>
<br>
time, she fell forward, directly against Amane, and buried her face in his chest.<br>
<br>
In a quiet, muffled voice, she mumbled, "Smells nice," as she rubbed her cheek against<br>
<br>
him. A small sound squeaked out from the back of Amane's throat when he heard her<br>
<br>
moaning.<br>
<br>
Seriously, this girl is…<br>
<br>
He tried to tear himself away from her slack body, so defenseless that he had to<br>
<br>
wonder if she wasn't doing it on purpose at this point, but he couldn't. At the same<br>
<br>
time, he felt the urge to stay just as he was, to wrap his arms around her and dote on<br>
<br>
her. It probably would have been best to immediately pull away and go bang his head<br>
<br>
on the wall.<br>
<br>
Biting his lip hard, Amane grabbed Mahiru's shoulders and slowly pushed her away<br>
<br>
from his body, and she looked up at him blankly, with dazed, spiritless eyes.<br>
<br>
"Mahiru, it's late already; how about you go home? We've got school tomorrow, you<br>
<br>
know, so if you oversleep, you'll have a hard time. I'll walk you to your door."<br>
<br>
Mahiru only lived next door, but she was definitely out of it, so he felt anxious about<br>
<br>
her leaving the apartment.<br>
<br>
Whether Mahiru had understood him or not, she said, "Good niii…" in a lifeless voice<br>
<br>
and staggered to her feet, which was a good sign. She looked like she might fall right<br>
<br>
back down on the floor, so Amane ended up rushing over to support her.<br>
<br>
She was wiped out from the tests, and on top of that, she had let him lie in her lap for<br>
<br>
a long time. Sitting still for so long must have been physically taxing. Sleepiness was<br>
<br>
bearing down on her, and she could hardly stand.<br>
<br>
…No way around it.<br>
<br>
Amane was sure that even if he lent her his shoulder and somehow got her as far as<br>
<br>
her door, she would still fall flat on her face the second she walked in.<br>
<br>
He sighed softly and gazed into Mahiru's face as she leaned her full weight on him.<br>
<br>
"Mahiru, you've reached your limit, so I'm going to take you to your room. Can I borrow<br>
<br>
your keys? I'm going with you into your apartment."<br>
<br>
He felt nervous about going into a girl's apartment and didn't like having to ask Mahiru<br>
<br>
for permission when she was obviously passed out. However, he figured that if she had<br>
<br>
to choose between that and staying over in a boy's apartment, she would probably<br>
<br>
prefer the former, no matter how many times she had done the latter already. Amane<br>
<br>
also knew he would be able to relax and sleep better if Mahiru was at home tucked<br>
<br>
into her own bed, instead of his.<br>
<br>
He had roused Mahiru enough to ask for her permission, which slightly eased his<br>
<br>
discomfort.<br>
<br>
In response to his question, Mahiru slowly nodded her head.<br>
<br>
After confirming her consent, Amane pulled the keys out of Mahiru's pocket, trying<br>
<br>
his best not to make contact with her hip while he did so, and cradled her in his arms.<br>
<br>
Mahiru must have been very tired, because she leaned into him and fell half asleep<br>
<br>
again. If Amane didn't get her back home soon, she was going to fall asleep right in his<br>
<br>
arms.<br>
<br>
He stepped out of his apartment, trying his best not to make much noise. He walked<br>
<br>
over to Mahiru's door and, still holding her, carefully unlocked it. Then he slowly<br>
<br>
carried her into the apartment.<br>
<br>
"…Pardon the intrusion."<br>
<br>
The interior was, of course, laid out the same way as his. Amane knew it had the same<br>
<br>
floor plan, so he also knew where the bedroom ought to be.<br>
<br>
But his heart started pounding the second he stepped in. Mahiru's apartment had a<br>
<br>
sweet, invigorating smell, and it was decorated differently from his. Her meticulous<br>
<br>
and tidy personality was evident. The flooring was polished to a high shine, and he<br>
<br>
couldn't spot any dirt worth mentioning. There was a mirror and some flowers sitting<br>
<br>
on the shoe cubby that stood against the wall, which gave the place a subdued, yet<br>
<br>
bright and brilliant atmosphere.<br>
<br>
Amane glanced into the living room beyond the entryway. He got the impression that<br>
<br>
an adult had decorated it, with a collection of clean and cheerful furniture in basic<br>
<br>
tones of soft white and pale blue to go with the natural colors of the wood floor.<br>
<br>
Despite that, the apartment didn't really look like anyone lived in it. It showed hardly<br>
<br>
any signs of habitation. Besides sleeping and going to school, Mahiru had recently<br>
<br>
been spending most of her time over at Amane's apartment, so in a certain sense, it<br>
<br>
was almost like she wasn't living there.<br>
<br>
After having that realization, Amane quietly opened the door to the room he assumed<br>
<br>
was her bedroom and stepped inside.<br>
<br>
It was the first time in his life that he had been inside a girl's bedroom. It was such a<br>
<br>
lovely space that Amane thought other girls would get upset if they had to live up to<br>
<br>
this standard.<br>
<br>
Just like the living room, the basic colors were white and light blue, but it was fancier<br>
<br>
than the living room. He would best describe it as tidy and stylish.<br>
<br>
Amane also thought that it looked more lived-in and showcased Mahiru's personality<br>
<br>
more. The place was well-kept, as was Mahiru's habit. On top of the desk, next to her<br>
<br>
textbooks and cookbooks, sat the stuffed animal that she had won at the game center<br>
<br>
when Amane had taken her there.<br>
<br>
Also, the stuffed bear that he had gifted her for her last birthday was there, just as<br>
<br>
immaculate as on the day he'd given it. It was sitting beside her pillow on the bed, and<br>
<br>
it now had a navy-blue ribbon tied inconspicuously around it, mostly concealed by the<br>
<br>
original ribbon that had always been there.<br>
<br>
Amane had heard that she treasured the stuffed bear, but seeing in person that she<br>
<br>
had it sitting there by her pillow, he felt his cheeks grow hot.<br>
<br>
Imagining her sleeping with it every night was almost too much to stand.<br>
<br>
Biting the inside of his cheek in a desperate attempt to keep it together, Amane slowly<br>
<br>
lowered Mahiru onto the bed and covered her with the blanket. He was once again<br>
<br>
grateful that she had worn shorts with tights today.<br>
<br>
Maybe because she felt the sensation of her body sinking into the bed, Mahiru, who<br>
<br>
had been almost entirely asleep, opened her bleary eyes a little.<br>
<br>
Smiling in spite of himself at her sleepy expression, Amane got down on his knees and<br>
<br>
gently stroked Mahiru's head with the palm of his hand.<br>
<br>
"You're home now. I'll give your key back later, so don't worry about that."<br>
<br>
She had touched him plenty that day, so he figured it would be all right to touch her a<br>
<br>
little bit, too. As he scooped up a piece of hair that had fallen across her face to move<br>
<br>
it out of the way, he poked at her supple cheek, and she giggled like it tickled and put<br>
<br>
on a smile that was several times softer than usual.<br>
<br>
Without pause, with sleepy, bleary eyes, she patted the bed beside her. 4<br>
<br>
"…You too, Amane…" 3<br>
<br>
He froze as he considered what the rest of that sentence could mean.<br>
<br>
She seemed to be telling him to sleep there. Maybe even that she wanted him as a body<br>
<br>
pillow.<br>
<br>
…She doesn't mean that; she doesn't know what she's saying.<br>
<br>
Amane tried to persuade himself of this as he pushed back against certain desires that<br>
<br>
had momentarily threatened to lure him astray.<br>
<br>
He was afraid that if he lingered, Mahiru would say something unthinkable, so he<br>
<br>
impatiently stroked her head very gently, like he was putting a child to bed, and lulled<br>
<br>
her to sleep.<br>
<br>
"I'm going home now. Okay?"<br>
<br>
"…No."<br>
<br>
"There's no way I'm hanging around in a girl's bedroom. You'll absolutely regret asking<br>
<br>
once you wake up. I can already see you beating me with your pillow."<br>
<br>
If Amane joined her in bed, not only would he be unable to get a wink of sleep, but<br>
<br>
once she woke up, Mahiru would be confused and would turn bright red. Then, to hide<br>
<br>
her embarrassment, she was almost guaranteed to whack him with her pillow.<br>
<br>
He could also anticipate that afterward, things would get awkward between them, so<br>
<br>
for the sake of Amane's sanity and the next day's mood, he had to use all his willpower<br>
<br>
to get out of there.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was still dozing off, but seemed to be resisting sleep and Amane's frantic<br>
<br>
attempts to pacify her.<br>
<br>
In that case—Amane grabbed the bear from beside her and pushed it against her face.<br>
<br>
"This guy says he'll sleep here instead of me, so relax and go to bed."<br>
<br>
It appeared she had been keeping the stuffed animal close when she slept, so Amane<br>
<br>
decided to use it to lull her to sleep.<br>
<br>
He untangled his fingers from her soft hair and gently, gently whispered good night.<br>
<br>
Mahiru groaned in an adorable voice and embraced the stuffed bear in front of her.<br>
<br>
She looked innocent and childlike, a far cry from her usual prim and proper act, and<br>
<br>
so sweet that he wanted to caress her again.<br>
<br>
She was so charming that he might have spontaneously snapped a picture, if he'd had<br>
<br>
his smartphone on hand, and he felt relieved that he hadn't brought anything with him<br>
<br>
other than the key to his apartment. It would be very inappropriate to photograph a<br>
<br>
sleeping girl's face. He knew it was weird to even consider it.<br>
<br>
At last, Mahiru's eyelids, rimmed with long eyelashes, covered the entirety of her<br>
<br>
eyeballs, and she started breathing peacefully in her sleep.<br>
<br>
Amane sighed quietly, careful not to wake her again.<br>
<br>
…She's too careless. That was terrifying.<br>
<br>
Amane knew that she only behaved this way because she was with him. That didn't<br>
<br>
change the fact that it was difficult for him to watch the girl he loved let her guard<br>
<br>
down so completely like that.<br>
<br>
Praising himself for resisting temptation, Amane left Mahiru's room as silently as he<br>
<br>
could and walked right out of her apartment.<br>
<br>
He knew that it would take quite a bit of time before he was able to sleep that night.<br>
<br>
"G-good morning…"<br>
<br>
"M-morning…"<br>
<br>
Inevitably, the next day, the two of them each felt too awkward to look at the other.<br>
<br>
Mahiru almost never came to his apartment this early, but naturally, given what had<br>
<br>
happened, she had come over to talk.<br>
<br>
Amane had had difficulty falling asleep after everything that had happened yesterday,<br>
<br>
and it didn't make it any easier when she suddenly appeared first thing in the morning.<br>
<br>
He recalled the pleasant sensation of lying in her lap, the rich fruity scent, and the full<br>
<br>
softness that had come down on his head in the middle of it. Then the memory of<br>
<br>
Mahiru's apartment, which he had basically entered on his own, with permission at<br>
<br>
least, surfaced in his mind. Her cherubic sleeping face and sweet pleading voice were<br>
<br>
impossible to forget.<br>
<br>
He had spent the night tossing and turning in bed, tortured by how lovely she had<br>
<br>
looked while hugging the teddy bear.<br>
<br>
Writhing in agony, he had just finally managed to go to sleep when morning arrived,<br>
<br>
but he was awakened by his alarm, resulting in his current state of exhaustion.<br>
<br>
Mahiru, on the other hand, looked fresh and had a good complexion, as if she had slept<br>
<br>
just fine. She seemed very anxious, though, and constantly fidgeted like she was trying<br>
<br>
hard to conceal her embarrassment.<br>
<br>
Amane had been just about to eat breakfast when Mahiru had barged in. Now he was<br>
<br>
stuck, unsure of how to proceed.<br>
<br>
Her reward had been too exhilarating, and now that he knew that feeling, he found it<br>
<br>
hard to look at Mahiru directly. To make matters worse, Mahiru didn't seem to realize<br>
<br>
what had happened, so feelings of guilt weighed on his chest, in addition to the shame.<br>
<br>
"…Wh-what are you doing here in the morning? Oh, I know, you came to get your key<br>
<br>
back, right? Sorry for taking it home with me."<br>
<br>
"Ah, no, I… well, there is that, but that's not why I'm here."<br>
<br>
No matter how close they might be, Amane felt it was wrong to take home a girl's<br>
<br>
house key. He was already feeling bad about setting foot in her apartment, even though<br>
<br>
he hadn't really been able to avoid it.<br>
<br>
…As I suspected, she's mad that I saw her bedroom.<br>
<br>
Amane remembered her room being very neat and tidy, but he couldn't fault her for<br>
<br>
being upset that he had rudely taken a look while she was basically unconscious. If<br>
<br>
he'd happened to see her underwear or something hung up to dry, Mahiru probably<br>
<br>
wouldn't have looked at him or spoken to him for a while, and Amane was sure he<br>
<br>
would have had to avoid her for some time as well.<br>
<br>
Thankfully he hadn't caught sight of anything like that.<br>
<br>
"C-can I ask you one thing?" Mahiru inquired.<br>
<br>
"Sure."<br>
<br>
"…O-on top of my desk, there should have been a picture frame, but…"<br>
<br>
"A picture frame?" Amane asked.<br>
<br>
It wouldn't have been polite to scrutinize her room too closely, so Amane had only<br>
<br>
taken a quick look around, and he didn't particularly remember there being one. It<br>
<br>
sounded like it had been jumbled in with the rest of the stuff on her desk, judging by<br>
<br>
her tone.<br>
<br>
Amane searched his memory but had no recollection of a picture frame, so he figured<br>
<br>
he had just missed it.<br>
<br>
"No, I didn't see one, but… did something happen? Did I bump into it and break it, or<br>
<br>
something?"<br>
<br>
"N-no! A-as long as you didn't see it, that's fine… if you didn't see it."<br>
<br>
Apparently, Mahiru had something displayed in a picture frame that he wasn't<br>
<br>
supposed to see. Her obvious relief made him kind of wish he had. But it was a matter<br>
<br>
of privacy, so he wasn't going to say that out loud.<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked like a great weight had been lifted from her shoulders.<br>
<br>
Amane scratched his cheek. "I tried not to look at your room too much, you know? All<br>
<br>
I saw was the lineup of stuffed animals I gave you, and the teddy bear by your pillow<br>
<br>
that you sleep with…"<br>
<br>
"Forget you saw that!" Mahiru slapped Amane's arm softly.<br>
<br>
"But you already told me about it…," Amane answered without thinking.<br>
<br>
Mahiru glared at him. "Don't tell me I was hugging the stuffed animal while you were<br>
<br>
there."<br>
<br>
"…You were half asleep, and you demanded that I sleep there with you, which I wasn't<br>
<br>
about to do, so instead, I brought you the bear to sleep with."<br>
<br>
"Sleep there with me?!"<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked shocked, like she couldn't believe her own words. Gradually, her whole<br>
<br>
face turned red. 2<br>
<br>
She must not want to believe she said something like that when she was half asleep…<br>
<br>
"D-did I really say something like that?!"<br>
<br>
"N-not only did you say it, you actually called my name and patted the space beside<br>
<br>
you… like you were telling me to climb into the same bed…"<br>
<br>
"Aaugh!"<br>
<br>
Mahiru put her hands on her cheeks and made a pathetic noise. Her face was bright<br>
<br>
red, and her eyes were wavering like she might cry.<br>
<br>
"N-no way, I don't usually have such… thoughts! I just, um, I… felt relaxed since you<br>
<br>
were around, so… it's not that I really had any untoward desires… it must have been<br>
<br>
something like I wanted your b-body heat, that's it."<br>
<br>
"What's that supposed to mean?"<br>
<br>
"Please don't ask me anymore!"<br>
<br>
It was truly rare for Mahiru to raise her voice, and she was breathing hard as she<br>
<br>
sharply turned away.<br>
<br>
For once, Amane was the calm one. "F-fine, I don't really understand why you're so<br>
<br>
upset, but I'm not going to pry. Just be careful from now on. You were half asleep, but<br>
<br>
I did more or less get your permission before I took you home. But if you hadn't woken<br>
<br>
up, I was going to have to put you to bed in my room."<br>
<br>
"…That would have been fine."<br>
<br>
"What did you say?"<br>
<br>
"Nothing."<br>
<br>
Amane could tell that she had said something quietly, but he hadn't been able to make<br>
<br>
out Mahiru's mumbling. It seemed like it wasn't meant for him to hear.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, you've got to understand that no matter how much of a trusted friend I am,<br>
<br>
I can't just let you sleep here. If you try it again, I'll have no choice but to use you as a<br>
<br>
body pillow when I sleep, no joke."<br>
<br>
Though he had just made quite a bold claim, Amane knew that he wouldn't get any<br>
<br>
rest if something like that happened. He was just trying to warn Mahiru against being<br>
<br>
so careless. There were a few people she really trusted, but he still thought she ought<br>
<br>
to be more cautious, even around those companions.<br>
<br>
In response to Amane's slightly critical tone, Mahiru blinked dramatically, then put on<br>
<br>
a faint smile.<br>
<br>
"Says the same Amane who fell asleep so easily in my lap. You've dozed off in my lap<br>
<br>
twice now, you know?"<br>
<br>
"Th-that's a different conversation. It's a completely different matter for a guy to fall<br>
<br>
asleep in front of a member of the opposite sex than for a girl to do it. I wouldn't be in<br>
<br>
any danger."<br>
<br>
"…Even though you don't know for sure that I won't do anything?"<br>
<br>
"Would you?"<br>
<br>
"Let me think… Maybe I would take your picture or something, as a joke."<br>
<br>
Amane grew weak as Mahiru looked at him smugly, as if to say, "What do you think<br>
<br>
about that?" but Mahiru didn't seem to notice.<br>
<br>
"…I wouldn't really care, but now I'm going to have to check your phone."<br>
<br>
"And what if I saved it on the cloud before you realized, and then deleted it from my<br>
<br>
phone?<br>
<br>
"Stop talking about it. I'm starting to believe you might try and it's freaking me out. Also,<br>
<br>
my 'doing something' and your 'doing something' are different matters, so seriously, be<br>
<br>
more careful." Amane grabbed her shoulders and spoke soberly. "You're not<br>
<br>
understanding me at all."<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked surprised, but didn't pull away, and didn't avert her eyes, either. "I<br>
<br>
understand perfectly well. It's fine."<br>
<br>
"You really don't. Not even a little."<br>
<br>
"How rude! I said I do. I think you're underestimating me."<br>
<br>
"If you understood, you wouldn't be doing these things."<br>
<br>
"…You still need work, Amane."<br>
<br>
Amane frowned, not sure why she was getting so frustrated with him, but Mahiru just<br>
<br>
sighed softly, slipped out of his grasp, and headed for the hallway.<br>
<br>
In Mahiru's hand was the house key that she had come to collect, which she must have<br>
<br>
grabbed without him noticing. He had left it on the tray on top of his shoe cubby in the<br>
<br>
entryway of his apartment.<br>
<br>
"You have some thinking to do, Amane," she said as she left his apartment.<br>
<br>
Amane thought that she might just as well direct that line at herself. Holding his<br>
<br>
forehead, he grumbled, "Which one of us doesn't understand?" 2<br>
 <br>
Chapter 48: : The Angel’s New Clothes<br>
<br>
Exams were over, and it was the middle of May.<br>
<br>
The sun's gentle rays grew brighter as it created a springlike atmosphere. It was that<br>
<br>
time of the year when it was starting to get uncomfortable to wear long sleeves.<br>
<br>
May was supposed to be the time for a seasonal change of clothing, but the work of<br>
<br>
pulling out his short-sleeved shirts and summer slacks was awfully troublesome, and<br>
<br>
Amane had been putting it off.<br>
<br>
Though the air conditioners in school were set to the perfect temperature, as soon as<br>
<br>
he took a single step outside the classroom, or set off to and from school, he felt hot.<br>
<br>
Eventually, Amane came to the decision that it was time to get his summer clothes out.<br>
<br>
"It's getting to be the season when we'll want short sleeves, huh?" Mahiru asked. She'd<br>
<br>
nodded in understanding as she watched him pull his summer clothes out of a<br>
<br>
garment case that he stored in the back of his closet and threw them into the washing<br>
<br>
machine to wear for tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, Mahiru was also still dressing in long sleeves and tights, in a way that<br>
<br>
avoided exposing any unnecessary skin.<br>
<br>
She had switched to wearing a sweater vest under her blazer, but looking at her all<br>
<br>
covered up, Amane worried that she might be hot.<br>
<br>
"The weather is changing, and I've been feeling a little sweaty. I'm thinking it's about<br>
<br>
time for me to phase out my long sleeves, too. Today was really warm, wasn't it?"<br>
<br>
"You never let your clothes get sloppy, eh, Mahiru? You button everything up properly,<br>
<br>
and don't roll your sleeves up, and you usually have tights on…"<br>
<br>
"People always stare at me when I let any skin show, and it really bothers me. I feel<br>
<br>
compelled to dress that way… It's like a form of self-defense."<br>
<br>
Mahiru was beautiful and had a very keen sense of style, so she was often troubled by<br>
<br>
people's gawking.<br>
<br>
No matter what, she attracted attention, and that often included inappropriate stares.<br>
<br>
Amane wasn't unsympathetic to the fact that men were naturally inclined to look at<br>
<br>
beautiful women, but he could tell that Mahiru hated to be ogled.<br>
<br>
"I'm never sure how to dress for summer," she said. "Last year, I wore some really thin<br>
<br>
black stockings, but they were still pretty warm."<br>
<br>
"Seems like they would be. Girls have to wear more pieces of clothing than guys do,<br>
<br>
which seems like it would be hot…"<br>
<br>
"Well, I can put up with a little warmth if I'm doing it to protect myself, but… the issue<br>
<br>
of overheating is a real problem."<br>
<br>
Mahiru sighed and said she hated summer for that reason. Amane didn't know how<br>
<br>
he should answer and ended up staying silent. Mahiru didn't seem to mind, and let her<br>
<br>
gaze wander over to the washing machine.<br>
<br>
"So you'll start wearing your summer clothes tomorrow?" she asked.<br>
<br>
"Well, I was thinking it's about time to change. It's already this sweltering…"<br>
<br>
"I see. I've also been considering it, but before I can go to school, I feel like I've got to<br>
<br>
try everything on at least once to check the fit. I think my size hasn't changed, but just<br>
<br>
in case…"<br>
<br>
Mahiru seemed very concerned about maintaining her figure, and it didn't seem like<br>
<br>
she would have let herself get out of shape.<br>
<br>
Amane admired her strong willpower and discipline. He knew that he could never be<br>
<br>
as strict with himself as Mahiru was with herself, but he wished that he too had an<br>
<br>
ideal body that he could maintain. First, he would have to start by getting his ideal<br>
<br>
body, though.<br>
<br>
"I'd better try mine on, too, or it could be bad. I've gotten a little taller since starting<br>
<br>
school, so if they don't fit, I'll have to buy new ones at the school store."<br>
<br>
Amane had purchased his summer uniform before starting high school, so now that<br>
<br>
he was in his second year, he was worried it might be a little short on him. It had been<br>
<br>
fine during the summer of his first year, and he hadn't had any problems with his<br>
<br>
winter uniform, but his clothes might have become a little bit too tight for him, even<br>
<br>
though he'd initially bought them a bit larger.<br>
<br>
He had grown more than five centimeters since starting high school, and there was a<br>
<br>
good chance his summer clothes were too small.<br>
<br>
Thinking he would try them on after the laundry was finished, Amane gazed over at<br>
<br>
the washing machine, which was making a dull mechanical noise.<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked up at him.<br>
<br>
"…You're pretty tall, aren't you, Amane?"<br>
<br>
"Well, I guess I'm a little taller than average."<br>
<br>
Amane was about one head taller than Mahiru, who was still staring up at him.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had a petite build, but that didn't mean she was particularly small; in fact, she<br>
<br>
was average. Amane's eyeline was just a little higher than it had been when he had<br>
<br>
first met her, which made him realize again that he had been growing.<br>
<br>
Usually, he stood at a bit of a distance when talking to Mahiru, so as not to overtax her<br>
<br>
neck, but recently, she had been standing much closer to him, enough to touch, and<br>
<br>
he'd started to worry about her neck getting cramps.<br>
<br>
Mahiru didn't seem to care about such things at the moment. She was scrutinizing<br>
<br>
Amane and frowning slightly.<br>
<br>
"…I do worry about you, though. You don't weigh very much, for how tall you are."<br>
<br>
"That's why I'm exercising and training to put on more muscle," he replied. "More<br>
<br>
importantly, why do you know how much I weigh, anyway?"<br>
<br>
"Because I saw you weigh yourself on the scale by the sink when you woke up late one<br>
<br>
weekend. I was the one who pushed you over to the sink, when you were half asleep."<br>
<br>
There was nothing Amane could say to that, so he stayed quiet, but Mahiru looked at<br>
<br>
him with exasperation in her eyes.<br>
<br>
"It looks like you're working hard, and I see you putting in the effort, but you've got to<br>
<br>
eat a little more after you exercise, Amane. You're thin, and it makes me worry. After<br>
<br>
all, food is what builds the body, right? If you tell me ahead of time when you're going<br>
<br>
to exercise, I can adjust the menu."<br>
<br>
"I'm really making a lot of work for you, but… I'm grateful for the offer. And since we're<br>
<br>
still on the topic, you're kind of thin yourself. Sometimes I worry you might break, so<br>
<br>
you should eat more, too, please."<br>
<br>
Of course, Amane was grateful; he never had to worry about meals thanks to Mahiru.<br>
<br>
She was even gracious enough to prepare extra food to help with his weight training.<br>
<br>
But he thought that Mahiru herself ought to eat more, too. He could tell she was<br>
<br>
delicate even through her clothes, and occasionally when he touched her, she was so<br>
<br>
thin that he was anxious he might break her. From what he had seen, she had never<br>
<br>
been one to eat that much, which probably made it easier for her to manage her figure,<br>
<br>
but it concerned him that she was so petite.<br>
<br>
"You're super thin," he said, and grabbed her narrow waist, realizing just how lean her<br>
<br>
body really was.<br>
<br>
A high-pitched shriek came from Mahiru's mouth, and the sound interrupted any<br>
<br>
further thoughts.<br>
<br>
"…Ah, s-sorry," he fumbled.<br>
<br>
"N-no, it's fine, it's okay," Mahiru said. "Just, if you touch a girl's belly too much… there<br>
<br>
are girls who develop complexes about that stuff, okay?"<br>
<br>
"I'm really sorry for touching you like that. It's sexual harassment to touch a girl's body<br>
<br>
without asking, isn't it? I'm very, very sorry."<br>
<br>
"Okay, you don't have to go that far…"<br>
<br>
Although they were good friends, they were still the opposite sex, so naturally, Amane<br>
<br>
was very careful about how he touched Mahiru.<br>
<br>
But he had just touched her stomach—not her head, or her hand, or her shoulder, but<br>
<br>
her stomach, a very personal location. He had gotten worked up about how thin she<br>
<br>
was, but that was no excuse, and he immediately regretted touching her belly without<br>
<br>
her permission.<br>
<br>
"I don't really mind it that much, so calm down, Amane. And anyway, I don't suppose<br>
<br>
you do things like that with anyone other than me?"<br>
<br>
"I don't have this kind of back-and-forth with anyone other than you," he answered.<br>
<br>
"Also, I hardly ever interact with any other girls. It's not like I would randomly touch a<br>
<br>
girl I don't know that well."<br>
<br>
The only other girl he might possibly touch would be Chitose. She was slim, a bit like<br>
<br>
Mahiru, but it was more of a lean athleticism, different from Mahiru's petite delicacy.<br>
<br>
Though he would never even really touch Chitose like that in the first place, aside from<br>
<br>
occasionally, playfully bopping her on the head.<br>
<br>
"Well, I'm glad to hear that," Mahiru nodded. She seemed satisfied with Amane's<br>
<br>
answer. Then, maybe as payback, she leaned forward and pressed her palm against<br>
<br>
Amane's stomach, touching him through his shirt.<br>
<br>
He wasn't going to scold her, considering he had just done the same to her, but it<br>
<br>
tickled, and he felt embarrassed about his body.<br>
<br>
Compared to how he had been before Mahiru had improved his diet, he was healthier<br>
<br>
now, but his body was still a far cry from his ideal muscular figure.<br>
<br>
It had been quite a shock to hear that she was worried about him being too thin, so he<br>
<br>
knew he needed to eat and exercise more to build muscle onto his frame.<br>
<br>
"…Do you think I'd be better if I were a little stronger, Mahiru?"<br>
<br>
"Strong is nice, but I think that at the end of the day, the most attractive type of body,<br>
<br>
for either sex, is a healthy body. Also, this is my personal opinion as a girl, and I would<br>
<br>
absolutely never want to force it on anyone else, but… when a girl is standing next to<br>
<br>
a really skinny guy, there's a possibility that she will feel awkward, so maybe a medium<br>
<br>
build is better than being all skin and bones."<br>
<br>
"I see…"<br>
<br>
"B-but you're not necessarily… I wouldn't go so far as to say you're too thin, okay,<br>
<br>
Amane? But it would be healthier for you to eat a little more. You're not the type to<br>
<br>
overeat, despite being a high school boy. Speaking of which, Amane, um, when it comes<br>
<br>
to girls… do you like slim ones best?"<br>
<br>
"It's rude to comment on girls' physiques," Amane answered immediately. It was<br>
<br>
something he thought every guy was supposed to know.<br>
<br>
Both his parents always told him, "If you say something, and it goes over poorly, prepare<br>
<br>
to see blood," so Amane always avoided commenting on anybody's figure.<br>
<br>
"Ah…" Mahiru sounded like she understood his flat assertion, and her gaze drifted off<br>
<br>
into the distance. He figured that girls must have the same understanding.<br>
<br>
"Well, I guess it's better to be on the slim side," Amane said. "But if you're too thin, it's<br>
<br>
worrisome, because it can be bad for your health and might mean you're not getting<br>
<br>
enough nutrients. It gives peace of mind to see that someone has the proper amount<br>
<br>
of muscle and fat on them."<br>
<br>
"…That sounds more like something a parent would say than something you'd hear<br>
<br>
from a young man, don't you think?"<br>
<br>
"You're one to talk."<br>
<br>
"Fair enough, but…"<br>
<br>
If anything, Mahiru was the one who had a motherly attitude sometimes. So Amane<br>
<br>
didn't think she had any right to accuse him of having a "parental" gaze or whatever.<br>
<br>
"Even if I'm not worried about you, I don't think there's any need for you to be on a<br>
<br>
diet, Mahiru."<br>
<br>
"Really?"<br>
<br>
"Where could you possibly lose it from? You've got your ideal body, and now you're<br>
<br>
trying to maintain it, right? It's not my place to say anything, but I think the best body<br>
<br>
for you is one you feel confident about. And personally, I would worry if you got too<br>
<br>
thin, so I'd like you to stay just as you are."<br>
<br>
He would definitely be concerned if Mahiru, who was already quite thin, lost any more<br>
<br>
weight. He wanted her to know that her figure was fine just as it was. If she wanted to<br>
<br>
get any skinnier, he would have to stop her.<br>
<br>
"I understand that it's difficult to maintain a certain figure, but I think it's more<br>
<br>
important to be healthy."<br>
<br>
"…Sure."<br>
<br>
Almost in rhythm with Mahiru's nodding head, the washing machine continued<br>
<br>
tumbling his laundry around with a loud rattle.<br>
<br>
"Good morning."<br>
<br>
The following morning, when Amane woke up, Mahiru was there in his apartment.<br>
<br>
He turned around and looked behind him at the clock in his bedroom. It was time to<br>
<br>
get up and ready for the day, not time to leave his apartment yet.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had visited his apartment a handful of times in the morning before, but it was<br>
<br>
something that generally didn't happen, so Amane's sleepy mind was confused.<br>
<br>
"…Morning?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru had a spare key, and he had told her she could come in as she pleased, but he<br>
<br>
hadn't expected to encounter her so early in the day.<br>
<br>
When, in his bewilderment, he returned her greeting with a questioning tone, Mahiru<br>
<br>
put on a gentle smile.<br>
<br>
"I know it might be rude for me to come over like this in the morning, but… I was<br>
<br>
hoping I could get you to check something for me before I left home."<br>
<br>
"Check something?"<br>
<br>
At that point, he took a second look at Mahiru and realized that he could see a bit more<br>
<br>
skin than usual.<br>
<br>
"I changed my clothes. Does anything look off?"<br>
<br>
"Ah, summer clothes… uhh, no, well—"<br>
<br>
"Yes?"<br>
<br>
"…I'm not sure having your legs bare… is a good idea."<br>
<br>
Summer clothes meant short sleeves, but that wasn't what Amane was talking about.<br>
<br>
When he looked down, he could see her pure, pale thighs peeking out from under her<br>
<br>
skirt.<br>
<br>
School uniforms featured longer skirts than most street clothes, and Mahiru usually<br>
<br>
wore tights as well, so he hadn't gotten a good look at her bare legs before. In keeping<br>
<br>
with school rules, Mahiru's new skirt was plenty long enough to keep everything<br>
<br>
covered, but even so, her bare legs were now exposed to the air.<br>
<br>
Amane was understandably flustered, and his eyes darted around nervously.<br>
<br>
"Well, I was thinking that not many girls wear tights at school right now," Mahiru said.<br>
<br>
"That's true, b-but I don't think it's right for y-you. It's no good."<br>
<br>
"Is that because you can't handle seeing my bare legs?"<br>
<br>
"Th-that's not it!" he protested. "It's more like, if you show them off, the other boys<br>
<br>
will probably make a fuss and stare, so it's a bad idea, I think."<br>
<br>
The day before, they'd had a whole conversation about Mahiru's black stockings.<br>
<br>
Amane had never thought she would appear without them.<br>
<br>
The pale expanse of her legs was too dazzling. He couldn't look right at them.<br>
<br>
"You sure you're not going to stare, too, Amane?"<br>
<br>
"Everything has a limit, you know!"<br>
<br>
"But it's a fact that you saw my legs when I twisted my ankle, remember?"<br>
<br>
"That was an emergency, and anyway, I was a perfect gentleman! I even covered your<br>
<br>
lap with my blazer, didn't I?!"<br>
<br>
Sure, he might have caught a peek at her legs when he'd knelt down beside her, but<br>
<br>
he'd been careful to drape his blazer over her so that he couldn't see anything<br>
<br>
untoward. He'd devoted all of his attention to treating her ankle so that he wouldn't<br>
<br>
look anywhere inappropriate. Hence, he had honestly never ogled Mahiru's legs. Even<br>
<br>
Amane knew better than that.<br>
<br>
"Well, are you having any imprudent thoughts right now?"<br>
<br>
"…No."<br>
<br>
"The way you hesitated is a bit worrying."<br>
<br>
"No!"<br>
<br>
"Don't get all worked up. Sorry for teasing you too much. I've known from the start<br>
<br>
that you weren't looking at me like that. You just don't know where you should be<br>
<br>
directing your attention."<br>
<br>
"If you knew that, then you shouldn't have felt the need to question me…"<br>
<br>
"No, it was necessary for my own satisfaction. Making your heart pound is the most<br>
<br>
important part, you see." 2<br>
<br>
"So you did this just to give me a heart attack?"<br>
<br>
Clearly, Mahiru had wanted to start the day with a bit of fun.<br>
<br>
Amane looked at her grudgingly as he realized that he'd fallen for it, hook, line, and<br>
<br>
sinker. Mahiru, the prankster, just stared back at him, grinning in her elegant way.<br>
<br>
"Relax," she said. "I brought stockings with me, and I was planning to put them on."<br>
<br>
"Unbelievable…" Amane groaned, knowing she was trying to get a rise out of him. Then<br>
<br>
he decided to get a little bit of revenge and stared back into Mahiru's caramel-coloured<br>
<br>
eyes that were twinkling happily.<br>
<br>
"…So you don't mind me looking at you?"<br>
<br>
"Huh?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru stared at him in surprise.<br>
<br>
Without breaking eye contact, Amane continued, "You went out of your way to come<br>
<br>
show me your bare legs. That must mean you want me to look at them, right?"<br>
<br>
"…That's, um, I don't really mind… if you see them—"<br>
<br>
"You don't think it's a big deal…"<br>
<br>
Mahiru seemed very confused. "That's not—it's not necessarily the case, though…"<br>
<br>
Amane sighed softly. "Well then, don't show me. You should only do things like that for<br>
<br>
people you want to look at you."<br>
<br>
He wished she would put herself in his shoes and imagine what it was like for a guy to<br>
<br>
see a new side of a girl he loved. But of course, he couldn't say anything like that. It<br>
<br>
was only the start of the day, and already he was feeling exhausted.<br>
<br>
Timidly, Mahiru tugged at the sleeve of Amane's pajamas. "…Wh-what if I said I came<br>
<br>
to show you because I wanted to?" 5<br>
<br>
Her quiet voice trembled bashfully as she looked up at him with watery eyes. This<br>
<br>
time, Amane completely froze up.<br>
<br>
"Because I wanted to see your reaction… But all you said was that it's no good," Mahiru<br>
<br>
mumbled, looking a little dejected.<br>
<br>
Amane shook his head frantically. "Th-that's because it's not. Look, how do I say this?<br>
<br>
It's troublesome, like… I don't know where I'm supposed to be looking…"<br>
<br>
"So you think bare legs don't suit me?"<br>
<br>
Amane reluctantly looked down at Mahiru's outfit. She was dressed in a crisp, ironed<br>
<br>
short-sleeved blouse and skirt. The outfit exuded her usual tidy elegance, while also<br>
<br>
giving off a fresher image, and the buttons and ribbon on her shirt, done properly all<br>
<br>
the way up to her neck, were a reminder of her serious nature.<br>
<br>
Amane might have preferred it if it were a little harder to see all the angles and curves<br>
<br>
of her figure, but these were her summer clothes, so there was nothing to be done<br>
<br>
about it.<br>
<br>
He looked her over once, trying as best he could not to let his eyes linger on her<br>
<br>
perfect, slender legs, then slowly opened his mouth to speak, a little fraught.<br>
<br>
"…You look very cute, and those clothes suit you, so please, go put on your stockings<br>
<br>
immediately."<br>
<br>
"Okay."<br>
<br>
Mahiru must have been satisfied by these brief, carefully chosen words of praise<br>
<br>
because she gave Amane a gentle, broad smile and nodded.<br>
<br>
Momentarily struck speechless by that smile, Amane turned away before Mahiru<br>
<br>
could notice, looking toward the bathroom sink.<br>
<br>
"Don't come playing tricks on me like this again. I'm going to wash my face and change,<br>
<br>
so while I do that, please sort your clothes out and get ready to leave," he said, speaking<br>
<br>
somewhat more quickly than usual, and hurried into the bathroom.<br>
<br>
Mahiru giggled softly behind his back.<br>
<br>
Amane finished getting dressed for the day, and when he headed into the living room,<br>
<br>
Mahiru was sitting quietly on the sofa waiting for him. She was fully covered, in black<br>
<br>
stockings and a sweater vest. Amane wondered if what he'd seen earlier had even<br>
<br>
been real.<br>
<br>
He couldn't help but feel exhausted by the whole affair.<br>
<br>
"…You know, if you'd shown me this look from the start, I would have been able to offer<br>
<br>
you an honest opinion, without worrying about how my heart is going to hold up."<br>
<br>
"How nice for you; you got a special treat." 1<br>
<br>
Mahiru grinned shamelessly, which made him a little angry. He walked up to her and<br>
<br>
pinched her cheek, but she still kept smiling happily.<br>
<br>
"…Well then, I'm going to leave for school ahead of you," Mahiru said, standing up from<br>
<br>
her seat after watching Amane devour the breakfast she'd prepared.<br>
<br>
To get him back in a good mood, she had made a rolled omelet. Amane was fully aware<br>
<br>
of her ploy, but couldn't help feeling better anyway and went with her to the door to<br>
<br>
see her off.<br>
<br>
They walked the same route to the same school, so it seemed a little ridiculous to leave<br>
<br>
separately. Even so, there was no way they could arrive at school together, thus the<br>
<br>
only other option was to stagger when they left.<br>
<br>
"See you at school," Amane said. He was planning to wait long enough to avoid<br>
<br>
suspicion, as always, but he noticed that Mahiru was wearing a somewhat dissatisfied<br>
<br>
expression. He tilted his head questioningly. "What is it?"<br>
<br>
"…Just wondering if there will ever come a day when we can walk together."<br>
<br>
"The stares alone would kill me."<br>
<br>
Recently, Amane had been seen interacting with Mahiru more and more often, and<br>
<br>
their classmates seemed to have gotten used to it, to a certain degree. However, Amane<br>
<br>
still received many jealous looks, and when it came to the students in other<br>
<br>
classrooms, they often glared at him.<br>
<br>
Amane was already fed up with being on the receiving end of their overly aggressive<br>
<br>
stares, and if he and Mahiru started going to and from school together, the negative<br>
<br>
attention was sure to increase to a level he had never yet experienced.<br>
<br>
"I suppose that's to be expected," Mahiru sighed. "…Though we're just reaping what<br>
<br>
we've sown, at this point. It's all so exhaustingly inconvenient."<br>
<br>
"I imagine that having everyone at school make a big deal of you just walking with a<br>
<br>
guy would be pretty unbearable for you, too, no?"<br>
<br>
"Actually, I don't really care if anyone makes a big deal out of it, but I know it would<br>
<br>
cause trouble for you. If it didn't bother you, I'd be more than happy to go together."<br>
<br>
"…You're sure about that?"<br>
<br>
"If our timing matches up, that is. It's a pain to go out of our way to stagger the times<br>
<br>
we leave, and it's inefficient on days like this. Besides, isn't it more fun to walk to school<br>
<br>
with someone you like?" 3<br>
<br>
"That's true, but—"<br>
<br>
"Isn't it? I guess reality doesn't always go the way we want it to."<br>
<br>
After a big, exhausted yawn, Mahiru shook her head once and then transformed before<br>
<br>
his eyes, putting on her usual elegant, angelic smile.<br>
<br>
"All right, I'm off. I wanted to show you my new summer look first thing in the morning,<br>
<br>
so I'm glad I was able to come do that," Mahiru said casually. She batted her eyes at<br>
<br>
Amane, who was still frozen in place by her provocative statement.<br>
<br>
"See you later," she said as she opened the front door. "Make sure not to be late, okay,<br>
<br>
Amane?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru slipped bashfully past the doorway and set off for school. Amane leaned his<br>
<br>
head against the wall of the hallway for a little while, then decided he should go wash<br>
<br>
his face again. He was seriously worried about what was to come.<br>
<br>
Amane left his apartment late enough to give Mahiru a solid head start. When he<br>
<br>
finally arrived at school, he was not surprised to see people gathered around her,<br>
<br>
checking out her new outfit.<br>
<br>
The temperature had been steadily rising, and it was definitely time for new clothes<br>
<br>
to match the season. Plenty of students had already changed into short sleeves.<br>
<br>
Even though Mahiru was wearing lighter summer clothing, she looked very prim and<br>
<br>
proper in it. Though because of her gorgeous appearance, her change of outfit still<br>
<br>
attracted more attention than usual.<br>
<br>
On top of all that, Chitose had gotten to her seat and declared, "That hairstyle looks<br>
<br>
like it's sooo warm!" and tied Mahiru's hair up in a ponytail for her. The unusual<br>
<br>
hairstyle was drawing even more stares—with her hair up, the nape of Mahiru's neck<br>
<br>
was visible.<br>
<br>
Amane didn't like that much. Mahiru was obviously free to style her hair any way she 7<br>
<br>
wished, but he couldn't help but feel upset that other people were staring at the girl<br>
<br>
he loved.<br>
<br>
…How can I think that way? She doesn't belong to me.<br>
<br>
Amane glanced over at Mahiru again, practically seething with unwarranted jealousy.<br>
<br>
He was starting to hate himself for it.<br>
<br>
Itsuki peered at Amane with that strangely perceptive look of his. "Oh, are we feeling<br>
<br>
a little out of sorts?" he asked slyly.<br>
<br>
Amane brushed him off with feigned ignorance. "…Must be your imagination."<br>
<br>
Then for some reason, Itsuki looked over at Mahiru and nodded like he understood<br>
<br>
everything.<br>
<br>
When he looked back at Amane, he was smiling, or rather grinning. Amane could feel<br>
<br>
himself getting even more flustered.<br>

"Amane, pass it here!"<br>
<br>
"But you've got terrible control!"<br>
<br>
The school Sports Day was coming up next month, and the students were leisurely<br>
<br>
enjoying gym class.<br>
<br>
Remembering the previous Sports Day, Amane knew once the teams were announced<br>
<br>
sometime next week, the whole school would start preparing for it, but for now, they<br>
<br>
were still having regular gym classes.<br>
<br>
Listening to the echo of the basketball club's squeaking shoes, Amane glared at Itsuki,<br>
<br>
who had thrown the ball sloppily into the wall as a joke, and chased after the ball as it<br>
<br>
rolled away.<br>
<br>
They were playing basketball that day, and soon it would be time to practice their<br>
<br>
shots. It sounded like they were going to have a game during the second half of class.<br>
<br>
Amane wasn't particularly good at basketball, but he didn't mind tossing the ball into<br>
<br>
the hoop a bit.<br>
<br>
As Amane chased the old, brown basketball rolling slowly away from the wall, he shot<br>
<br>
a quick glance across the net dividing the gym in two. On the other side, the girls' class<br>
<br>
was playing badminton. The girls were supposed to have been outside, but due to a<br>
<br>
sudden downpour, everyone was having gym inside the divided gymnasium.<br>
<br>
The girls also seemed to be playing leisurely, and from time to time, Amane would<br>
<br>
catch sight of one of them lightly batting the shuttlecock with their racket. He grabbed<br>
<br>
the ball and jogged back.<br>
<br>
He was careful not to even look in Mahiru's direction. He wanted to avoid any chance<br>
<br>
of anybody noticing and accusing him of having a crush on the angel.<br>
<br>
He did like her, but he knew it would be troubling for her to hear those sorts of rumors.<br>
<br>
He also didn't want to let any unfamiliar classmates know about it, so he kept it a<br>
<br>
secret.<br>
<br>
"Stop throwing the ball off in weird directions," Amane said. "It'll be awkward if I have<br>
<br>
to go get it from the girls' side."<br>
<br>
Itsuki grinned foolishly. "Come on, don't be so sensitive."<br>
<br>
Amane threw the ball with a little force at his friend's stomach, and Itsuki, who wasn't<br>
<br>
particularly bad at sports, caught it without breaking his grin. With a long sigh, Amane<br>
<br>
got a new ball from the ball hamper.<br>
<br>
The members of the sports clubs were always in high spirits during these sorts of gym<br>
<br>
classes. This time, it was the basketball club that was in their element, and they were<br>
<br>
especially lively.<br>
<br>
Amane didn't really like basketball, but he was surprisingly fond of shooting practice,<br>
<br>
so he had been throwing the ball at the basket all class, to show the gym teacher that<br>
<br>
he was taking it seriously.<br>
<br>
He threw another ball. It arced through the air, rebounded off the backboard, and fell<br>
<br>
through the center of the basket. Amane retrieved it with a slight feeling of satisfaction.<br>
<br>
"You're good at this kind of thing," Itsuki observed. "Though whenever a game starts<br>
<br>
up, you lose all your motivation, and then you're useless. You should try harder."<br>
<br>
"Be quiet. You can't expect someone who's a natural-born introverted member of the<br>
<br>
'go-home club' to put in a ton of effort in a basketball game. Obviously, the guys in the<br>
<br>
sports clubs are going to be the ones actually playing."<br>
<br>
"I guess so. Hey, I was just thinking, you ought to show that special someone how cool<br>
<br>
you can be from time to time."<br>
<br>
Amane knew exactly who Itsuki was referring to, but he wasn't going to just nod<br>
<br>
obediently.<br>
<br>
"I don't need you to worry about that," he said. "She already knows that I'm no good at<br>
<br>
sports and that I'm very uncool."<br>
<br>
"Why do you always have to turn it around like that?"<br>
<br>
"You have to know by now that telling me to make an effort here is a losing proposition,<br>
<br>
right?"<br>
<br>
Amane looked at Itsuki, who seemed disinterested in the outcome, with a sour<br>
<br>
expression, and was confronted with more cackling laughter.<br>
<br>
"Come on now, this is your chance," Itsuki urged.<br>
<br>
"It is not. Why don't you give it a try then, see how it goes?"<br>
<br>
"Huh? No way, man. I'm not that good."<br>
<br>
"Well then, where do you get off telling me what to do?"<br>
<br>
Amane grabbed Itsuki under the chin and squeezed his cheeks with his fingers,<br>
<br>
warning him not to casually demand things that he couldn't do himself.<br>
<br>
"Sorry, sorry!" As he was laughing it off, Itsuki looked over to the other side of the net.<br>
<br>
"But she is looking over here, though."<br>
<br>
"Huh?"<br>
<br>
Amane followed Itsuki's gaze and saw Mahiru, waiting her turn to play badminton,<br>
<br>
looking in his direction. Staring, to be more accurate. She was definitely staring at<br>
<br>
Amane.<br>
<br>
She was probably just killing time by looking around, but Amane suddenly started<br>
<br>
feeling uncomfortable, now that he knew he was being watched. He pursed his lips<br>
<br>
awkwardly.<br>
<br>
Itsuki mumbled, "Better try your best," like he was glad it wasn't his problem, and<br>
<br>
pulled Amane along with him after the gym teacher's whistle sounded.<br>
<br>
For the practice game in the second half, the class was divided into two teams, to play<br>
<br>
against two different teams from another class.<br>
<br>
Amane and Itsuki were playing in the second round, so to avoid getting in the way of<br>
<br>
the rest of the players, they climbed up onto the stage at the end of the gym and took<br>
<br>
a seat.<br>
<br>
The two of them were watching the imposing figure of Yuuta, who was on the team<br>
<br>
playing the first game. He was putting on a good show.<br>
<br>
"How is Kadowaki keeping up against the actual basketball club…?"<br>
<br>
Some of the players on the opposing team were in the basketball club, but Yuuta played<br>
<br>
well enough to put them on equal footing. Even though Yuuta was an experienced<br>
<br>
athlete, at the end of the day, he could not match them point for point. If it had just<br>
<br>
been a matter of speed, the track star might have had an advantage, but when it came<br>
<br>
to agility and handling, not to mention the coordination required to shoot the ball, the<br>
<br>
members of the basketball club were able to show off their specialized skills.<br>
<br>
Amane had expected the basketball club would have an advantage and that his<br>
<br>
classmates would be entirely shut out, but Yuuta quickly disproved that prediction by<br>
<br>
continuing to score points.<br>
<br>
"Well, Yuuta's the product of an athletic family, after all," Itsuki said. "He just chose the<br>
<br>
track club because he likes running, but he can play just about any sport at a high<br>
<br>
level."<br>
<br>
"How is he so strong?"<br>
<br>
"Apparently, his mother was a sports trainer or something like that. I think he told me<br>
<br>
that his older sisters are going into related occupations, too."<br>
<br>
"So he's the result of a gifted education."<br>
<br>
"Whoa! Watch Kadowaki, guys!"<br>
<br>
"Block him, block him!"<br>
<br>
"Don't let him get anywhere!"<br>
<br>
"Are we sure he doesn't have some awful grudge against us?"<br>
<br>
"If he finds a good opening, this is really gonna look bad for the basketball club!"<br>
<br>
Amane was half-listening to the cries of the opposing team. He could also hear the girls<br>
<br>
cheering Yuuta on from across the partition.<br>
<br>
They seemed to have started their own tournament of badminton on the other side of<br>
<br>
the gym, and the girls who weren't actively playing had come up to the net to watch<br>
<br>
the game.<br>
<br>
The other boys, as well, were understandably enthusiastic about Yuuta's performance.<br>
<br>
Murmurs of admiration swept the crowd. For some reason, Itsuki slapped Amane on<br>
<br>
the back.<br>
<br>
In the end, their class was victorious in the first game. Amane jumped down from the<br>
<br>
stage, marveling at his amazing friend.<br>
<br>
Throwing on the team jersey he had been given, Amane stepped onto the court, not<br>
<br>
bothering to hide his expression of irritation, and accidentally made eye contact with<br>
<br>
Mahiru on the other side of the net.<br>
<br>
She was wearing a faint smile, different from her usual gentle, angelic type. It was<br>
<br>
Mahiru's real smile, the mellow one that she always showed him at home.<br>
<br>
There was a tenderness to her gaze, as she waved her hand slightly and slowly<br>
<br>
mouthed "Do your best!" at him.<br>
<br>
She didn't say it out loud, but Amane imagined he could hear it, and it was too much<br>
<br>
for him. He couldn't stand to look at her and turned away.<br>
<br>
His mistake was turning to face Itsuki.<br>
<br>
"Feeling fired up now?"<br>
<br>
"Shut up," Amane snapped back desperately. He felt completely transparent when he<br>
<br>
heard Itsuki laughing in an apparent effort to break the tension.<br>
<br>
"…I'm gonna die…" Amane groaned, squatting down to catch his breath. He was playing<br>
<br>
basketball seriously for the first time in a long time and pouring all his energy into it.<br>
<br>
His heart was pounding violently.<br>
<br>
Even though he had recently started to exercise a little more, he hadn't yet fully exerted<br>
<br>
himself like this and hadn't ever done such a strenuous workout. Coupled with the<br>
<br>
match, Amane was extremely exhausted.<br>
<br>
Amane coughed and slowly tried to get his breath back, but his heart was pounding<br>
<br>
away and showed no signs of calming down.<br>
<br>
During the match, he had accidentally taken a dramatic fall, so his battered body ached<br>
<br>
and his breathing was ragged. He was having a really hard time.<br>
<br>
Even though he had tried not to overdo it, clearly, he'd gotten carried away.<br>
<br>
I feel like I looked really pathetic out there.<br>
<br>
He'd fallen right in front of Mahiru. He felt depressed thinking about seeing her<br>
<br>
afterward in the classroom. Far from showing her how cool he could be, the only thing<br>
<br>
he'd shown off was how much of a loser he was.<br>
<br>
"Amaneee, you okay?" Itsuki asked, crouching down next to his friend to take a look at<br>
<br>
him. He must have seen Amane squatting off to the side while the teams shook hands.<br>
<br>
"…I'm fine, but I'm definitely gonna be sore tomorrow."<br>
<br>
"Ha-ha, that's because you got a late start on exercising!"<br>
<br>
Amane felt a quiet gratitude toward Itsuki, who was rubbing his sore back even as he<br>
<br>
teased him. He took several deep breaths, and his heart started to calm down.<br>
<br>
His body was burning hot, and it hurt where he had hit the floor, but Amane didn't<br>
<br>
regret playing this hard. He figured that pushing himself from time to time was a good<br>
<br>
thing, even if it wasn't in his nature.<br>
<br>
Amane sucked in one more big breath and decided to go cool off for a bit.<br>
<br>
After gym class was over, Amane changed clothes and washed his face in the locker<br>
<br>
room.<br>
<br>
Lunch period was next, and everyone else headed out as soon as they finished<br>
<br>
changing, complaining about being hungry, so Amane was left with a moment of<br>
<br>
silence.<br>
<br>
He had planned to meet Itsuki and the others in the cafeteria, but he felt awkward<br>
<br>
about facing Mahiru at the moment, so he spent a long time trying to cool his face off<br>
<br>
with the water. He may have gotten carried away, soaking himself all the way up to his<br>
<br>
hair, but he was all damp with sweat anyway, and that was probably exactly what he<br>
<br>
needed to rinse it away.<br>
<br>
I can't believe I fell right in front of her.<br>
<br>
Of all the places he could have fallen, he had done it dramatically, right where Mahiru<br>
<br>
was standing—he remembered her expression when it happened.<br>
<br>
Amane was scowling when he heard quiet footsteps approach from behind.<br>
<br>
"Are you all right?"<br>
<br>
It was a familiar voice, but one he would rather not have heard now. Amane slowly<br>
<br>
stopped splashing his face and looked up.<br>
<br>
He didn't want her to see his pitiful expression, so he bit his lip and took a deep breath.<br>
<br>
Somehow resisting the urge to run away in shame, Amane combed back his wet,<br>
<br>
clinging hair and turned around.<br>
<br>
"What's wrong?" he asked, pretending to be calm. "You're still hanging around here?<br>
<br>
Not eating lunch?"<br>
<br>
He could see that for some reason, Mahiru seemed agitated.<br>
<br>
"Oh, no, it's just… you fell, so I was worried if you were okay… Akazawa told me you<br>
<br>
were here, so—"<br>
<br>
"That Itsuki… You really don't need to worry; I just banged myself up a little bit, that's<br>
<br>
all."<br>
<br>
Mahiru was avoiding making eye contact as she spoke to him, and Amane got the<br>
<br>
feeling that her angel mask was about to peel off, though he wasn't sure why. It was<br>
<br>
perplexing.<br>
<br>
She had appeared upset when he'd taken his fall in front of her, but this seemed to be<br>
<br>
a different sort of agitation.<br>
<br>
He tilted his head quizzically. "Shiina?"<br>
<br>
"…No, it's nothing, so don't worry about it. Also, Fujimiya, that sort of behavior is<br>
<br>
against the rules, so please don't do it again."<br>
<br>
"What are you talking about?"<br>
<br>
"Anyway, it's not allowed."<br>
<br>
Once in a while, Mahiru would say something that Amane just didn't understand, and<br>
<br>
this time, he was especially puzzled. Mahiru cleared her throat without answering his<br>
<br>
question, pulled herself together, and stared straight at Amane.<br>
<br>
"…Earlier, you were protecting us, weren't you?"<br>
<br>
"You just happened to be standing there, that's all. I would have taken the hit even if it<br>
<br>
hadn't been you that was there."<br>
<br>
Earlier, in gym class, the girls had been poking their heads through the net that roughly<br>
<br>
divided the gymnasium, so that they could better cheer on the boys. A stray ball had<br>
<br>
flown perilously close to where the girls had been standing.<br>
<br>
Amane had only fallen because he had just barely managed to block the ball that was<br>
<br>
flying toward the opening in the net.<br>
<br>
Be that as it may, he wanted absolutely no thanks for it, and he would have been<br>
<br>
grateful, though bruised, if she had just let it go.<br>
<br>
"It was nobody's fault but my own, so you can laugh at me if you want."<br>
<br>
"That would be entirely impossible. I'm really grateful. But… that said, I wish you<br>
<br>
wouldn't do such rash things."<br>
<br>
"I couldn't help it."<br>
<br>
Amane looked away as he dried his face with a towel. When he finished, Mahiru was<br>
<br>
looking up at him with an exasperated expression.<br>
<br>
"…You looked cool out there, but once we get home, let me take a good look at where<br>
<br>
you fell, okay Amane?"<br>
<br>
She spoke in a quiet voice that only Amane, standing at this distance, could have heard.<br>
<br>
She sounded insistent, like she wasn't going to let him get away without an<br>
<br>
examination. In response, Amane averted his eyes without agreeing and grumbled,<br>
<br>
"I'll do no such thing."<br>
<br>
Despite his attempts at protesting, when they got home, Mahiru forcibly removed his<br>
<br>
shirt to tend to his injuries.<br>
<br>
After she was done, Amane realized that Mahiru had coerced him into getting half<br>
<br>
naked. He blushed bright red and wasn't able to make eye contact with her for a while.<br>
 <br>
Chapter 50: The Angel Drops a Bomb<br>
<br>
Exams were returned and results announced, and Amane and the other second-year<br>
<br>
students reached a period of relative calm. Club activities resumed, and all they had to<br>
<br>
do was prepare for Sports Day, the next upcoming event, in about three weeks' time.<br>
<br>
Some students, depending on their scores, had to take supplementary lessons, as well<br>
<br>
as supplementary exams for certain subjects. But Amane was in the clear, so during<br>
<br>
this brief period of calm, he spent his time taking it easy.<br>
<br>
Talking with Yuuta after school, Amane got a strained smile from his friend when he<br>
<br>
brought the topic up.<br>
<br>
"I don't actually have much down time, though," Yuuta said. "I've got club activities,<br>
<br>
and I have to practice for the interscholastic athletics competition."<br>
<br>
Yuuta had already become known as the ace of the track and field club in his first year,<br>
<br>
and the coaches and managers had more expectations of him. He never failed to put<br>
<br>
in the effort to live up to those.<br>
<br>
Yuuta had once called Amane "stoic," but from Amane's perspective, that word<br>
<br>
described Yuuta more than him. It was probably exactly that earnest effort that made<br>
<br>
him so popular and well-liked.<br>
<br>
"Oh, that's right, it's still a ways off, but the chance to show off your accomplishments<br>
<br>
is coming up, huh?"<br>
<br>
"Mmm. With the competitions approaching, I'm gonna need to shorten my times more,<br>
<br>
but I don't mind since I like to run anyway."<br>
<br>
"Will you be all right? My image of the track club is that it's pretty demanding."<br>
<br>
"Maybe it is, but it's not like the club is ancient Sparta or anything. The coach knows<br>
<br>
you can't get good results just by going all out every day. There's a balance to it: We<br>
<br>
rest during break times, and when it's time for club activities, we work hard."<br>
<br>
"Huh… sounds like it's definitely an enthusiastic club."<br>
<br>
"I think it does require discipline and motivation, but if it was one of those high-energy<br>
<br>
clubs with no time to rest, I probably would have quit already. If I'm just running, I can<br>
<br>
do that anywhere. That's probably why Shirakawa quit."<br>
<br>
"…Oh yeah, she went to the same middle school as you and Itsuki, right?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, she did. Itsuki and Shirakawa are both so different now compared to back then,<br>
<br>
you'd probably be shocked."<br>
<br>
Now that Yuuta mentioned it, Amane remembered hearing that Chitose's personality<br>
<br>
was quite different than it had been in middle school. He hadn't known any of them at<br>
<br>
that time, so it was difficult for him to imagine.<br>
<br>
The only version of Itsuki and Chitose that he knew was the cheerful couple and<br>
<br>
constant life of the party.<br>
<br>
Their past didn't seem like a topic that they liked to discuss much, so Amane hadn't<br>
<br>
probed deeply, but they must have changed considerably if it was enough for Yuuta to<br>
<br>
mention.<br>
<br>
Amane was curious. But on the other hand, with an expression that said he was<br>
<br>
worried about upsetting Itsuki and Chitose by saying too much, Yuuta related gently,<br>
<br>
"I'm not going to talk about it, but maybe they'll tell you themselves sometime."<br>
<br>
Amane had no intention of forcing the information out of him, so he nodded with<br>
<br>
understanding. Itsuki didn't butt into Amane's personal life, so Amane decided he<br>
<br>
wouldn't go sticking his fingers into his friends' pasts, either.<br>
<br>
"Going back to the topic of track and field, getting too obsessed and running<br>
<br>
mindlessly only leads to injuring your muscles and tendons. For me, you know,<br>
<br>
running track is important, but it's not everything in life. So I'm pretty happy with the<br>
<br>
way the club does it."<br>
<br>
His smile was so dazzling that Amane had to squint to look at him. Looking a little<br>
<br>
embarrassed, Yuuta made an awkward face.<br>
<br>
"Well, that's enough about me, right?" he said. "Let's forget about club activities for<br>
<br>
now; we've got the day off."<br>
<br>
"You're the one who brought it up."<br>
<br>
"That's true, so all the more reason to put a pin in that. Come on, let's go home."<br>
<br>
Amane laughed quietly at Yuuta, who was clearly trying to change the subject, and the<br>
<br>
two of them left the classroom.<br>
<br>
Itsuki and Chitose happened to not have any supplemental lessons that day and had<br>
<br>
apparently left earlier to go on a date. It worked out that club activities were off for<br>
<br>
the day as well, so Amane wanted to seize the chance to hang out with Yuuta. While<br>
<br>
chatting casually after school for a bit, they'd decided to stop somewhere on the way<br>
<br>
back home.<br>
<br>
As they walked down the hallway, Amane spotted a familiar flash of gold farther down<br>
<br>
the hall. He looked again, thinking to himself that it would be unusual for her to still<br>
<br>
be at school, and saw that for some reason, she was holding a large quantity of<br>
<br>
printouts in both arms.<br>
<br>
"…What are you up to, Shiina?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, Fujimiya and Kadowaki! It's unusual to see you still here at this time. Especially<br>
<br>
you, Fujimiya."<br>
<br>
"I could say that right back at you… What's up with those?"<br>
<br>
Amane pointed at the printouts that she was struggling to hold with both hands, and<br>
<br>
gave a small, wry smile.<br>
<br>
"The teachers asked for students who had time to help staple together printouts for<br>
<br>
next month's Sports Day. I couldn't say no… they just gave them to me."<br>
<br>
"…You don't feel like you're being exploited for free labor?"<br>
<br>
For better or worse, the teachers depended on Mahiru as much as the other students.<br>
<br>
Amane had witnessed her getting constantly saddled with odd jobs, and this seemed<br>
<br>
like one of them.<br>
<br>
Mahiru was a prodigy who did well in school and at sports, but she wasn't a member<br>
<br>
of any school clubs, so she was often given work from teachers who thought she had<br>
<br>
an abundance of free time. They probably knew she could never turn down a favor<br>
<br>
due to her kind nature.<br>
<br>
"I do have time to spare, so… I'll be done with this pretty quickly. This is the last bunch<br>
<br>
that I'm taking to an empty classroom, and once I've carried it all over, I just have to<br>
<br>
staple them, and then I'm done."<br>
<br>
"What does the school have secretaries for, then?"<br>
<br>
"Well… it's fine. Despite what it looks like, I'll be done in a little over an hour."<br>
<br>
"But you're talking about voluntarily giving up over an hour of your own time!"<br>
<br>
Amane had some complicated feelings about Mahiru being a model student and<br>
<br>
getting exploited by the teachers in situations like this. But Mahiru either didn't mind<br>
<br>
or was just used to it, so Amane relaxed and gave her a weak smile.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, that's why I wanted to let you know I'm going to be a little late getting home<br>
<br>
today, by about an hour or so. But the sun has been setting later, too, so I'll be fine."<br>
<br>
Mahiru said this like it was nothing, and Amane sighed softly.<br>
<br>
"…Sorry, Kadowaki, could we push today's hangout to another day?'<br>
<br>
"What a coincidence, I was just thinking that."<br>
<br>
It seemed the two had been thinking the same thing.<br>
<br>
Amane and Yuuta looked at each other and smiled, then casually grabbed the printouts<br>
<br>
from Mahiru's hands.<br>
<br>
Mahiru must not have been expecting it. She blinked several times, stunned, and<br>
<br>
seemed to take a minute to understand what had happened. Then, she grabbed<br>
<br>
Amane's sleeve in a panic.<br>
<br>
"F-Fujimiya, give those back!"<br>
<br>
"Where are you taking them?" Amane asked.<br>
<br>
"Umm, to an open classroom on the second floor… but that's not the point!" she<br>
<br>
insisted. "I was asked to do this."<br>
<br>
"It's not like they have anything confidential written on them, since they gave them to<br>
<br>
a student," he said. "And anyway, they didn't say you couldn't have help, did they?"<br>
<br>
"Th-that's true, but… say something, please, Kadowaki!"<br>
<br>
"Ah-ha-ha! Fujimiya, you can't do that," Yuuta mock-scolded. "You have to let me carry<br>
<br>
half."<br>
<br>
"Here ya go."<br>
<br>
Smiling at Mahiru's grumpy look, Amane handed half of the papers to Kadowaki.<br>
<br>
Mahiru seemed to realize that it was pointless to protest any further.<br>
<br>
Amane could feel her reproachful eyes on him but let her gaze slide right off as he<br>
<br>
headed for the classroom she had indicated.<br>
<br>
"…I didn't mean to steal your time from you," Mahiru muttered.<br>
<br>
"Nobody's stealing my time. I'm using it as I please."<br>
<br>
Amane was doing it completely voluntarily. There was an argument to be made that<br>
<br>
he felt compelled to do her this favor, but it was better than Mahiru toiling away alone.<br>
<br>
Yuuta was smiling calmly and seemed to agree, so she ultimately gave up on saying<br>
<br>
anything else. She glared at Amane with a tiny bit of resentment, which he pretended<br>
<br>
not to notice.<br>
<br>
Despite it all, Mahiru didn't stop them. He figured she probably just didn't know how<br>
<br>
to respond to the favor.<br>
<br>
"…You dummy."<br>
<br>
She insulted him outright in an adorable way that he had never seen her do at school<br>
<br>
before. Both Amane and Yuuta burst into laughter.<br>
<br>
Mahiru, whose angel mask had slipped off a little bit, narrowed her eyes as she walked<br>
<br>
beside the boys—<br>
<br>
"So not only does she curry favor with the teachers, she's flirting with boys, too. All<br>
<br>
while telling us that she's got an 'important person' or whatever."<br>
<br>
"Seriously. She's such a suck-up."<br>
<br>
Amane heard voices from somewhere, and he felt his body stiffen as he walked. He<br>
<br>
glanced around but couldn't see any girls who might have been the voices' owners. He<br>
<br>
decided they were probably somewhere behind him.<br>
<br>
Beside him, Yuuta's smile didn't change, but the look in his eyes was serious. Amane<br>
<br>
remembered him confessing once that he absolutely hated people who spread gossip,<br>
<br>
so it didn't seem like he would be able to forgive what they just heard.<br>
<br>
Even Amane was on the verge of saying something, but he knew that would just make<br>
<br>
things worse, so he kept his mouth shut and peered over at Mahiru.<br>
<br>
Mahiru didn't seem to think anything of it and had on her usual calm expression, as if<br>
<br>
she was accustomed to such treatment.<br>
<br>
That expression made him uneasy, and without meaning to, he found himself staring<br>
<br>
at Mahiru. She must have noticed, because she put on a gentle smile and said, "Thank<br>
<br>
you ever so much for helping me. Let's finish this up before it gets too late, shall we?"<br>
<br>
Her voice was calm and collected, and both Amane and Yuuta nodded, unable to say<br>
<br>
anything further.<br>
<br>
The three of them worked in awkward silence, and once they had finished the job,<br>
<br>
Mahiru left for home first. After waiting a while to stagger their times, Amane headed<br>
<br>
back as well.<br>
<br>
When he returned to his apartment, he took a long look at Mahiru's face.<br>
<br>
Her expression was the same as always, and no sign of hurt or anger darkened her<br>
<br>
beautiful face. Instead, it was Amane who felt irritated as he recalled those girls'<br>
<br>
words.<br>
<br>
Mahiru noticed the sour look on Amane's face, and she quickly gave him a bitter smile.<br>
<br>
"Are you perhaps worrying about what happened at school earlier?"<br>
<br>
"…It's bothering me."<br>
<br>
Of course, he was going to get angry at people who wouldn't say anything to her face<br>
<br>
but snuck around in the shadows bad-mouthing her.<br>
<br>
Amane sat down beside Mahiru and took another long look at her; she was smiling at<br>
<br>
his behavior like she always did.<br>
<br>
"That kind of stuff doesn't bother me so much. I expect that degree of gossip, actually;<br>
<br>
it would be stranger not to hear it."<br>
<br>
Amane was the only one who was bothered by it and by Mahiru's total, nonchalant<br>
<br>
acceptance of the idea that some people hated her.<br>
<br>
He knew the reason why Mahiru conducted herself as an angel, so it was surprising<br>
<br>
that it didn't upset her, and his awkward expression showed it.<br>
<br>
"I-is that really how it is?"<br>
<br>
"It's only natural, right? It's not like everyone is going to like me, you know. It would<br>
<br>
be kind of scary if a person like that existed," Mahiru said quietly and dispassionately,<br>
<br>
twirling a piece of hair around her fingertip as if she was bored.<br>
<br>
"I think that I make it easy for people to like me," she continued, "but I doubt that<br>
<br>
works for every single person in school. It's just that all the kind voices are usually<br>
<br>
louder and easier to hear. The supportive voices of kind people just help block out the<br>
<br>
hate. I mean, even you didn't like me that much at first, I think."<br>
<br>
"…It truly pains me to hear you say that, but…"<br>
<br>
Sure, before he had gotten to know Mahiru, when he had only known her by her<br>
<br>
reputation, Amane had thought of her as someone who excelled in everything and was<br>
<br>
beautiful. He knew that she was desirable due to those traits.<br>
<br>
But he would say he fell into the category of people who didn't particularly care much<br>
<br>
for the angel, at least not on a personal level. When everything about her had seemed<br>
<br>
too perfect, he'd found her almost unapproachable.<br>
<br>
"Especially among the girls," Mahiru said, "there are people who act friendly on the<br>
<br>
surface, when they actually hate me. Since so many people admire me, they bad-mouth<br>
<br>
me to mask their own insecurities. I just try to get along with as many people as I can.<br>
<br>
It makes everything easier, you see."<br>
<br>
Mahiru matter-of-factly evaluated her position relative to the people who hated her.<br>
<br>
Amane wasn't sure what he could possibly say in response.<br>
<br>
He figured that girls and boys must live in different worlds, with different rules for<br>
<br>
human interactions. If Mahiru was telling him this, it probably meant that there were<br>
<br>
people out there who shunned her, and she had really heard them say such things<br>
<br>
before.<br>
<br>
He wasn't able to come up with the right words and couldn't do anything but sit there<br>
<br>
uneasily. Mahiru must have noticed, because she relaxed into a smile.<br>
<br>
"There are way fewer of them now, but there have always been a certain percentage<br>
<br>
of people who hate me, so I'm used to it. I'm careful to conduct myself in a way that<br>
<br>
reduces that number as much as possible, but it will never be zero. There are some<br>
<br>
people who detest me because the majority likes me."<br>
<br>
"…Isn't that painful?"<br>
<br>
"Well, I'm sure I wouldn't like it very much if anyone ever said it to my face, but to date,<br>
<br>
no one has made such a declaration. Besides, I'm sure that people like the ones today<br>
<br>
who say they hate me aren't talking about the real me; they just resent my outward<br>
<br>
appearance and social standing. There's not really anything I can do about that, so I<br>
<br>
don't plan to try."<br>
<br>
"That's very pragmatic…"<br>
<br>
"If I wasn't pragmatic about it, I wouldn't be able to stand acting the way I do at school."<br>
<br>
Mahiru, who was more disciplined than anyone Amane knew, had a quiet, thoughtful<br>
<br>
look in her eyes. A small sigh escaped her lips.<br>
<br>
"I am aware that, objectively, I have more attractive features than many other people,"<br>
<br>
she said. "Some of it is genetic, but I also put a lot of work into my appearance. There<br>
<br>
are people who find me superficial just because I value that."<br>
<br>
Her words weren't an exaggeration or presumptuous in any way; they were the<br>
<br>
foundation for her self-confidence.<br>
<br>
Certainly, Amane was not about to deny her natural beauty, especially having seen her<br>
<br>
mother, who she took after.<br>
<br>
But Mahiru's charms didn't lie in the features she had inherited.<br>
<br>
Her demeanor and conduct, the way she wielded her gaze and her expressions, the<br>
<br>
very atmosphere that surrounded her… she had not been born with any of those<br>
<br>
things, but they were what made her truly lovely. Amane thought that her remarkable<br>
<br>
intelligence and personal character were more beautiful than even her outward 1<br>
<br>
appearance.<br>
<br>
…Still, she is very pretty… 1<br>
<br>
Mahiru's willpower was so brilliant, it seemed like he would be burned by the<br>
<br>
radiance. Mahiru herself seemed like she also might be scorched by that light, and it<br>
<br>
was a little scary.<br>
<br>
"I put a lot of effort into things you can't see on the surface, you know. That's why some<br>
<br>
people who can only see the end result assume that I must be cheating somehow. And<br>
<br>
their feelings of envy aren't my responsibility. Of course, if I was able to correct one<br>
<br>
thing, I think it would be the way people talk about me and Kadowaki. We get along<br>
<br>
well, but there's absolutely nothing romantic going on between us. People<br>
<br>
misunderstand that and get jealous, which is bothersome."<br>
<br>
"I… I see…"<br>
<br>
"I mean, have I ever behaved like I was into him? I think he's a considerate and likeable<br>
<br>
guy, but I don't have any romantic feelings toward him at all. But people start<br>
<br>
speculating if I so much as talk to him, and it's annoying."<br>
<br>
What seemed to really bother her was the sheer frequency of the rumors.<br>
<br>
Mahiru and Yuuta, who had been transformed into idols of sorts by their schoolmates,<br>
<br>
were often paired up in people's minds, since they were both role models to their<br>
<br>
respective sexes.<br>
<br>
In reality, they barely interacted. When Mahiru had made Amane's acquaintance, she<br>
<br>
at best knew of Yuuta as a popular guy on campus but hadn't known him personally.<br>
<br>
They only became friends when Amane started hanging out with him.<br>
<br>
Amane had never suspected that Mahiru had any romantic feelings toward Yuuta. She<br>
<br>
had always treated the "prince" of the school with impartiality.<br>
<br>
"Maybe to the girls crushing on Kadowaki, it looks like he's already taken," Amane said.<br>
<br>
"Most guys, if you approached them, Mahiru, would go crazy for you."<br>
<br>
"Hmm, it doesn't seem like you're in that group, Amane."<br>
<br>
"…Well…"<br>
<br>
He was already completely infatuated, no approach necessary. He felt like nothing she 1<br>
<br>
did would change how deep his feelings of love for her were, but he couldn't tell her<br>
<br>
that.<br>
<br>
Amane glanced nervously about as he tried to come up with a response, but Mahiru<br>
<br>
was staring directly at him.<br>
<br>
He couldn't stand the pressure, so he looked away from her, but he saw her sigh from<br>
<br>
out of the corner of his eye.<br>
<br>
"At any rate, Kadowaki isn't my type. Objectively, he is very handsome, and quite the<br>
<br>
well-mannered gentleman, too, but… how do I put this…? In some ways, our situations<br>
<br>
are similar, so I'm happy to have him as an acquaintance or friend, maybe even as<br>
<br>
someone I can look to for support. But I don't feel like any of that is leading toward us<br>
<br>
falling in love."<br>
<br>
"…I guess when you think about it, you and Kadowaki do have some things in<br>
<br>
common," Amane agreed. "Though there's not such a big difference between his public<br>
<br>
and private self as there is between yours."<br>
<br>
This was something that Amane had come to understand recently as he'd gotten to<br>
<br>
know Yuuta better. Like her, Yuuta also tended to try to act the way that everybody<br>
<br>
expected him to. However, it wasn't as obvious as when Mahiru did it, and he usually<br>
<br>
let some of his real personality show through.<br>
<br>
Mahiru had no choice but to act the way she did because of her family background.<br>
<br>
The reason she did it and the degree to which she had to maintain the act were<br>
<br>
different, so they were similar but not the same.<br>
<br>
"You make it sound like I have a split personality… A-are my public and private selves<br>
<br>
really that different?"<br>
<br>
"They are, but how can I put this… Your true self is much cuter than your angel<br>
<br>
persona. At first, well, you seemed cool and serious, but once I got to know you, I found<br>
<br>
you to be an honest person who's much shier than I expected. The way you express<br>
<br>
emotions with your words and actions is completely different, too, so… yeah, there's<br>
<br>
a difference, you know?"<br>
<br>
"Wh-who exactly do you think is making me act like this?"<br>
<br>
"…That's, well, hmm. It's not on purpose."<br>
<br>
It wasn't that he was doing it intentionally. It was just that Mahiru got embarrassed<br>
<br>
easily whenever someone gave her an honest compliment.<br>
<br>
Amane understood perfectly well that she had always been a hard worker and very<br>
<br>
disciplined, so he had been trying to give her frank, genuine praise as often as he could.<br>
<br>
If that brought out her bashful side, well, it was too late to do anything about that.<br>
<br>
"I think it's even more wicked of you to do it not on purpose, though."<br>
<br>
"You could say the same thing about yourself. You're the heartless one, Mahiru."<br>
<br>
"What is that supposed to mean?"<br>
<br>
"…In your case, you've been getting more and more touchy, and it's hard to deal with."<br>
<br>
Mahiru especially had no room to criticize Amane. She had a talent for making people<br>
<br>
blush and used it quite often. To make matters worse, she often carried out surprise<br>
<br>
attacks, forcing Amane into difficult tests of willpower on a daily basis.<br>
<br>
At the word "touchy," Mahiru's large eyes opened even wider, and she blinked several<br>
<br>
times. Then she gasped, and her lip started trembling.<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't help but notice a deep red slowly staining her cheeks.<br>
<br>
"I-it's not on purpose." Once she'd reached a lovely shade of cherry, Mahiru offered<br>
<br>
this excuse in a wavering voice. "There are times when I do touch you on purpose, but<br>
<br>
I never meant to make you uncomfortable."<br>
<br>
"I have several questions about your definition of 'on purpose,' but I know that you<br>
<br>
didn't really mean anything by it. You should just be careful, though, because if a girl<br>
<br>
does stuff like that too often, someone could get the wrong idea."<br>
<br>
"…I only do it with you."<br>
<br>
"I know that, too. That's why I'm telling you."<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't be certain what kind of feelings Mahiru had toward him, but he knew<br>
<br>
she thought he was special, and that she liked him.<br>
<br>
Still, he was a guy, and her thoughtless contact often troubled him. He thought he'd<br>
<br>
appreciate it if she toned it down a little, for his sanity's sake if nothing else.<br>
<br>
When he looked in Mahiru's direction, Amane noticed that her face was still very red.<br>
<br>
Mahiru smacked his upper arm playfully.<br>
<br>
"See? That's what I'm talking about," he protested.<br>
<br>
"That time was on purpose."<br>
<br>
"Okay…"<br>
<br>
Mahiru gave Amane a bit of a scowl. He didn't understand what he'd done wrong. Even<br>
<br>
though she was glaring at him, the expression on her face and the embarrassment in<br>
<br>
her eyes made her look nothing if not adorable.<br>
<br>
Amane got the feeling that if he told her she looked more cute than scary, she'd<br>
<br>
probably be even angrier.<br>
<br>
So, he didn't say anything at all, and Mahiru cleared her throat and straightened up.<br>
<br>
"Anyway, back to what we were talking about earlier," she said. "It doesn't really bother<br>
<br>
me that some girls hate me. It's a childish dream to think that everyone will always get<br>
<br>
along, after all, and I know it'd only cause more problems trying to force it, so I've<br>
<br>
accepted that certain people just won't like me."<br>
<br>
"…Mm-hmm."<br>
<br>
"This contradicts what I was saying earlier, but after pretending to be nice and acting<br>
<br>
the part of the angel that everyone adores for so long, recently I've started to think<br>
<br>
that maybe I've had enough."<br>
<br>
"Really?"<br>
<br>
Amane never expected to hear those words from Mahiru, who maintained her angelic<br>
<br>
persona with such tireless consistency, and he thoughtlessly repeated her words back<br>
<br>
to her.<br>
<br>
Mahiru smiled faintly. "I've been thinking, maybe I don't need to be such a good girl…<br>
<br>
I've always tried to keep up an act so that everyone will like me, even though I knew it<br>
<br>
wouldn't work on everyone. But if I had someone who could discover the real me, and<br>
<br>
really see me for who I am, I could be happy just being myself, I think."<br>
<br>
Mahiru's eyes wavered with a certain lonesomeness as she thought back on her past<br>
<br>
self, and soon her caramel-coloured eyes shone brightly.<br>
<br>
"You said you wouldn't take your eyes off me, right, Amane?"<br>
<br>
Anyone could have seen that the light contained joyful hope for the future. It wasn't<br>
<br>
sparklingly radiant, but gentle and kind, the sort that had real warmth and affection<br>
<br>
in it.<br>
<br>
As she gave him a look filled with such brightness and emotion, Amane gulped loudly.<br>
<br>
"…I made a promise, so…"<br>
<br>
"Yes, you did."<br>
<br>
Mahiru's face melted into a broad smile at Amane's affirmation. Her expression<br>
<br>
seemed dazzling and vibrant, different from the calm in her eyes, and he found that he<br>
<br>
couldn't look away from her.<br>
<br>
As though from somewhere far away, Amane felt his heart pounding hard as he tried<br>
<br>
to sear the image of her smile into his memory.<br>
<br>
"So that's why I don't have to get too worked up about anything. I'm not going to go<br>
<br>
out of my way to change how I act at school, and I'm not going to worry too much<br>
<br>
about it, either. It's all right, because I've got someone who sees me for who I am and<br>
<br>
accepts me."<br>
<br>
"…I see."<br>
<br>
Because Amane had discovered the real Mahiru who had been huddled up inside, and<br>
<br>
he was looking at her for who she was.<br>
<br>
That was what let her stay calm.<br>
<br>
Overwhelming feelings of joy and love welled up inside him, tickling his chest.<br>
<br>
But a small lump also formed there, blocking that feeling just a little bit.<br>
<br>
"…You look sort of dissatisfied, don't you?"<br>
<br>
Mahiru had noticed that something was bothering Amane and turned to him with a<br>
<br>
troubled, anxious look on her face. He couldn't say for sure that it was dissatisfaction<br>
<br>
he was feeling, though.<br>
<br>
"N-no, it makes me happy that you've started feeling that way. I think it's a great thing.<br>
<br>
But it's just, well, I've just… got some thoughts."<br>
<br>
"What is it? Tell me now."<br>
<br>
"Ah, no, it's—"<br>
<br>
"I'm not going to get mad or anything! I can't even imagine you saying anything to hurt<br>
<br>
me."<br>
<br>
The pressure of her eyes staring directly at him was enough to tell him he wouldn't<br>
<br>
have the chance to refuse.<br>
<br>
After all, Amane had also said some things that could be misinterpreted, and knew he<br>
<br>
should explain himself, but—<br>
<br>
He also believed that if he put what he was feeling into words, he might be setting<br>
<br>
himself up to be teased for his immature emotions.<br>
<br>
"Fine. D-don't laugh, okay?"<br>
<br>
There was no way that he was going to get out of telling her, so he tried to warn her<br>
<br>
first, and she nodded obediently. He found it unbearable to look at her directly, so<br>
<br>
Amane averted his eyes somewhat from Mahiru and opened his mouth to continue.<br>
<br>
"Now, you said you wouldn't get worked up…"<br>
<br>
"Right," she answered.<br>
<br>
"The thing is, sometimes you let your guard down and show your real self without<br>
<br>
meaning to…" He made it that far, then hesitated to say any more, but it was too late to<br>
<br>
stop, so Amane took a deep breath. His lip quivered as he carried on. "…And when I<br>
<br>
think about another guy seeing you like that… I dunno, it makes me feel… conflicted."<br>
<br>
He paused for a moment before reaching the conclusion of that thought, because he<br>
<br>
knew right away how childish he sounded.<br>
<br>
He was glad that Mahiru had accepted herself and was starting to change the way she<br>
<br>
thought about things, and he was happy that she had extended a hand to him, after<br>
<br>
spending many years wearing the same protective shell.<br>
<br>
He was also happy that she had placed her wholehearted trust in him.<br>
<br>
And he was overjoyed that she seemed to be coming to feel that she could be herself,<br>
<br>
without keeping up false appearances.<br>
<br>
He should have had no complaints, and yet he hated the idea of Mahiru—this<br>
<br>
completely ordinary, sensitive girl, who always worked hard despite difficult<br>
<br>
circumstances, who got lonely with surprising ease and was bad at depending on<br>
<br>
others because she tended to put on a show of courage—he hated the idea of all the<br>
<br>
other students at school getting to see that girl.<br>
<br>
I know that it's just possessiveness and jealousy making me feel like this.<br>
<br>
But that was what he truly felt, despite knowing that she didn't belong to him and that<br>
<br>
he had no right to feel the way he did.<br>
<br>
"L-look, I know that this sounds presumptuous, and that you'll probably want to tell<br>
<br>
me off, but—"<br>
<br>
Amane pursed his lips in self-derision, marveling at how shamefully pathetic he must<br>
<br>
be. Mahiru looked at him, blinking her round, cute eyes in surprise, clearly taken<br>
<br>
aback. Gradually, both corners of her lips started to curve upward.<br>
<br>
By the time Amane noticed, she was already grinning, and her demeanor had changed<br>
<br>
to something warm and cheerful.<br>
<br>
"I—I thought I told you not to laugh!"<br>
<br>
"Heh-heh, sorry!"<br>
<br>
When Mahiru apologized with a wide, defenseless, cherubic smile completely free of<br>
<br>
any ill will, it was all Amane could do to catch his breath. He couldn't offer any further<br>
<br>
complaints.<br>
<br>
It was a different type from the one she'd been wearing before, an expression in her<br>
<br>
eyes of pure joy and affection that surpassed anything he had seen. It left Amane<br>
<br>
speechless.<br>
<br>
Mahiru let her smile drop just a little bit and fixed her eyes on Amane again. "…You<br>
<br>
don't have to worry, Amane, I'm not going to show anyone else the kind of faces I show<br>
<br>
you. There's no way I would feel comfortable enough with people I'm not close with."<br>
<br>
"I—I see."<br>
<br>
Amane was understandably relieved and became keenly aware that his emotions were<br>
<br>
plainly visible on his face.<br>
<br>
Usually, he was better at hiding his feelings, but when it came to Mahiru, no matter<br>
<br>
what he did, the things he tried to conceal showed up on the surface.<br>
<br>
"…You're such a cutie, Amane," Mahiru said, while smiling like something was funny.<br>
<br>
Amane bit the inside of his cheek and squeezed, keeping his facial muscles locked in<br>
<br>
place. "Stop that. You're making fun of me, aren't you?"<br>
<br>
"I mean it," she insisted.<br>
<br>
"That's uncalled for; quit it."<br>
<br>
"You quit it, stop showing me such a cute side of you."<br>
<br>
"I'm going to have to challenge that. I mean, what about me could possibly be<br>
<br>
considered cute? And why would you say that to a guy?"<br>
<br>
As someone who prided himself on shedding all his adorable traits, Amane didn't have<br>
<br>
a clue what she meant.<br>
<br>
Women and children could accept the word as a compliment, but Amane was a guy<br>
<br>
and had no desire to be cute, so he could only take it as simple teasing.<br>
<br>
He frowned and protested with his eyes, but Mahiru let out a little giggle that told him<br>
<br>
her evaluation wasn't going to waver.<br>
<br>
"Everything about you is endearing."<br>
<br>
"I can't trust it when a girl says that, and I don't agree."<br>
<br>
"What an awful thing to say. Well, you have to understand the fact that a girl's<br>
<br>
definition of cute isn't just based on appearances but is more a sign of whether she<br>
<br>
finds something likable in a broader sense… That's why you're definitely cute,<br>
<br>
Amane!"<br>
<br>
"Guys aren't happy about being called that, you know."<br>
<br>
He did not appreciate the girl he liked choosing this way to compliment him.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, he was happy about the fact that she was praising him, but Amane would<br>
<br>
never call a guy like himself adorable.<br>
<br>
He thought about asking her why she thought he'd be happy that she called him cute,<br>
<br>
but he got the feeling that she hadn't been trying to compliment him specifically so<br>
<br>
much as just to state her own opinion, so there didn't seem to be any point.<br>
<br>
Amane pressed his lips together tightly and looked at Mahiru, but she was still smiling<br>
<br>
joyously. If he hadn't been able to see the affection in her eyes, he probably would have<br>
<br>
pinched her cheeks right then.<br>
<br>
"…Is there nothing attractive about me?" Amane grumbled quietly, without meaning<br>
<br>
to.<br>
<br>
Mahiru stiffened up and fixed her eyes on him, which made him immediately regret<br>
<br>
his words.<br>
<br>
Even for a pitiful loser like Amane, begging for compliments was too much. Anyway,<br>
<br>
there was no chance that Mahiru thought of him as someone who was cool when he<br>
<br>
had been told by plenty of other people that he was a lazy, pathetic late bloomer.<br>
<br>
Amane averted his eyes, concluding that it was a mistake to even expect such words<br>
<br>
from her. But Mahiru did not look away.<br>
<br>
"You are attractive."<br>
<br>
Amane couldn't believe his ears when he heard these clearly enunciated words.<br>
<br>
"To be honest, you are cute, but you're also cool. More than anyone else, in my eyes."<br>
<br>
"…You don't have to force yourself to flatter me."<br>
<br>
"How rude. What would I get out of lying to you? I'm just saying what I think."<br>
<br>
"…You're overstating it, and you have no taste in men."<br>
<br>
Amane was working on becoming a better version of himself, but he didn't think he<br>
<br>
was especially desirable. So even when Mahiru praised him, he couldn't let himself<br>
<br>
believe her. Especially after she went on and on about how he was cute.<br>
<br>
"So what is your definition of 'cool,' Amane?"<br>
<br>
Amane was frowning, and Mahiru gently gazed at him.<br>
<br>
"For me, I think to view a guy as charming, you need to take everything about his<br>
<br>
personality into account, from the aura around him, to how he carries himself, to his<br>
<br>
words, actions, and expressions. Thinking that attractiveness is only a matter of<br>
<br>
appearance seems very superficial to me."<br>
<br>
"W-well, that's true, but—"<br>
<br>
"Looking at you objectively, I wouldn't say you're handsome enough to captivate<br>
<br>
everyone who looks at you. But your face is well-proportioned, and like I said before,<br>
<br>
appearances aren't the only thing that make someone appealing. You're maybe a little<br>
<br>
sarcastic, but you're always polite, and you're well-mannered and gentlemanly and<br>
<br>
kind. You're always reaching out to those in need even though you put on a show of<br>
<br>
being cold and distant. You're cautious, but you're dependable when you need to be.<br>
<br>
Looking at you all together, you are attractive, Amane. Of course, I can't deny that my<br>
<br>
subjective opinion and personal preferences factor into that assessment, but you're<br>
<br>
very cool, so please have a little more confidence."<br>
<br>
"Th-that's enough, I get it, I hear you, so—"<br>
<br>
"You don't get it. You don't have any self-confidence, so if I don't get serious and tell<br>
<br>
you—"<br>
<br>
"I said that's enough!"<br>
<br>
Mahiru had gotten more insistent as she spoke, and before she even finished, Amane<br>
<br>
had found himself groaning with embarrassment. If Mahiru flattered him any further,<br>
<br>
he felt like he would burst into tears of shame, so he had to do something to stop her<br>
<br>
from continuing to list his various merits. He took a deep breath to try to somehow<br>
<br>
calm his heart, which was sending heat radiating up to his face, as if he wasn't<br>
<br>
embarrassed enough already. He felt like his cheeks probably looked as red as ripe<br>
<br>
apples, and that even Mahiru, who had just been praising him, would find it pathetic.<br>
<br>
The fact that Mahiru held Amane in high regard had somehow sunk in—it was clear<br>
<br>
to him, so he didn't need her to continue in any more detail. Her compliments only<br>
<br>
made him heartsick. He felt such joy and shame at the idea that she valued him at all<br>
<br>
that he couldn't stand to be there any longer. He wanted to run away.<br>
<br>
Amane's eyes darted around as he desperately tried to shake off the heat and<br>
<br>
humiliation that had overtaken his body.<br>
<br>
Mahiru looked at him and smiled broadly, obviously delighted. "…That is what's so cute<br>
<br>
about you, Amane."<br>
<br>
It was a little late, but Amane finally understood what Mahiru was trying to say. He<br>
<br>
glared at her; his face still flushed red.<br>
<br>
"If you try to say anything more, I'll have to stop you somehow."<br>
<br>
"…Oh, and how will you do that?"<br>
<br>
"What do you mean, how? I'll manage, I'm sure."<br>
<br>
"Well, you don't scare me one bit."<br>
<br>
Mahiru didn't look like she was going to restrain herself. Still smiling, she gently<br>
<br>
reached out toward Amane's face.<br>
<br>
He could feel Mahiru's chilly fingers pressingagainst his feverish cheeks. Gently, she<br>
<br>
turned his face so that he was looking directly at her.<br>
<br>
"…No matter what you say, even if you don't think it's true, to me, you are attractive,<br>
<br>
Amane. You don't have to worry about it; I can see all the best parts of you."<br>
<br>
She was very close to him, and her voice was bright like the rays of the spring sun,<br>
<br>
refreshing and clear. Her words slowly caressed his heart as she softly praised him.<br>
<br>
The warmth and affection in her caramel-coloured eyes took his breath away, as they<br>
<br>
reflected him and him alone.<br>
<br>
…I can't…<br>
<br>
Amane felt a heat that he'd never experienced before. He couldn't so much as manage<br>
<br>
a groan, or even to avert his eyes. He just stood there, basking in Mahiru's radiance.<br>
<br>
Then, suddenly, Mahiru's smile changed to something much softer.<br>
<br>
"You're adorable." 2<br>
<br>
The moment he heard her sweetly whisper, a pleasant tingle ran up his spine, and the<br>
<br>
warmth heating Amane's whole body grew even stronger under Mahiru's gaze.<br>
<br>
Before he realized it, he had grasped her delicate fingers and taken them off his cheek,<br>
<br>
and in a single, smooth movement, had pressed Mahiru against the back of the couch,<br>
<br>
bringing his face very close to hers.<br>
<br>
There was only a palm's breadth of distance between them.<br>
<br>
Amane had kept his word, closing Mahiru's mouth shut with his hand against her lips<br>
<br>
as he stared down at her.<br>
<br>
The caramel-coloured eyes peeking through long eyelashes that almost looked like a<br>
<br>
hazy curtain were open wide in surprise.<br>
<br>
That was close, Amane thought.<br>
<br>
If she had looked at him with those eyes, if she had stirred him up any further, he might<br>
<br>
have lost all restraint for a moment. If he didn't exert the small amount of self-control<br>
<br>
he had in order to stop her, they both would have given up their first kiss.<br>
<br>
As much as he would have liked to keep going and gradually chip away at those "firsts,"<br>
<br>
Amane was brought back to reality by the urgent alarm bells of reason ringing in his<br>
<br>
head. He was grateful that he had chosen a course of action that he wouldn't regret<br>
<br>
later.<br>
<br>
Mahiru, who had been calm and collected until a moment prior, stiffened when he<br>
<br>
touched her lips, and a light crimson color spread over her cheeks in an instant.<br>
<br>
Amane smirked when he saw that she hadn't gotten any better at dealing with sudden<br>
<br>
surprises. Slowly, he lifted his hand from her lips.<br>
<br>
They were still close enough that if he'd wiggled his fingers a little, they'd have<br>
<br>
brushed her face, but instead of pulling back a little, he slowly put his lips near her ear<br>
<br>
and whispered, "…If you say something like that again, I'll pull my hand away, and<br>
<br>
really shut your mouth." 2<br>
<br>
Though he couldn't see her face, Amane could feel Mahiru shudder.<br>
<br>
However, she didn't push him away or try to block him. Feeling relieved, Amane<br>
<br>
gradually backed away. He was suddenly embarrassed at how much he wanted to see<br>
<br>
Mahiru's face, and he guiltily looked away.<br>
<br>
In fact, he was already feeling intensely ashamed over his sudden, reckless boldness,<br>
<br>
and he moved to rise from the sofa. He knew that he wasn't thinking straight, and that<br>
<br>
what he needed was to get some actual, physical distance from her for a moment.<br>
<br>
But when he started to stand, he felt some resistance. He looked down to where he felt<br>
<br>
something pulling on him, then the next moment, a sweet smell filled his nose.<br>
<br>
In the blink of an eye, threads of shimmering gold danced past him, and he felt<br>
<br>
something soft graze one of his still-flushed cheeks.<br>
<br>
Then he heard the sound of slippers on the floor and the echo of footsteps that were<br>
<br>
wilder and more restless than they were nimble. Mahiru was gone, and it was like<br>
<br>
everything he had just felt had been an illusion.<br>
<br>
He recognized the bang of his front door slamming shut, and Amane brought his hand<br>
<br>
to the cheek where something soft had touched it. 2<br>
<br>
"—Why?" he mumbled, but naturally there was no answer.<br>
<br>
Sapped of all energy, spirit, and composure, Amane sunk down into the sofa and stared<br>
<br>
down the hallway where the flaxen whirlwind had disappeared.<br>
<br>
Mahiru did not return to Amane's apartment for the rest of the day<br>
