    2 A Cold–and Being Nursed by an Angel<p></p>
    "Amane, your sniffling's annoying."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're annoying."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The next day, it was Amane who'd ended up with the cold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As his classmate and good friend Itsuki Akazawa had pointed out, Amane had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    trying and failing to snort everything back up his nose. Trying to exhale only resulted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in a terrible, wet, burbling sound.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't sure whether it was because his nose was stuffed up or as a result of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the cold itself, but a throbbing pain was spreading across the back of his head. He had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    taken some over-the-counter medicine, but it wasn't making a dent in his symptoms<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at all. Truly, Amane was a sad sight. His congested face twisted in nasal distress as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    became well acquainted with a tissue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki looked at him, not with concern but exasperation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You were just fine yesterday, dude."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I got caught in the rain."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Aw, chin up. Wait, didn't you have an umbrella yesterday?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I gave it to someone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Naturally, there was no way that Amane could openly admit at school that he'd given<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it to Mahiru, so he kept things vague.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Incidentally, he'd caught a glimpse of Mahiru earlier that day. She'd looked rather well,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not ill at all. Amane couldn't help but laugh. Things had gotten completely flipped around.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was his own fault—he'd neglected to warm up in the bath when he'd gotten home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don'cha think you were being a little too nice, lending out your umbrella when it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pouring like that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not really. Even if I did, no point complaining about it now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And who did you give it to anyway? Who was worth catching a cold?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…A, uh, a lost little kid?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Can't really call her a kid with that body, though… Well, that and the fact that we're the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    same age. Although, her face did look kinda lost…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something clicked when Amane thought of the unusual encounter that way. Her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression had been exactly that of a lost little kid searching for their parent.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, what a kind and upstanding gentleman you are!" Itsuki laughed, unaware of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feelings bubbling up in Amane's chest as he recalled his meeting with Mahiru the day<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before. "But you know, even if you let someone borrow your umbrella or whatever, I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bet your real problem was that you got lazy and didn't warm up afterward. That's why<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you're dying."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…How do you know that?" Amane shot back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you don't exactly take good care of yourself. That much was obvious the moment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I saw your place. That's why you got sick, dumbass."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't really argue with Itsuki's friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and his room was always a total mess. What's more, he subsisted on a diet of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with him, asking him how he could live like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    caught a cold overnight.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow's Saturday, so focus on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    getting better," Itsuki advised.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I will…," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do." Itsuki's lips curled up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at his slight boast.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up. I don't need to hear that from a guy who's already got a girlfriend." Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    irritated.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As the day wore on, Amane's condition continued to deteriorate.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rougher than usual, and he felt hot.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he'd let his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not a concern, was now a source of dull agony.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane's floor, he staggered out on leaden<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    complexion vibrant and glowing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before, neatly folded and closed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn't have to, Amane reasoned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Really, you don't need to give it back," he said aloud.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's only natural to return something you borrowed…" Mahiru hesitated as soon as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she got a good look at Amane's face. "Um. You have a fever, don't you…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's got nothing to do with you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru—and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn't have been worth<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out how Amane had caught a cold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in the rain."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I said it's fine, really. It's not something you need to worry about."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    From Amane's perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self-satisfaction, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he didn't want her fussing over him now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, Mahiru didn't seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her graceful features.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…So yeah, it's all good. See ya." Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru's questioning and concern.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength<p></p>
    <p></p>
    left his body.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wouldn't break, and he wouldn't fall. Surely it would catch him, and he'd be fine.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there's no avoiding it…, Amane thought,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    resigning himself to the pain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Just as I thought; I can't leave you alone like this." Amane heard a fragile voice through<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his feverish haze. "I'll repay your favor."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    opened the door to his apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm going to help you inside. There's no other way, so please forgive the intrusion."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    descended to care for him instead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    place until it was too late. It wasn't until he saw the condition his home was in that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    regretted ever letting Mahiru enter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    main living space.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane's parents<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't about to complain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not kept especially tidy. Various items were scattered all over the living room, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "This is too pitiful to look at." The angel, Amane's savior, gave him a frank assessment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming<p></p>
    <p></p>
    appearance.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he'd known that he'd be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up a bit, but it was too late for that now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    serious cleaning sometime soon.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "First, I'm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    back. You can do that, right?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're coming back?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt<p></p>
    <p></p>
    toward her when she was soaking wet the day before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was told and started changing out of his school uniform.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's really a mess in here; there's nowhere to even step… How can anyone live like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next<p></p>
    <p></p>
    room, and felt quite ashamed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without<p></p>
    <p></p>
    realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the first thing he saw.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What time is it?" Amane asked, confused.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Seven in the evening," Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. "You slept for several hours."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    able to take a look at his surroundings.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn't have any of those at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his place, and he looked up at Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I brought it from home," she answered immediately.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks, either. Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    must have brought that over as well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru's curt answer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn't mean<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    already talking with a boy she barely knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    natural.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It's better<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to take it with something in your stomach… Are you hungry at all?" Mahiru asked gently.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm, a little bit," Amane answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you're welcome to have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Huh, you made it yourself?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is there anyone else here but me? If you don't want it, I'll eat it all alone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I'll eat it! Please let me eat it!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was caught off guard.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he'd never heard<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn't be awful.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane's sudden bow and insistence that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the side table.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'll bring it to you, so take your temperature first."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay," Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do it after I leave the room, please." There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    spied that the girl's pale cheeks were tinged red.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hadn't thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn't consider<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    accustomed to seeing much skin.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shyness almost palpable.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he'd also never had any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her like one would a distant masterpiece.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru wasn't some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    idol, and it was strangely adorable.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The two didn't have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird<p></p>
    <p></p>
    if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?" he asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-you don't have to tell me," Mahiru answered dismissively. "I'll be right back." She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because of all the clutter. Probably the latter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dangerous; she could be attacked or something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must've meant she was worried about him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    obligation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Then came a hesitant knock at the door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I've brought the porridge."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At the sound of Mahiru's concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I haven't taken my temperature yet," he called back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry, I spaced out."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few<p></p>
    <p></p>
    moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn't bad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay, I'm finished," Amane said as he put his shirt back on.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What was your temperature?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thirty-eight point three. I'll be better after I take some medicine and get some more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sleep."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won't eliminate the virus<p></p>
    <p></p>
    itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    done that intentionally because she'd thought it'd be easier on Amane's stomach.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She'd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    colds.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The dish wasn't steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hadn't brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down first.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the rice mixed easily.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here you go. It shouldn't be too hot."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm, thank you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru gave Amane a puzzled look as he received the bowl, but then he merely stared<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at the porridge while his spoon hovered over it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What is it; you want me to feed you? Sorry, but that's not on the menu," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asserted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nobody asked for that, okay? It's just… So I guess you can cook, too, huh?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I live alone, so of course I can." The girl's words stung, a heavy reminder of Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    own domestic failures. "But before you learn to cook, you should learn to clean up your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    room, Fujimiya."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, ma'am…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had quickly and thoroughly put him in his place. Amane grumbled quietly and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    scooped up some of the porridge, stuffing the spoon into his mouth in a bid to end the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    conversation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The flavor of the lightly salted rice spread across his tongue as he ate the porridge.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The mellow sourness of the pickled plums pulled it all together. It was truly a dish with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a perfect balance of flavors.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't like pickled plums that were too salty, but these had a milder taste and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a bit of sweetness. They were actually a favorite of his. Often, he liked to top green tea<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rice with pickled plums.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks for saying so. Though, really, once you've tasted one rice porridge, I think<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you've probably tasted them all." Mahiru's answer appeared indifferent, save for the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    very slightest beginnings of a smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without meaning to, Amane found himself staring at the beautiful girl's relieved<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression. Something about it seemed quite different from the more outgoing smile<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he occasionally caught her wearing at school.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Fujimiya?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry, it's nothing," he answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought it a shame that such a beautiful smile had been so fleeting, though he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kept the musing to himself. Instead, he shoveled spoonful after spoonful of porridge<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into his mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Anyhow, you rest today. And make sure to replenish your fluids. If you need to wipe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    away sweat, use this. I've put water into your washbowl, so make sure to wet it and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wring it out before wiping, okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After Amane had eaten, Mahiru diligently prepared an unopened sports drink, readied<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the bowl of water, and laid out a towel and spare cooling sheets. All had been carefully<p></p>
    <p></p>
    placed on the side table in Amane's bedroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way Mahiru was going to stay over at the home of a boy she barely knew.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wouldn't have stood for it if she'd tried. Thus, Mahiru had prepared everything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could've needed while he rested, and he was grateful for her diligence, though<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he stared at her the whole time she got everything ready.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This is an awful lot just to repay a favor. Once this is over, I guess we won't have much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reason to interact. It's a one-off thing, a freak occurrence; that's all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Well, since we won't be talking ever again, I guess it's all right to ask about that thing I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want to know.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whether from the medicine or his nap, Amane's head felt clearer, though he was still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exhausted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, there's something I've been wondering…," he started.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What is it?" Mahiru turned to look at him from where she was setting up all the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    essentials he'd need.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why were you sitting out in the rain? Did you have a fight with your boyfriend or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something?" The strange behavior that'd kicked off this whole chain of events had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been on Amane's mind since he'd first noticed it. Mahiru had been rocking back and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forth on a swing in the pouring rain. What could she have been doing there?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was precisely because Amane had been curious about Mahiru's slight resemblance<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to a lost child that he'd offered her his umbrella in the first place. He'd never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    discovered why she'd been out there in the storm to begin with, however.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had thought Mahiru had been waiting for someone, so he'd guessed that there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was a boy she was dating, even wondering if perhaps she and her boyfriend had gotten<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into an argument. In response to Amane's question, Mahiru looked at him as if she was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fed up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry, but I don't have a boyfriend, and I have no plans to get one," she replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? Why?" Amane asked almost unconsciously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Let me ask you, why did you assume I was dating someone?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "With how popular you are, I thought you'd have at least one or two boyfriends."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something about this back-and-forth made Mahiru seem much more like a normal girl<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to Amane. She was kind but strong-willed. To other people, though, he was sure she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed quite different. Mahiru was a beautiful girl who was tidy, sweet, quiet, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    humble. Her pretty face, so lovely that she was often called an angel, turned heads<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wherever she went, and her body was petite but possessed abundant curves. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    briefest sight of her instilled a strange, momentary feeling of wanting to protect her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That quality, combined with her excellent sense of style, made her an object of desire<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for many a schoolboy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    On top of all that, her grades kept her at the top of her class, and she was an all-around<p></p>
    <p></p>
    excellent athlete. What's more, Amane had just learned firsthand that she was good at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooking, too. That certainly wouldn't hurt her popularity.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just one glance was enough to know there must have been plenty of guys who were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    after her, and Amane knew for a fact that quite a few of his own classmates had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    romantic feelings for Mahiru. She could've had her pick of the litter, and it hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    occurred to him that she might not be seeing anyone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was what Amane had meant when he'd said that thing about one or two<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boyfriends, but the moment she'd heard those words, Mahiru's expression had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stiffened, if only for a moment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't have a boyfriend, and what's more, I'm not the kind of girl who would keep the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    company of several boys at once. It's absolutely out of the question."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes were so cold, they sent a shiver down Amane's spine. He realized<p></p>
    <p></p>
    immediately that he'd stepped on some kind of social land mine.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It might have been because of his sickness, but he felt a chill pass over him, and the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    room seemed drafty all of a sudden.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry, that's not what I meant. I apologize," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…No, I'm sorry for getting fired up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru bowing her head seemed to disperse the cold, tense atmosphere of the room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    More than being "fired up," Mahiru's icy reply to Amane's question had been like a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    blizzard, though he knew better than to point that out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Anyway, that's not what was going on at all. I was just trying to cool my head a bit…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    And I really am sorry that you caught a cold because you were worried about me,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine. I mean, it was my decision, after all. I feel kind of guilty about all this, actually.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I only gave you the umbrella as a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing. I'll try not to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bother you once this is all over."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was sure that Mahiru was only there to help out of some sense of obligation,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but when she heard what he had to say, she blinked a few times and gave him a curious<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look. It must have intrigued her to hear that he wouldn't be troubling her again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We don't really have any reason to interact, so it's not like it'll be a big deal. I mean,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even if you're the most beautiful girl in our grade, and a genius, and everyone calls you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an angel, I wasn't trying to hook up with you; I swear. You don't think that this was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some kind of scheme or something, do you?" Amane inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked away a little awkwardly. A bitter smile spread across her lips, as if she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been waiting for Amane to say those exact words. Finally, he realized that she wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just acting cagey. Mahiru had probably wound up in that sort of situation a few times<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before. A guy trying to get in with a beautiful girl by making her feel indebted was,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unfortunately, not unheard of.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It explained why Mahiru had been so wary of Amane that day in the rain. She hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been upset at him; she'd just been trying to protect herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It must be so irritating. Being bothered by guys you don't even like," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that's true, but…" Mahiru's voice trailed off.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Called it," quipped Amane, a little surprised to hear her admit it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So the quiet, charming, model student, the one everybody makes a big fuss over, the one<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everybody calls an angel, does have things she doesn't like. Why, she even gets annoyed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from time to time, just like the rest of us mortals. The thought gave Amane the sudden<p></p>
    <p></p>
    impression that he was seeing the real Mahiru for the first time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unfortunately, the way she glared back at Amane seemed to suggest that she was really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    regretting having ever met him. It looked like she resented him for making her reveal<p></p>
    <p></p>
    how she really felt.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Further proof that the angelic honor student has real emotions hidden deep down,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't really see the problem with that," admitted Amane. "Actually, I'm relieved. It's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nice to hear that the angel finds that stuff just as annoying as normal humans."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Please stop calling me that." Mahiru obviously hated the title others had given her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With disapproval in her eyes, she continued to gaze at Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even her displeasure seemed interesting to Amane, who smiled again and said, "Not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to worry, I won't bother you again without a good reason."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes opened wide as if his declaration had caught her by surprise. With the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    faintest whisper of a smile crossing her lips, she bowed sharply and left.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane lay in bed, staring vacantly up at the ceiling while thinking about Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though the medicine had taken effect, he was, unsurprisingly, still feeling sluggish.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he relaxed, sleep would surely claim him in no time at all. He closed his eyes and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reflected on the events of the day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No one would ever believe him if he told them that he'd been nursed back to health by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an angel with a surprisingly sharp tongue. The day's events were a secret shared only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by Amane and Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It feels kinda weird to call it a secret. It's more like it'd be a real pain to explain the whole<p></p>
    <p></p>
    story. It's just easier not to tell anybody, that's all, Amane reasoned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As he slowly lost consciousness, Amane told himself that, when tomorrow came, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and Mahiru would be nothing more than mere acquaintances again.<p></p>

    3 The Angel’s Generosity<p></p>
    As Amane had anticipated, he and Mahiru had returned to being nothing more than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    two people who attended the same school.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd been feeling much better the following day and had happened to run into Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    when he went out to shop at the convenience store, but they hadn't said very much to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    each other. Amane did catch that Mahiru looked a little relieved to see him well on his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    way to recovery.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Nothing changed back at school on the following Monday, either. The two were back<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to being strangers. The only tiny difference was that now, whenever they encountered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    each other on the way to school, she would greet him with a quick bow. That was all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, Amane, you feeling better?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm good, thanks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It seemed that Itsuki had also been worried about Amane. He'd been in rather bad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shape last Friday, after all. Amane's condition had been the first thing Itsuki asked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about when they saw each other outside the school building. Itsuki had even sent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane a text over the weekend: "You're not dead, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had sent back a message that he was fine, but it seemed Itsuki had only been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    half-convinced, because he let out a deep sigh of relief when he saw in person how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much better his friend was feeling.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, well, when I saw you in such bad shape, even I started to worry, man! It's all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    good if you're better now. You oughtta take better care of yourself. Start by cleaning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    your room or somethin'."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You sound like somebody else I know," Amane quipped.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing. Something happened this weekend that kind of opened my eyes. I'll clean<p></p>
    <p></p>
    my place up in a few days."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki didn't let up. "Nah, man, you gotta sort yourself out now!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane turned away in a huff. It would probably take more than half a day to clean that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mess up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Looking exasperated, Itsuki backed off a bit, saying, "I mean, you can live however you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want, ya know. But just clear a path you can actually walk through for the next time I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    come over."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'll deal with it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Wearing a sour face the whole time, Amane changed into his indoor shoes and headed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for his classroom. An extremely boisterous room caught his attention as he walked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down a hall, however, and he couldn't help but peek in.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Glancing in through a hallway window, Amane saw Mahiru, as beautiful as she'd ever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been, surrounded by her classmates.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whenever someone spoke to her, she would turn to them with a quiet smile. Everything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about her persona seemed totally different from the Mahiru he'd seen the other day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane suddenly broke out in a smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Noticing his friend's gaze, Itsuki's eyes followed the same path. He saw Mahiru and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    immediately understood.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shiina, huh? As popular as always. No surprise, given how pretty she is."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you know what they say. She's an angel. What about you, Itsuki? Think she's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cute?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I guess so. But I've got Chi, so only in a sorta aesthetic-appreciation-type way,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Quit going on about your girlfriend already."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki had a girlfriend named Chi, although that was a nickname. Her full name was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose Shirakawa.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They were an extremely close couple, madly in love with each other—it gave Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heartburn whenever he saw them together.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Although Amane was quick to dismiss the girlfriend talk, Itsuki didn't seem particularly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    offended. Amane often said things like that, so Itsuki just laughed. "You're heartless.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So lemme ask you: Do you think she's cute, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She's definitely beautiful, but that's all," answered Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How bland," Itsuki commented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She's like a flower on a high peak that my hand could never reach. I've got nothing to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    do with her. Looking is enough."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fair."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Some quirk of fate may have brought Mahiru and Amane together that other day, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they were truly destined to live in different worlds.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The idea that Amane, a self-admitted hopeless loser, and Mahiru, the beautiful superstudent who could do anything, might one day have any kind of relationship, let alone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a romantic one, was frankly ridiculous. It was a veritable impossibility.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That's right, Amane thought. There's no need to concern myself with her any further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What are you eating?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The theory that the two would never interact again was quickly disproven. Amane was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sucking down some nutritional jelly on his veranda while gazing up at the sky when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru called to him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It'd been too much of a bother to even go to the convenience store, so he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    contenting himself with the pouch of jelly he had at home while getting some air when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru unexpectedly came out onto her own veranda.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She leaned over her railing slightly, looked at the nutritional jelly pouch that was in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's mouth, and frowned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For a moment, Amane was frozen; he'd thought she was done with him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Can't you see? It's a ten-second energy-replenishment jelly," he finally answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Don't tell me that's what you're calling dinner?" Mahiru asked, incredulous.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course it is."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's all you're eating? A high school boy, with a healthy appetite?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's none of your business."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Normally, Amane would've eaten a boxed meal from the convenience store or something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    premade from the supermarket, but today, he'd neglected to pick something up for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dinner, and he didn't feel like instant ramen, so this was all he had. It probably<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wouldn't be enough, though, so he planned on having a snack later, too.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I guess I don't need to ask whether you can cook for yourself. It definitely doesn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seem like you can, at least. And yet you're living on your own, even though you can't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cook or clean…" Mahiru's observation was brutally honest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up. That's none of your business," Amane fired back, though he knew he couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    argue with the truth. He frowned and finished off the remainder of his jelly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd wised up about cleaning his place a couple days ago and was definitely planning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to do something about it sometime soon. Ruminating on Mahiru's scolding only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed to make Amane want to do it less, however. It also made him wonder why she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was making such a fuss over him in the first place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru just stared at Amane, then let out a soft sigh. "…Wait here," she instructed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before disappearing back into her own apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What now?" Amane grumbled as he listened to the clatter of the glass door closing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    behind her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd been told to wait, but he didn't know what for. Turning a puzzled gaze toward<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's apartment, Amane stood there obediently, but there was no immediate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    answer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It's starting to get chilly out here; I'd like to go inside, but…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd been told to stay put, so that was what he'd do. The autumn evening was colder<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than expected, and Amane's loosely fitting, casual clothes did little to help him stay<p></p>
    <p></p>
    warm.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane waited, watching his deep breaths come out white in the cold, he heard the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    electronic bell chime from his front door, announcing a visitor. It was pretty obvious<p></p>
    <p></p>
    who it was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Truly puzzled, Amane made his way toward the front door, dodging scattered clothes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and magazines on the floor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He knew who it was without even looking through the peephole, so he slid his feet into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a pair of slippers, took the chain off the door, and opened it. As expected, he came faceto-face with waves of sandy-blond hair.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What are you doing?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I couldn't stand how badly you were neglecting your health. These are just some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    leftovers I had, but please take them," Mahiru stated plainly as she abruptly stuck a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hand out in front of her. In her delicate palm, somewhat smaller than Amane's own,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was a plastic container. He could vaguely see some sort of stewed dish through the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    semi-transparent lid. He couldn't tell exactly what it was, however, as the container<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had filled with steam from the warmth of the food.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed to understand the confused look in Amane's eyes as he stood there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    blinking. She let out a deep sigh. "You're not eating properly. Nutritional supplements<p></p>
    <p></p>
    are just that—supplements. You can't live on them alone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What are you, my mom?" Amane jeered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I believe what I said is common sense. Also, shouldn't you have tidied up your room<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by now? There still isn't any room to walk."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru narrowed her eyes in obvious disappointment as she looked past Amane at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the room beyond, and Amane's words stalled in his throat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I have, a little."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, you haven't. Normally, people don't drop their clothes on the floor."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Those just… fell there."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That wouldn't happen if you washed, dried, folded, and put them away properly. Also,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you should bundle up your magazines after you're done reading them. That way you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    won't slip on one and fall."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't that he couldn't sense the small barbs in her words, but he also understood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Mahiru was, for some reason, genuinely concerned for him, so he couldn't dismiss<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything she was saying. After all, the clutter of magazines had almost tripped the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    both of them up just the other night. She had a point.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had no rebuttal. He screwed up his face, squeezed his mouth shut tight, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sullenly took the container from Mahiru's hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The food suffused his palm with a welcome warmth, especially after all the time spent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    standing on his chilly veranda.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So I can eat this?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you don't need it, I can throw it out," Mahiru answered flatly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I'm grateful for it. I don't usually get to eat an angel's home cooking."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Stop calling me that, seriously."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Using her school nickname was a kind of petty, needling revenge for her critical<p></p>
    <p></p>
    comments. Her feelings about the moniker were written clearly across her pale cheeks<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as they turned red.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no doubt about it—she hated being called an angel. Were he in the same<p></p>
    <p></p>
    position, Amane was certain he would hate it, too. That hardly needed to be said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Despite understanding Mahiru's stance, Amane couldn't help but smile when he saw<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her looking up at him with flushed cheeks and tiny, bitter tears forming.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not going to say I'm sorry," he declared.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was clear that any further teasing would be certain to wreck what little goodwill she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had left for him, so Amane figured it was prudent to give it a rest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    We're not even that close.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru also seemed not to want to hear any more, and she emphasized this by clearing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her throat forcefully as she pulled herself together.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her cheeks were still tinged with red, though, so she didn't look like much had changed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, thank you for this. Though, you don't really need to worry about what happened<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't. I considered that debt settled. This is for my own self-satisfaction… I saw that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you weren't taking care of yourself, and I was concerned; that's all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course. Mahiru pitied him; that was it. There was no way to hide—she'd gotten a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    very good look at how he lived the other night. Even now, she could see the garbage<p></p>
    <p></p>
    piled up in the hallway behind him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You need to at least start eating proper meals and… get your life together!" she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    scolded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, Mom," Amane answered sarcastically. He was getting a little tired of listening to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's nagging.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane churlishly carried the meal Mahiru had brought him back into his apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He grabbed a pair of disposable chopsticks he'd gotten at the supermarket and sat<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down on his living room couch, eager to sample the flavors of her cooking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He remembered enjoying the rice porridge that she'd brought him before, even though<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his sense of taste had been dulled by sickness. The slow-cooked porridge had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    possessed a rich, comforting taste that had been gentle on his stomach. If that was any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    indication, Mahiru's cooking was undoubtedly quite good, but now it was time to find<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out for sure.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As he hastily opened the lid of the container, the savory scent of stew drifted gently up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at him. Various root vegetables had been cooked together with some chicken. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    light-colored sauce underscored the vibrant hues of carrots and green beans, all of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    which had been cut into bite-size pieces.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's stomach growled, reminding him that the only thing he'd had to eat was some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nutritional jelly. He hastily snapped his disposable chopsticks apart and brought a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    piece of daikon radish to his mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yum."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's mouth was greeted with a complex flavor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Typical of the health-conscious Mahiru, the dish was only lightly seasoned, spiced<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mostly with dashi stock. It was immediately obvious that she hadn't used storebought, granulated dashi. Instead, she'd made it herself using with dried bonito fish<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and kombu seaweed. The difference in taste was night and day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As he chewed it thoroughly, the flavor of the dashi and the other seasonings, as well<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as the taste of the vegetables, spread gently through his mouth. Amane had never been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a fan of veggies. He usually went out of his way to avoid them, but in this dish, the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    essence of each ingredient came together in perfect harmony, and Amane happily<p></p>
    <p></p>
    savored them all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There wasn't much chicken. Perhaps Mahiru had done that on purpose as if to tell him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to eat more vegetables. What little meat there was had been cooked plump and juicy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was nothing to complain about there, Amane thought, aside from the quantity.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For something made by a high school girl, the ingredients were a little plain, but her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    skill more than made up for it. That Amane so readily enjoyed the food was enough of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a testament to that fact.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It would have been even better with some rice, and maybe some miso soup or clear<p></p>
    <p></p>
    broth on the side, but Amane didn't have any prepared. He was all out of rice anyway,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so that modest wish was not destined to be granted that night. It was too late now, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he regretted not buying any instant rice packets beforehand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That angel's amazing," Amane said to himself as he devoured the perfectly seasoned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    vegetables, chopsticks never slowing for a second.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    To think, she's great at school, and sports, and all kinds of housework.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If Mahiru had been there to hear Amane's praise, she would have hated it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here's this back. The food was good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The following evening, Amane carried the borrowed container over to Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The boy was certainly bad at housework, but not so bad that he couldn't wash<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something before giving it back. In his hand, he held the carefully cleaned little box,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    knowing that it was good manners to return it only after it had been thoroughly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    washed and dried.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had appeared the moment Amane rang the doorbell without even checking to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    see who it was, as if she'd been expecting him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was wearing a wine-colored knit dress, and when she saw her visitor, her eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    narrowed gently. She quickly checked the container and said, "You washed it and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything, huh? Look at you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane frowned slightly when she praised him like a little child.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, thank you for taking the time," Mahiru continued. "Now take this." She pressed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a new, warm container into Amane's hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    From what he could tell, there was saute ed pork and eggplant inside. It seemed to have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooled enough that the lid hadn't fogged up, for Amane could clearly spy the color of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eggplant, grilled pork, and sprinkled sesame seeds through the clear top. From the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    color, he guessed the sauce was probably miso flavor. The sight of the eggplant with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slight scorch marks and the lustrous pork definitely roused his appetite.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No one would deny that it looked delicious, but Amane couldn't understand why he'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been handed dinner again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, um, I just came to return the container," he tried to explain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "This is today's dinner," Mahiru answered coolly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I get that, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I just want to ask: You don't have any allergies, do you? Don't get the wrong idea,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though. I won't be catering to your tastes or anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't, but… I mean, I can't accept your food again."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Taking a portion of the girl's dinner for the second time in a row seemed wrong to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane. His malnourished body was grateful for the food, and Mahiru was clearly a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much better cook than other girls her age, and the meal he was holding was sure to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    delicious, but it also held no small amount of danger.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If someone from school saw the two of them meeting like this, it could turn into a big<p></p>
    <p></p>
    debacle. That would be the end of Amane's quiet student life for sure.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    These apartments were meant for single occupancy, but the rent was pretty high<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because of the building's location and the amenities. Amane had never seen another<p></p>
    <p></p>
    student from their school in the building—except Mahiru, of course—so he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably worrying over nothing. Even with that mild consolation, his brief meetings<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with the angel still made him wary.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I made too much, so I'm just happy to be rid of it," Mahiru explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…In that case, I'm happy to take it. But someone might get the wrong idea, since<p></p>
    <p></p>
    people usually do this sort of thing for someone they like…," Amane said sheepishly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And do you have the wrong idea?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, I guess not."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    One look at Mahiru's expression was enough to clear up any misconceptions about her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feelings toward Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way that a beautiful, talented girl like Mahiru could possibly fall for an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    oblivious slob like Amane. Sure, a cute next-door neighbor bringing him food seemed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like something out of a romantic comedy, but there was no romance here—and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certainly no comedy. The situation was as devoid of those elements as Amane's own<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment was devoid of rice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What kindness existed in the angel's barbed words had been born only from pity.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well then, there's no problem, is there? And anyway, it looks like you were surviving<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on convenience-store meals and side dishes from the supermarket," stated Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How could you tell?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not hard to see that your kitchen has barely been used, and you have a ton of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    disposable chopsticks from the convenience store and the supermarket on your desk.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Besides, I can tell just by looking at you. You've got an unhealthy complexion."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's expression froze. Mahiru had gotten all that just from one visit to his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment. Everything she'd said had been spot-on; he had no room to argue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…All right, I'll be going."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru bowed and went back inside her apartment, having said what she'd wanted to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    say and given him what she'd wanted to give.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane looked at the container in his hands as he listened to the jangling sound of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chain on the other side of Mahiru's front door slide into place. The heat from the food<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was beginning to warm the palms of his hands. He let out a soft sigh and returned to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As expected, the stir-fried sesame miso eggplant and pork was delicious. Amane found<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself wishing even more than yesterday that he'd bought some rice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As time went on, Amane began swapping an empty container for a full one every day,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and his diet improved dramatically.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's cooking was always light and healthy, and since every dish made him want<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rice, Amane started fixing microwave packets with each meal. The angel had a variety<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of cuisines in her repertoire: Japanese, Chinese, even Western. Each day brought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something new, but every single meal was delicious, and Amane developed an appetite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like never before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Like a wild animal grown fat on handouts, Amane quickly came to rely on Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    charity. Even as he continued to obediently accept container after container, he knew<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it was presumptuous to expect a meal every day. Still, he happily—and hungrily—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    licked his chops each time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're looking good lately. You fix your diet or something?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki took a long, hard look at Amane one day during lunch. Apparently, his complexion<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had improved—probably because he was finally supplying his body with much-<p></p>
    <p></p>
    needed nutrition.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane knew his friend was perceptive, and he felt a bit of a cold sweat break out as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he slurped the udon noodles he'd ordered for school lunch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Itsuki, you scare me," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why's that? Do you mean I'm right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, well, I guess you could say I've had no choice but to reexamine my lifestyle recently."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whenever Amane passed by Mahiru near their apartments, she would chide him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gently to take care of himself, and she was regularly sharing her dinner with him. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was only natural that his life had improved. On the one hand, he wanted to call her his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    guardian angel, but a small part of him also felt like she was meddling where it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    none of her business.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had indirectly confirmed Itsuki's suspicions by dodging the question, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki cackled with delighted laughter. "Yeah, I knew it. You always looked unhealthy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    'cause the way you were living was so crappy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But what made you decide to 'reexamine your lifestyle'?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I guess I was forced to."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, your mom found out?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're not right, but you're not far off, either."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru really did sound like Amane's mom at times. She was much too young and too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cute to be a mother, though. Still, the way the girl went to such lengths to care for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane made it hard for him to refuse her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Say, Itsuki? Do I really seem that unhealthy?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm… Well, to start with, you're pretty pale. I guess you're tall enough, but you're<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gangly. You're also always shuffling around all apathetic-like, so you look like a zombie."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But that's just how I look…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You think I don't know that? Try looking like one of the living for a change."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't be absurd… Wait, but seriously… a zombie…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't really sure because he almost never bothered to closely check his own<p></p>
    <p></p>
    face in the mirror, but apparently, he gave others the impression that he was barely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    alive. If he looked half-dead even on a good day, that would explain why Mahiru had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been so worried about him before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You should pay a little more attention to how other people see you, Amane. You're<p></p>
    <p></p>
    always hunched over, starin' at the ground. It makes you hard to approach, and it's not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like you go out of your way to get close to anybody, either. If I didn't know any better,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'd say you're the very definition of a moody teenager."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You sure know how to keep it casual when you're insulting a guy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fine, fine, I won't sugarcoat it, then. You look like a corpse, and your life is a mess."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki continued teasing his friend, insisting that he ought to take this opportunity to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pay more attention to his appearance and demeanor, not to mention his health.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sharply turning away, Amane replied sarcastically, "Thanks for your concern."<p></p>

    4 A Chance Encounter<p></p>
    "Ah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane heard a beautiful voice ring out like a bell from behind him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recently, he'd grown accustomed to hearing that voice, but only around his apartment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    building. Now he heard it while he was standing in the sweets aisle at the neighborhood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    supermarket.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had never expected Mahiru to acknowledge him in public, so he turned around<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with some bewilderment to see her standing there, eyes wide.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A supermarket basket hung from her arm, and inside it sat a daikon radish and some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tofu, as well as a package of chicken thighs and a carton of milk. These were likely the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ingredients for her dinner tonight.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This was nothing special. Amane had coincidentally stopped by the candy aisle at the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    same time. That was all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Just so you know, this is merely a coincidence," Amane asserted. "It's not like I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stalking you or anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know, I know." Mahiru nodded. "We're both just here because it's the closest<p></p>
    <p></p>
    supermarket." Before Amane had a chance to agree, he heard the girl mutter, "Really,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though, that's the first thing that came to mind…?" She stared down at a notebook that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was carrying.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was just like the meticulous Mahiru to dutifully record everything she needed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Ignoring Amane in favor of her flower-patterned notebook, Mahiru brushed past the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sweets and began searching the condiments on display in the next aisle.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something about Mahiru searching the shelves for kitchen staples and murmuring<p></p>
    <p></p>
    things like soy sauce and mirin in her lovely voice seemed cute to Amane. It was clear<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that the girl was in a strange kind of mood, however.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mirin is right here. Look," Amane said, pointing it out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, not that—I'm looking for the low-alcohol kind. I can't buy that, since I'm underage,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "This is considered alcohol?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mirin is sweet rice wine, after all. The ones that are specifically for cooking still have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    alcohol, but they add in salt to make it gross to drink, so even underage people can buy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been about to hand her a bottle of mirin when she suddenly refused it,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shook her head, and instead placed the low-alcohol alternative in her basket.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Learn something every day…" This was all new to Amane, who did so little housework<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that even these simple tidbits seemed revelatory. He watched Mahiru as she moved<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quickly on down the aisle, stopping in front of a shelf full of soy sauce.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru frowned, as if she had only just noticed the price labels. "…Bargain price, limit<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one bottle per person…" She had apparently been intending to buy a spare. Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grumbled in disappointment and turned to glance at Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Maybe… I could buy one, too?" Amane quickly sensed what Mahiru had been trying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to convey with her eyes, and with a wry smile, he picked up a bottle of soy sauce. When<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he did, her lips formed a satisfied arch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's helpful to have someone who understands," she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're more economical than I expected," Amane commented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I don't see why I shouldn't find the best prices when I can. Cut down on needless<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expense, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wonder if that's what they call a thrifty mentality. Well, as long as you're living on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an allowance from your parents, I guess that's for the best."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane may have technically lived alone, but in reality, his parents still supported him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His family was fairly rich, and they covered the rent of his clean, safe apartment, took<p></p>
    <p></p>
    care of his school fees, and provided him with a more-than-fair allowance. Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    never had to worry about his expenses, but he was grateful for everything his parents<p></p>
    <p></p>
    did for him, so he tried not to waste money.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…That's right. We depend on their support, so it's important to be frugal," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    replied matter-of-factly, taking stock of the contents of her basket. Her voice was cold,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like something had stolen away her warmth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane flinched at Mahiru's flat tone, but when she looked up from her groceries, her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression had returned to normal. The gloomy eyes he'd seen in that brief moment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were already gone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Anyway, are you really buying that?" Mahiru asked, as if to change the subject,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looking at the packs of instant rice and the container of potato salad that were in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    basket that Amane was holding.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The meals that Mahiru was sharing with him were, of course, delicious, but they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    weren't enough on their own. To compensate, Amane would pick up a staple food and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    side salad like he'd done today.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, it's dinner," Amane explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's unhealthy," Mahiru shot back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're so fussy. I'm buying a salad, aren't I?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A potato salad… How is your body still functioning?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mind your own business."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru put wordless pressure on him, scrutinizing him with eyes that reproached him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and told him to eat more vegetables. Amane turned away and let Mahiru go ahead of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chatting about this and that, the two bought their respective things. Amane had started<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to pack his purchases into a plastic bag, but Mahiru produced a reusable bag she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brought and quickly put everything into it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was truly an environmentally conscious angel.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had only brought the one bag, however, and Amane was a little anxious that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the quantity of groceries was too much for it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With the milk, soy sauce, and low-alcohol cooking mirin, that was four liters of liquid<p></p>
    <p></p>
    altogether, and if they weighed anything like water, that meant four kilograms right<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there. There was still the whole daikon radish and the other ingredients to consider,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too. The bag had to be really heavy. Everything was packed in quite neatly, but still, it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would surely be hard work carrying it all the way back to Amane and Mahiru's building.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She's been cooking for me, so she must be going through more seasonings and ingredients<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than she normally does.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She's gotta be making a lot in order to split the dishes with me. The amount she gives me<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is always nearly a whole meal's worth. Mahiru says it's all just extra, but she must be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    making a lot of food on purpose.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After Mahiru had gone through so much trouble to take care of Amane, it'd wound his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pride if he didn't do anything to help her out now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As soon as Mahiru finished packing the reusable bag, Amane took hold of the handles<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and lifted it. It wasn't all that heavy to him, of course, but he could tell that it would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    definitely be difficult for her to carry for very long.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru may have been really good at sports, but pure arm strength was an entirely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    different matter. Surely, Amane thought, his eyes tracing her slim figure under her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clothing, surely there was no way that her slender arms could command the power<p></p>
    <p></p>
    needed to lift these heavy groceries.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Caramel-colored eyes blinked rapidly. Mahiru looked surprised—or maybe a little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    concerned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm not stealing it or anything," Amane said in his defense.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not worried about that," Mahiru replied. "It's just… I can carry my own bags, you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It'd be more charming if you'd be quiet and let me take care of you for a change,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quipped Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's basically saying I'm not charming," Mahiru answered flatly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, think about how you act at school, then compare that to how you act toward<p></p>
    <p></p>
    me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru took a step back. Maybe Amane had unknowingly hit a nerve. The version of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself that she showed at school—the kind, gentle, modest girl everyone was familiar<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with—that was not the person Amane knew. Yes, Mahiru was always kind to him, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was also far more direct. She never sugarcoated anything or hid behind niceties.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Everything she said to him was brief and frank.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane took advantage of Mahiru's stunned silence and briskly sauntered off toward<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the supermarket exit, holding his schoolbag in one hand and the reusable shopping<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bag stuffed with groceries in the other. He was leaving her behind, but he didn't care.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unconcerned, he continued on as the gap between them grew wider. He didn't slow<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down or give her a chance to catch up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They had already been standing next to each other in the supermarket, after all. If they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    walked side by side on the way home and somebody saw them, that could start rumors.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So really, this kind of distance was best for both of them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hurried on with his heavy burden while pretending not to be aware of Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As he strode along, he thought he heard someone mutter "Thanks" behind him.<p></p>

    5 The Angel and the Great Cleaning Campaign<p></p>
    Amane was terrible at housework of any kind, but the thing he was worst at was cleaning.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Surprisingly, he actually could cook. More specifically, he could prepare something hot<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and usually technically edible, as long as he was willing to set aside petty concerns like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    presentation or flavor and also assumed the possibility of grievous bodily injury at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some point during the process. He wasn't completely incapable of preparing food.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Laundry was all right, too. That much was possible for anyone, even Amane. If push<p></p>
    <p></p>
    came to shove, there was always the option of taking his clothes to a coin laundromat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    All it boiled down to was a matter of stuffing everything into the machine and letting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it run with detergent and water inside. Amane could pull that off, no problem. The one<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thing he was absolutely hopeless with, however, was cleaning.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What do I do?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    One weekend, Amane had finally gotten tired of listening to both Mahiru and Itsuki<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lecture him day in and day out about cleaning his apartment and had resolved to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    finally do something about it. The only problem was that Amane was at a complete<p></p>
    <p></p>
    loss on how to get started.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He knew that this was his own fault, but the first problem was that his things were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    piled up all over the place, and he couldn't figure out how he could even begin to get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    them in order. Unsure of what else to do, Amane started by washing his bedsheets and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    airing out his futon.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What should come next? he wondered. Clothes and magazines are scattered everywhere,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so there's really no room to walk.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    One small mercy was that he always threw out any food garbage right away, so there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were no awful stenches or greasy stains. It was simply an enormous amount of clutter<p></p>
    <p></p>
    —enough that it seemed like an insurmountable problem.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane sighed softly at the mountain of work before him, the doorbell rang. He let<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out a little gasp.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Rather than a regular visitor, he had begun to think of his neighbor more like a delivery<p></p>
    <p></p>
    person, a blessing from above who just handed over gifts and then left. As he stood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before his messy room, however, Mahiru seemed like a savior.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane scrambled for his front door but couldn't find his footing. He stumbled, caught<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself, and carefully crept the rest of the way to the door with one hand pressed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    against the wall for balance.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry, I wanted to pick up my container a little earlier today… What are you doing?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru asked when Amane opened the door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I was trying to clean," he admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked at Amane, still off-balance, with a rather astonished expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I heard a loud noise just now," she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I almost fell."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I bet you did. You haven't even begun to clean, have you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wasn't sure how to start."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can tell."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane grimaced at Mahiru's comment. It was no less candid than usual, and Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really couldn't think of anything to justify his lack of progress. Besides, he knew that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    if he got sulky now and lashed out, he wouldn't be able to get her advice on how to go<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about cleaning his apartment. The trouble was that he wasn't sure how exactly to ask<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for Mahiru's help.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I was hoping for some cleaning tips, but I wonder if she'll actually give me any advice…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hesitated when he saw that Mahiru was peering past him at the clutter beyond.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her eyes conveyed her shock at the disastrous scene behind him. It truly must've been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an awful sight.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Unbelievable… I'll help you clean your apartment."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even Amane knew that it would be too shameless to ask Mahiru to help him clean.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That's why he'd only been planning to see if she had any suggestions. Never had he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dared to imagine that Mahiru would come right out and offer to help.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I hate the idea that the apartment next to mine is so filthy." Such scathing words, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    again, Amane could offer no argument. "You must think it's so easy to live alone, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you can't even clean up after yourself. Worse, you act like it's no problem, like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything will sort itself out eventually, but it clearly hasn't. Why don't you stop and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    take a moment to look at yourself?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was at a loss for words. His mother had always told him that if he was diligent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about cleaning regularly, it would be easy, but he'd ignored her, and this was the result.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was fully aware that he was suffering the consequences of his own actions.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look, as long as you keep up with routine cleaning, your place won't get this bad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    again. It's obvious that you have some terrible habits," Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're absolutely right," agreed Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He couldn't get angry with her. He already owed her so much, and she'd been so kind<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to him. Besides, everything she was saying about his past behavior was true. He had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    underestimated how difficult living alone would be, and he really did just sort of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    assume that everything would somehow work itself out, and this was the result.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could only nod solemnly at Mahiru's words.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, is it all right if I start with this room?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Is it all right with you?" Amane answered with a question of his own.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm the one who's offering, so of course it's all right. I'm going to go get ready, so while<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I do, if you have anything you don't want me to see, or any valuables, please put them<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in a closet and lock them up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not worried about that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane refused to even entertain the idea that someone who had been so kind to him,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even despite her sharp words, might steal from him. Not to mention that Mahiru was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    far too good-hearted to ever harm another person like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're not?" she inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There's no way that you would do something like that," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, that's not what I… Look, aren't you worried that I might see something that, as a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boy, you'd rather hide?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah… uh, well, unfortunately I don't happen to have any such things."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, in that case, it's fine, then. All right, I'm going to go change clothes and fetch<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some cleaning supplies. I don't take cleaning lightly, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru returned to her apartment, and Amane watched her go with a wry smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She came back wearing different clothes: a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pants. The T-shirt closely followed the lines of her body, the delicate fabric bringing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the curves and edges into full relief. Mahiru's long hair had been skillfully gathered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into a perfectly round bun, and Amane felt strangely uncomfortable being able to see<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the white nape of her neck.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Previously, he had only ever seen her in dresses and skirts, and he found there was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something refreshing about this look. Amane had thought before that boyish clothes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like this probably wouldn't suit her well, but he had clearly been wrong. He was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    beginning to realize that beautiful girls looked good in whatever they put on.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This new outfit looked comfortable for moving around the house, but it was also a look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Mahiru could've worn around town. Amane never would've imagined that these<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were clothes that she was okay with getting dirtied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't mind if those get messed up?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I was planning to throw these out soon anyway, so it's fine if they get a bit dirty."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru scanned the cataclysm that was Amane's apartment and sighed softly. "I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    only going to say this once: We're going to clean thoroughly, got it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I understand."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good, then let's get to it. I'm not going to go easy on you, and I won't let this end<p></p>
    <p></p>
    halfway through. I assume you have no objections?" Mahiru had posed the question<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so forcefully that Amane could do nothing but sheepishly reply in the affirmative.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So began the great battle to clean Amane's apartment. A battle spearheaded by an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    angel.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "First things first, let's toss any clothes into the laundry basket. Usually when you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clean, you work from top to bottom, but we have to handle the clutter on the floor first<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before we can run the vacuum cleaner. Before we start the wash, we can divide the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clothes into different loads, since there are too many to wash at once. Do you want to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    split them into things you wear and things you don't wear? Or do you want to wash<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Just do it however you like…," replied Amane. It seemed so obvious to him now. Of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    course they had to clear the floor before trying to do anything else.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…There isn't any underwear out here or anything, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Those are in my dresser, as you would expect."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's fine, then. We can probably put off washing clothes for now, since even if we<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wash and dry them, we'll kick up dust by cleaning and just end up having to do them<p></p>
    <p></p>
    again. If you're not in a hurry, you can do the laundry after we finish cleaning."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Now, regarding the magazines. Really, the only thing to do is to throw them out. I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    suppose it's a bit of a different story if you're collecting them, but from the way you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    keep them piled up everywhere, I doubt that's the case. If you do want to hold on to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some part of one, tear out the page and put it in a scrapbook, then dispose of the rest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Tie up any magazines you're getting rid of and put them out for collection."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru set about the task of cleaning right away, directing Amane to put his discarded<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clothing into the laundry basket as she gathered up every last magazine. She told him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to speak now if there were any that Amane wanted to keep, but there weren't any in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    particular that he needed, so he simply shook his head. Having received the answer<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she required, Mahiru skillfully tied up the bundle using some plastic cord that she had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apparently brought with her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "When you're finished gathering the clothes, please go through the other assorted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clutter and decide whether to throw anything out. All these different things on the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    floor: same as before, sort them into what you need to keep and what you don't. Then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    put the latter in the trash. Got it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Uh-huh," Amane answered meekly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you have a problem with taking orders, you'd better tell me now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I don't, but… I was just thinking about how quick you're doing all of this."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If I don't, we'll run out of time. It's total chaos in here, after all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though it was the weekend, time was limited. If they were going to run the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    vacuum, it would have to be during the day, considering that the noise would be a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nuisance to the neighbors. Since Mahiru knew that it would take a lot of effort to get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the place to a state where they could vacuum, she was working to tidy up as quickly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as possible.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    One part of Amane felt bad for letting her do so much. On the other hand, under<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's direction, more and more of the floor began to appear for the first time in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    long while.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Professor Shiina…," Amane muttered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you're going to ask for guidance from me like I'm a teacher, first learn by imitating.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'm not going to sort through your personal effects, so please be diligent and keep only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    what you really need," Mahiru instructed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, sir."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Please don't address me as a man."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The angel nonchalantly returned Amane's jabs as she skillfully cleared up more of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clutter with a serious expression the whole time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had a bad habit of hoarding useless junk, and he was both grateful for Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decisiveness and envious of it. Here she was, in a stranger's apartment, picking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    through the mess without hesitation. She really was the spitting image of an angel.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was so efficient that she could have easily cleaned up the whole place by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself had she wanted to. However, likely because she was in such a hurry, she got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    careless about watching her footing. There was no doubt that it was Amane's fault for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    leaving it on the floor, but Mahiru slipped on a piece of discarded clothing and lost her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    balance.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The instant a small "Ah!" escaped Mahiru's mouth, Amane dived across the room,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    aiming for the spot where he thought Mahiru would most likely fall.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A light, sweet fragrance mixed with the musty smell of the dust that had been kicked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up in the panic.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane landed on his backside, leaving his rear end to suffer a dull sting, but it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tolerable. He groaned just a bit as he felt the weight of Mahiru pressing down on him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She must be happy that I caught her right away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Fujimiya?" Mahiru looked up at him. She didn't seem angry, but she didn't seem<p></p>
    <p></p>
    particularly happy about the situation, either. Mostly, she just sounded surprised. "I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    can accept the blame for falling, but this is exactly why you must tidy up, because<p></p>
    <p></p>
    otherwise things like this are bound to happen."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm really sorry, honestly… You're not hurt, are you?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm fine. Thanks for going out of your way to catch me. I'm sorry, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, it's all my fault…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wouldn't have been able to bear it if Mahiru had gotten hurt while helping him,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    especially considering she was already sharing meals with him. That would've been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    absolutely unforgivable; he wouldn't have even been able to look her in the eye.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he needed to, he was considering kneeling and asking for forgiveness, but Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't seem too upset over her tumble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We're cleaning up so that things like this don't happen anymore, understand?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah. I'm really very sorry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine; you don't need to apologize. I'm helping you because I feel like it, after all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked just a little bit flustered as she gazed up at Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane suddenly realized how close they were and was aware of her pressing against<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him. For a boy who basically never interacted with girls on a regular basis, this was a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heart-pounding situation. Even though neither of them had any romantic feelings for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the other, something felt very wrong about it somehow.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't seem to be conscious of the situation, so Amane gently grabbed her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shoulder and pushed her off of him; then he stood up before the awkwardness could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    show on his face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Should we… keep cleaning?" he managed after a moment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, that's a good idea," Mahiru replied. Fortunately for Amane, she appeared to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    oblivious to his trembling as she grabbed the hand Amane extended and rose to her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed unaware of how closely she'd been pressed up against him, because<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she just maintained her usual expression. Amane figured that a girl like Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    must've been used to the attention of a lot of boys. Surely a little contact like that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wouldn't be enough to unnerve her like it did him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Smiling wryly at Mahiru's demeanor, Amane decided it would be wrong to leave<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything up to her and returned to cleaning with newfound resolve. Even though<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the task was wholly unfamiliar, he did his best to struggle through.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You are full of surprises."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was too focused on his work to notice the quiet words that escaped Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lips, nor did he see that her ears, hidden by her straw-colored hair, had turned slightly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    red.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Whew, now, this is clean."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In the end, it had taken the pair the entire day to clean Amane's apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Several hours were spent tidying up the clutter on his floor, and then, between<p></p>
    <p></p>
    washing the clothes, dusting the shelves and light fixtures, scrubbing the windows,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and vacuuming, the entire day had flown by before they knew it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The sun had been visible when Mahiru came over, but it had long since set by now,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    proof of just how long she and Amane had been working.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It had certainly been no small task, but those efforts were not without results. Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment was so clean that he barely recognized it. There was no unnecessary clutter,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and he could see the floor! Once-dirty windowpanes and frames didn't have a single<p></p>
    <p></p>
    speck of dirt on them. The lights, too, shone brighter now that they had been dusted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The place was finally clean. Without all the junk crowding every surface, it actually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked to be quite a comfortable space.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "To think that it took us a whole day," Mahiru observed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Guess that's what it takes when it's such a mess…," Amane answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But it was your mess."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "R-right you are."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane verbally prostrated himself before his angelic savior, who had taken mercy on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him. Mahiru, who had wasted one of her precious weekend days helping him, finished<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tying up a garbage bag with a beleaguered look. She didn't seem upset, but a hint of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fatigue showed on her face, though it was mixed with a sense of accomplishment. That<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was only natural, since she had been working all day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After everything that had transpired, Amane would have been ashamed to simply let<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru go make dinner. It'd be unforgivable to expect her to do any more work,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whether she shared a portion of her cooking with him today or not.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now that it's evening, I don't feel like going shopping, so I'm going to order a pizza or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something. Please let me treat you today. After all, you've been giving me all kinds of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    food and stuff," Amane offered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, but—," Mahiru started, but she was quickly cut off.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you don't want to eat with me, I'll order one for you, and you can take it home."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This gesture was more about showing gratitude than trying to get Mahiru to eat with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him, so if she wanted to eat alone, Amane didn't mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…That's not what I meant. It's just… I was surprised, because I've never ordered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pizza."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, you've never ordered pizza?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I live alone, but I've never ordered pizza… I've made it myself, though."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's amazing that you would even think to make it," Amane exclaimed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Normally, if someone decided they wanted pizza, the three options were to buy a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ready-made one at the store, get it delivered, or go eat it in a restaurant. He was sure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that there were very few people who would think to go through the long, laborious<p></p>
    <p></p>
    process of making one from scratch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, there's nothing strange about ordering pizza for delivery," Amane asserted. "I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    do it all the time myself: order delivery or go to a family restaurant solo… you know,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like most people."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I've actually never been to one of those, either," Mahiru admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now, that is rare. I go alone pretty often, and my parents go to restaurants whenever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they don't feel like cooking. I guess your parents aren't the type to eat out often, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…In our house, the help made the meals."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The help? Damn, you must be really rich."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Finding out that Mahiru was fabulously wealthy explained a lot. It certainly cleared up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    why Mahiru's mannerisms were so graceful and refined—and why her clothes and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    possessions were always top quality. Even the girl's gait seemed to speak of an affluent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    upbringing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At Amane's words, Mahiru broke into a thin smile. "You're right; I think I am<p></p>
    <p></p>
    comparatively well-off."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Quickly, Amane began to regret what he'd said, realizing that Mahiru's smile was not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one of delight or pride but rather a display of self-mockery. It seemed that her family<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was an area of discussion that was better left alone, and Amane didn't plan to pry any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Everybody has a thing or two they'd rather not talk about. It's only polite to respect that,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    especially with people you don't know very well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, then this will be an interesting experience, won't it? Here, order what you like."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Dropping the topic of Mahiru's parents, Amane showed her a menu for a pizza place<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane occasionally ordered from. Out of all the places that delivered, it was the best.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Their pizza was no match for one cooked in an authentic wood-fired oven, of course,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but they did offer a wide variety of toppings. Their choices ranged from the standard<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fare to stuff more suited to little kids, so Amane figured that there was sure to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something that would appeal to Mahiru's tastes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru accepted both the change of subject and the pizza menu. She immediately<p></p>
    <p></p>
    began poring over the list of options, her luminous brown eyes drawn to the many<p></p>
    <p></p>
    colorful photos of different pizzas. Her eyes weren't usually very expressive, but now<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they shimmered vividly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She must really be looking forward to this, Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed a bit nervous, but after considering it for a little while, she pointed out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a party pizza with four types of toppings and said hesitantly, "All right, this looks good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She turned an expectant gaze to Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With a slight smile, Amane nodded, picked up his phone, and dialed the number<p></p>
    <p></p>
    printed on the menu. Mahiru's eyes sparkled with anticipation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    An hour later, their pizza arrived. Mahiru dug in without hesitation. The pizza was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    divided into sections to allow the different flavors to be sampled on their own, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she'd hesitated a little over which one to try first but finally decided to start with a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    piece covered with a hearty helping of bacon and sausage.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was not surprised when Mahiru nibbled at her slice with small, delicate bites.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He supposed her refined upbringing had taught her to eat everything with poise and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grace, even delivery pizza.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Watching Mahiru gave Amane a warm feeling inside, like he was watching a small, cute<p></p>
    <p></p>
    animal. She was strangely adorable as her eyes closed and her expression relaxed a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    little while she chewed on the stretchy cheese. Usually, the girl appeared so mature; in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this moment, however, she finally looked her age.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane quelled an intense urge to pat Mahiru's head as she enjoyed the pizza with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    little, mincing bites.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing, you just look like you're enjoying it," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Please don't stare at me so much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The frown she cast at Amane was anything but cute, however.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Geez, you've really got no charm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that suits me fine. If I were to act like I always do at school, you'd say I was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    making you uncomfortable."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I guess that's true. I'm more familiar with this version of you than the school<p></p>
    <p></p>
    version."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At school, Amane barely ever even saw Mahiru, and they had certainly never spoken<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there. He only occasionally caught a glimpse of her, and she always wore that same,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    impenetrable smile that she showed to everyone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Here, he got to see beyond that layer. This has to be the real Mahiru, Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At school, she always adopted her fake, public persona.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "As far as I'm concerned," he continued, "I never get tired of this version."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The version with no charm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't hold a grudge… You know, how do I put this…? I can never tell what you're<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thinking when you're at school."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mostly about my schedule and my classes, I suppose."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So even you can be clueless once in a while, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had meant to say that Mahiru always looked like she had some secret on her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mind, but Mahiru apparently took his words at face value. She looked at him with a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    subtle protest in her eyes, as though she had meant something else entirely.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I, uh, didn't mean it like that," Amane quickly added. "It's just… You don't show what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you're thinking. All I meant was that it's easier to be around someone who's honest<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about their feelings, even if they're a little rude, than someone who you can never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    read."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Do you think how I behave at school is bad?" Mahiru asked directly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I can't really hate on it, since it's probably the secret to your success. I just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wonder if you ever get tired of it," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not really. I've been acting like that since I was little."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hard-core, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If she'd been keeping up this act since childhood, spending her whole life trying to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the perfect young woman everyone expected her to be, Amane could understand how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it would definitely be difficult for her to set that persona aside.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been able to infer a little bit about Mahiru's home life, but he knew that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there was no way he could ask her more about it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, isn't it nice to have a place where you can relax? And now you've even got a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    buddy to chill with."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Honestly, I don't find you relaxing at all. You make my stomach turn in knots," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stated coldly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm… sorry?" Amane apologized, a little dumbstruck.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru gave an exaggerated shrug and let out a strange little laugh.<p></p>

    6 A Visit from a Friend<p></p>
    After the day-long cleanup, Amane felt like the wall between Mahiru and him had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    become ever-so-slightly thinner, but that didn't necessarily mean they had become<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much closer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They still had absolutely zero contact at school; they would make small talk sometimes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    when he went to get his portion of dinner from her, but that was all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just the other day, Mahiru had scolded Amane, telling him that he had to keep his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment tidy. Her words were definitely stern, but they also made it clear that she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    actually did care about him, at least a bit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Amane was receiving frequent reminders and tips on cleaning, his apartment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    remained as nice as it had been when he and Mahiru had finished tidying up the place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wow, it really is clean." That was the first thing Itsuki said when he came over on a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    day off. He muttered in an astonished voice when he saw the drastic transformation<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the living room had undergone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I never thought your place could look this good. It was so dirty. I remember I helped<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you pick up stuff once before, but it was a wreck the very next day."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Give it a rest," Amane shot back at his friend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, but seriously, think about it. What's the longest number of days you've gone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    without dropping something on your floor?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "This is easily a new record. I've kept it going for two weeks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Two weeks?! That's it? That's nothing to be proud of, you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane scowled a little. He was now keenly aware that normally, people did not leave<p></p>
    <p></p>
    their things lying around on the floor. Still, he knew that Itsuki was only speaking from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a place of kindness and common sense, so Amane couldn't say much. After all, Itsuki<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had helped him out, too, long before Mahiru ever had, so Amane knew he shouldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    act like a jerk.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki smiled cheerfully at Amane's sullen silence. "Hey, I guess if your apartment's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this clean, I could even bring Chi over."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way; why should I have to watch you two flirting in my own home?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No need to be shy, buddy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't turn my place into your hangout!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Why should I have to watch my friend and his girlfriend getting all lovey-dovey?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wished Itsuki could understand his position and appreciate what kind of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    torture it was like to have to watch a sickeningly sweet couple flirting all the time. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    knew that Itsuki was just joking about bringing Chi over, but even so, Amane didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    find it very amusing that he constantly had front-row seats to their cloying relationship.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Relax, it was just a joke. Anyway, now that you've finally got the place clean, don't go<p></p>
    <p></p>
    messing it up again, you hear?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I've got it under control," Amane assured.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Someone like you… Well, whatever. Just make sure you get in the habit of putting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    things away after you take them out."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you my mom…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now, Amane, dearie, you have to be diligent about cleaning your room!" Itsuki mocked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's so creepy; you sound so much like my mom, it's scary!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt a shiver rocket down his back when Itsuki scolded him in a forced falsetto.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was sure Itsuki had never even met his mother, but still, the impression had hit a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nerve. Itsuki's impersonation of a lady wasn't particularly soothing, either. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stuck out his tongue at him, and Itsuki cackled with amusement.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is that what your mom's like, Amane? Because mine is really cold toward me…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Actually, I'm jealous. My mom bugs me whenever she gets the chance."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She sounds like a mom who really cares about her son."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I think she's just overly attached…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I'm sure she has to look after you because you're such a slob."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, shut up. I mean it, you know, that my mom is too clingy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Perhaps because Amane was an only child, his mother was always fussing over him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She didn't exactly spoil him, but she did poke her nose around in his business and read<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too much into things. Amane certainly didn't hate her, but she made him uncomfortable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at times.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother had given him all sorts of instructions when he'd left home to live on his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    own and attend high school, and sometimes she would show up to check on him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    without warning. The pop-ins could be pretty awful.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, doesn't that just show how much she treasures you, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And her love is a heavy burden."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, I give up. You're the kind of guy who never appreciates what he's got till it's gone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You talk like you've got it all figured out, but don't you have your own problems<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dealing with that kind of meddling?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ha-ha! It's Chi, man; what else can I do?" Itsuki had all sorts of issues when it came<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to his father and his girlfriend, so his lecture really didn't have much weight behind it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even so, Amane knew there was some truth to what his friend was saying, so he didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    argue any further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki sighed quietly, as if to tell Amane to let him worry about his own problems. His<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression remained cheerful and carefree, however. "I'll mess up anybody who<p></p>
    <p></p>
    interferes with me and Chi!" Itsuki said, declaring something a little unsettling.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Anyway, I'll figure out something for my dad situation, so it's all good. For the time<p></p>
    <p></p>
    being, how 'bout you sort your life out, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki laughed loudly, and Amane responded by making a sour face. "I know that; you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    don't have to tell me." He smiled secretly to himself, however, thinking how he'd heard<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that before from another person recently.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki had come to visit Amane's apartment in order to see how he was living. Well,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    actually, he'd mostly come to hang out and mess around, so their discussion about the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    state of the room quickly wrapped up, and before long, they were playing a video<p></p>
    <p></p>
    game. Their initial intention had been to study for a test the next week, but that notion<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had been quickly discarded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Careful with the health packs; we're gonna run out," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We'll think of something; it'll be fine," Itsuki answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not at this level it won't…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane pondered how best to deal with his less cautious co-op player, the sound of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the doorbell rang through the room and immediately gave rise to a different worry.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm? A visitor?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki looked up, too, after pausing the game. He knew that Amane had never really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    told anyone else where he lived, and that he didn't have any friends who might visit<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him at home, besides Itsuki himself. More importantly, any regular visitor would have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been stopped at the lobby downstairs anyway, so a page should have come through<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the intercom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't really know, but it must be a neighbor, right? Distributing a community notice<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or something," Amane fibbed, knowing quite well who it likely was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, gotcha," Itsuki answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'll just be a minute."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane did his best to dispel Itsuki's suspicions and hurried toward the front door,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    struggling to hide the twitch in his face that might give him away. He was lucky that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru hadn't called out to him after ringing the buzzer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He opened the door quickly, not bothering to check who it was, and slipped through<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the small opening to get outside where he couldn't be seen. Amane made sure to close<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the door behind himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just as he'd suspected, it was Mahiru standing there, blinking in surprise at Amane,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    who must have appeared to have been acting very unusual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Immediately, he pressed an index finger to his lips and shushed Mahiru. "…Please<p></p>
    <p></p>
    speak softly. Itsuki is here."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Itsuki?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My friend. He came over to play games."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru nodded in understanding of Amane's secretive behavior, then passed him a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    food container as she did every day without bothering to question him any further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Inside was a type of stew called oden, the perfect dish for the season now that the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    weather had gotten cold. Mahiru had probably been preparing it since morning. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    accepted it with gratitude and let out a soft sigh as he looked at Mahiru. There was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really no reason she ought to be doing this every day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look, I really appreciate what you do, but… I don't have a lot of time. Sorry," Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apologized.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wasn't waiting to be thanked or anything… I'm glad, you know, that we cleaned up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough that you can invite friends over," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I guess I should kneel down and thank you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way; don't do that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked at him with astonishment in her eyes. Perhaps she thought getting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane to do something like that would make her akin to a tyrant. Amane smiled wryly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There had been a bit of earnestness in his statement, because he truly was indebted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to her. She'd done so much for him that he really ought to be on his knees. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couldn't reconcile continuing to accept all the food for free, so he decided that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wanted to discuss paying her for the meals at some later date.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if your friend is here, I suppose you can't talk for too long. Excuse me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're always helping me out. I'll make sure to keep this secret from Itsuki."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Please do."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, even if I told him everything, he probably won't believe me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose not."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's honest confirmation raised some complex feelings for Amane, but he knew<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was right. If he was in Itsuki's shoes and someone told him that Mahiru Shiina had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been making meals for him daily, he definitely wouldn't believe them. Anyone would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dismiss such a claim as a fantasy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was how out of reach this angel was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Normally, it would be impossible to imagine Mahiru treating even a handsome,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    superior man to her home cooking, let alone a mediocre and slovenly guy like Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Hell would sooner freeze over.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Can I ask you one thing?" Amane called.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What is it?" Mahiru stopped before entering her apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What good does it do you to keep sharing your meals with me?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Typically, people didn't give away food for free—they expected something in return.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane probably wouldn't have thought about doing the same for Mahiru if their<p></p>
    <p></p>
    positions had been reversed. Even though he didn't believe for a moment that there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was even the slightest possibility that she had feelings for him, he couldn't help but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wonder.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At Amane's question, Mahiru gaze wandered upward as if she was giving it a bit of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought herself, then, without any change to her expression, answered, "My own selfsatisfaction. There's nothing more to it. It's just as easy for me to cook for two people<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as it is for one, and I guess I simply like treating people."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So it's because you like to cook?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, there's that, too. I think it's also because I can give you food without you getting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    any weird ideas, and you'll genuinely tell me that my cooking's tasty without any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ulterior motives. Plus, it's satisfying for me because I was concerned after seeing your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eating habits."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Is that how it is?" Amane pressed, just the slightest bit disappointed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's how it is. So don't worry about it. Just think of it as… a sudden bout of good<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fortune."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, ma'am."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't seem like she was going to give him any more of an answer than that,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and after bowing courteously, she said "Pardon me" and returned to her own apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I guess that's how it goes," Amane mumbled to himself. "I still don't think it's right for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her to give it to me for free, though." He opened the door back into his own place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Who was it?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My neighbor. She gave me some of her dinner. I'm gonna put it in the fridge, so don't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    restart the game without me," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, sorry, I already beat the boss."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You gotta be kidding me."<p></p>

    7 The Angel’s Injury and a Show of Gratitude<p></p>
    Every day on his way home, Amane passed the park where he and Mahiru had properly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    met for the first time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The building where Amane lived was less of a family-use apartment complex and more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    aimed at single people and couples, so there were few children around, and the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    surrounding apartment buildings were much the same.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Tucked away and out of sight, the little park close to Amane's building was often<p></p>
    <p></p>
    deserted. It was in that little park devoid of children, Amane saw Mahiru for the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    second time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What are you doing in a place like this?" he asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Nothing." Mahiru was sitting on a bench with straight posture and didn't budge at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all even after she recognized Amane and looked him over.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In contrast to the first time the two had met there, this time they were already<p></p>
    <p></p>
    acquainted and were on speaking terms. That had made it easier for Amane to call to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, but the girl's voice had still been stiff when she answered. It didn't seem like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was on guard, as she had been during their first encounter. This was something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    different. Amane could tell that Mahiru was being careful not to let something show<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on her face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, if it was nothing, you wouldn't be sitting here making that face. Did<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something happen?" Amane inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Not really…" Mahiru looked, as she had before when she was on the swing in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rainstorm, like she was lost and didn't know what to do. Seeing her like that worried<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane, but Mahiru didn't seem keen to speak on the matter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though he was bound by their tacit promise not to interact outside their apartments,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hadn't been able to help calling out to Mahiru when he'd seen her all alone in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the park again. Mahiru, for her part, probably did not much want to talk to him; her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression was stiff and blank.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought it was fine if the girl wasn't feeling up to talking, when he noticed that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there were a number of white hairs stuck to her blazer. "You have some hair stuck to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    your uniform; were you playing with a dog or a cat?" he asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wasn't playing. I just helped a cat that was stranded up a tree get back down," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What a total cliche … Ah, I get it now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wait right there. Don't you dare move."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had finally realized just why Mahiru was sitting there alone on the bench. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sighed and dashed off. He was certain that Mahiru would do as he had asked and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would not go anywhere. Actually, it would have been more appropriate to say that she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couldn't go anywhere.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Muttering to himself about how Mahiru chose the strangest times to act tough, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bought a compress and medical tape from the neighborhood drugstore, along with a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cup of ice normally used for iced coffee from a convenience store. When Amane at last<p></p>
    <p></p>
    returned to the park, he found Mahiru sitting on the bench, just as he'd expected. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hadn't so much as shifted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shiina, take off your tights."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He gave a direct order, and she answered in an extremely cold voice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I know it's kind of sudden… Look, I'll put my blazer over you and turn around,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so take the tights off. We need to ice the injury and put a compress on it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As expected, Mahiru was none too happy at being ordered to take off her tights, so by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    way of explanation, Amane waved the bag full of medical supplies.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's face understandably tightened. "…How did you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You had one of your loafers off, and that ankle seemed slightly swollen. Plus, you didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    try to stand up. It really is a total cliche to sprain your ankle while rescuing a cat."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, be quiet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah. Now, take off your tights and give me your foot."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was something anyone would have known just from looking, but Mahiru was making<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a sour face, perhaps because she hadn't expected him to notice that she was hurt.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Obediently, Mahiru accepted Amane's blazer and put it over her knees, so it seemed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like she was going to listen to what he was saying.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane turned his back to Mahiru, put the ice from the cup he had bought at the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    convenience store into a plastic bag, and poured water over it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After he tied the top shut so it wouldn't spill out, he wrapped it loosely in a hand towel<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he kept in his backpack, making an impromptu ice pack. Then he turned around<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slowly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had done as he had asked and removed her tights, exposing her bare legs. They<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were slender and smooth—and looked soft even as she tensed up. The unnatural<p></p>
    <p></p>
    swelling around her ankle was evident.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it's not that badly swollen, but it could get worse if you move it too much. First<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of all, this is going to be cold, but let's ice it for a bit. Once the pain goes away a little,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'll put a compress on, so take it easy," Amane explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "From now on, just ask for my help. It's not like you'll owe me or anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If anything, it's the opposite—I want to pay you back in some small way for everything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you've done for me, so I'd appreciate if you would let me solve one or two problems for you.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru sported her usual expression. Still, she didn't argue with Amane and quietly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    let him ice her ankle while her leg was propped up on the bench.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Has the pain gotten any better?" Amane asked after a moment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yeah, a bit," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, I'm putting the compress on, so… don't get mad at me for being a perv or a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    groper or something, okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wouldn't say something so rude to the person helping me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good to hear."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Stressing that he had absolutely no untoward thoughts, Amane squatted down next to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's leg and stuck a compress on her swollen, red ankle.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane initially asked about the level of pain, it sounded like the sort of thing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    where Mahiru could still stand and walk, but moving risked agitating the sprain<p></p>
    <p></p>
    further, so she was better off sitting here quietly. As long as she stayed off it, it would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably remain a minor injury.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had just finished sticking on the compress and was securing it with medical<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tape when he noticed Mahiru staring intently down at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're surprisingly skillful with that," she commented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I can do first aid. Still can't cook, though." Amane shrugged, acting a little silly,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and Mahiru let out a small laugh. He was glad to see her taut expression relax some,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even if it was only a tiny bit. Reassured by Mahiru's slightly softened attitude, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pulled the pants of his gym uniform from his backpack.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here," he said, handing them to Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't make that face at me; I don't like it. Anyway, your legs are exposed, right? And<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it's not like you can put your tights back on with the compress stuck to you. Relax, I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    haven't worn them."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It would be bad to let her put her tights back on over her swollen ankle, especially now<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that it had medical tape wrapped around it. Since it looked so painful, Amane figured<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru could wear his gym pants, both as protection from the cold and to stop anyone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from seeing her underwear.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed to understand that he was just trying to be considerate, and so she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slipped the pants on.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane snatched up his blazer and handed Mahiru the parka he'd been wearing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here, wear this," he told her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wait, but why?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do you want to be seen being carried?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Letting Mahiru walk on her ankle was a bad idea. Amane had been planning to bring<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her home from the start. They were both headed to the same place, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, sorry, but could you put my backpack on?" Amane asked. "I can't carry you on my<p></p>
    <p></p>
    back if I'm wearing it, obviously."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is there an option where you don't carry me?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look here, your ankle is twisted, so you need to rest it. No one's around, and I've got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    perfectly good legs, so please put them to use."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your legs?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What, you'd prefer my arms? Would you rather I support you from the side?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you even strong enough to carry me all that way?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you making fun of me?… Well, I'm actually not that confident."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane knew he could support Mahiru if she leaned on him, but honestly, it would be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quite difficult to fully carry her all the way back to the apartment complex. What's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more, it would be sure to attract a lot of attention, which Amane preferred to avoid.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He knew that Mahiru had been poking fun when she'd brought up his strength, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smiled, glad she was feeling well enough to crack jokes like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look, if you're game, put the hood up and wear my backpack. After you get on my back,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    take your own bag, too, while you're at it. I won't be able to hold it if I'm supporting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you," Amane instructed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Sorry," Mahiru muttered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm telling you: It's fine. It wouldn't be very manly of me to leave an injured person<p></p>
    <p></p>
    behind and go home—or to make you walk."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane crouched down and turned away from her, and Mahiru timidly leaned onto<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was wearing Amane's parka, so she had on even more clothes than normal,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but even so, he could feel her body pressed against him, slim and willowy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After confirming that Mahiru's arms were secured around his neck without choking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him, Amane stood up slowly, carrying the injured girl on his back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I knew it; she's so light, Amane thought. He wondered if he should be the one worrying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about her diet instead of the other way around. It was more likely that she was just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    naturally petite, though; that was probably all it was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru smelled slightly sweet, and though Amane could tell all sorts of things about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    how anxious she was feeling based on how tightly she clung to him, he headed for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    home without showing it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A few people did stare at the sight of a guy carrying someone on his back, but Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had completely covered her face with the hood of his parka, so Amane wasn't too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    worried about what little attention was being paid to them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, here we are." Amane carried Mahiru as far as her front door, then let her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down and quickly turned to leave without interfering any further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Mahiru could get around on her own while leaning on a wall, Amane guessed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that her injury was probably not all that serious. Thankfully, it was Friday, so Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had plenty of time to rest her ankle and get back on her feet with no problems.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't need dinner tonight, so you should rest. If you like, I could bring you some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nutritional supplements," Amane offered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm fine. I have some stuff prepared," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's good. See ya."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was the most important thing: that food wouldn't be a problem. It was essential<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Mahiru be able to keep still and rest. Amane watched her open the lock on her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    front door, and he, too, took out his apartment key.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Um," started Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane heard the girl's voice and turned around, he saw that she was looking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up at him timidly, clutching her bag to her chest. She looked somewhat troubled, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as he tilted his head in confusion, she seemed to regain her resolve and looked straight<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into his eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you for what you did today. You really saved me," Mahiru admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine, really. I just did it because I wanted to. Take care." Embarrassed by the notion<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of Mahiru fretting over his help, Amane quickly dismissed the thought from his mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After Mahiru gave him a quick nod, Amane turned to unlock his own door. It was only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    then that Amane realized that Mahiru was still wearing his parka and athletic pants,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but he was sure she would return them another day, so he slipped into his apartment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    without saying anything.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Damn, dude, you so healthy that you wear shorts year-round now?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's melancholy in Monday's gym class had less to do with his lack of athletic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    talent and more to do with the fact that he was wearing knee-length jersey shorts<p></p>
    <p></p>
    during an unpleasantly cold season. Everyone else had already switched to their<p></p>
    <p></p>
    winter gym uniforms, but Amane stood out from all the rest, his legs bare below the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    knee.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "As if. I just forgot my pants."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Idiot."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hadn't seen Mahiru over the weekend, and she still had his gym pants, but he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couldn't tell Itsuki that, so there was nothing to do but say that he forgot. He had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    resigned himself to the inevitable mockery, though when Itsuki slapped his back,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cackling with laughter, Amane still found it in himself to slap him back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane let out a soft sigh as he watched Itsuki groan quietly. Then his gaze shifted. At<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the moment, the boys were practicing their high jumps, and the girls were using the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    other side of the field. What's more, since two classes of students were using the field<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at once, it was fairly crowded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The girls were practicing different track-and-field events, so between taking turns, the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girls had plenty of time to watch Amane's class.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do your best, Kadowaki!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Usually, the boys and girls took gym class in different places on campus; with the girls<p></p>
    <p></p>
    present, the boys were getting all worked up. The girls, on the other hand, all spent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    their time watching Amane's most popular classmate, the handsome Yuuta Kadowaki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had never really talked to him before, but he was nice to everyone and was a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    great student, and on top of that, he was the ace of the track club despite being only a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    first-year. Everyone knew he was popular with the girls. Amane figured Yuuta must<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have won some kind of karmic lottery. A lot of the other boys didn't care for him as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much, and there were always a lot of sulky looks when he was around.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh wow, looks like Yuuta's as popular as always," Itsuki observed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Looks that way," Amane answered dully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't seem too interested," Itsuki prodded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it's not like we're friends or anything; we've barely ever spoken. So why should<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I care?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't as though Yuuta was mean or ever messed with Amane. They had nothing to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    do with each other, so Amane honestly did not care. He knew that he was in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    minority there, but he couldn't bring himself to envy Yuuta the same way all the other<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boys did. More specifically, Amane knew that Yuuta was so far out of his league that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    envying him was pointless.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Typical Amane. What, you don't get jealous now?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, should I be like 'Wow, I'm sooo jealous of his populaaarity,' huh?" Amane mocked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That was pretty good." Itsuki guffawed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane looked over at Yuuta, who was wearing a brilliant smile and basking in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feminine adoration. Even Amane had to admit that Yuuta's athletic body and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    handsome face made him look just like a prince. In fact, some girls had taken to calling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Yuuta rewarded the girls' passionate gazes and shrill voices with another radiant<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smile and waved back at them. He really knew how to cultivate a following.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, he sure is popular, no arguing with that," admitted Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know. The other guys can't contain their jealousy," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ha-ha. But the girls are real energetic, too." Itsuki only had eyes for his girlfriend,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose. He had no interest in other girls, so he saw the Yuuta issue as everyone else's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    problem. Chitose wasn't the least bit interested in Yuuta, so Itsuki probably didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    spend much energy thinking about him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    We've got a prince and an angel… This school has a lot of people with cringey nicknames.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Come to think of it, I wonder if Mahiru the angel ended up getting enough rest. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hadn't seen her leave her apartment over the weekend. It was good she was resting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    comfortably, but he still wondered about the state of her injury.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane stealthily scanned the field with his eyes. His class was sharing the field with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's, so she should've been there. Without too much effort, Amane spotted her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even in a crowd, the angel was easy to pick out. She hadn't changed into gym clothes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and wasn't practicing with the rest of her class. Evidently, she was sitting out today.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was sure that he was not the only boy staring at Mahiru, who sat there looking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    small and quiet. Though they were far away from each other, their eyes met suddenly,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and when Amane shifted his gaze around awkwardly, he saw a small smile pass over<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's lips. Since she was looking toward Amane, that meant she was also looking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    toward the rest of the boys. Each of Amane's classmates took the smile for their own,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nearly inciting a riot.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did she just smile at me?!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way; must be me!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "This is our chance! We've gotta impress her!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The prince is hogging the spotlight."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    To think that Mahiru could cause such excitement with just one meager smile… Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't know whether it was because she was that amazing or because the boys were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all that simple.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Buncha morons," Itsuki muttered. He'd apparently been thinking the same thing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane chuckled. "Well, if we don't wanna fail gym class, we'd better get moving, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What's that, Amane? The angel's heavenly gaze got you all riled up, too?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, nothing like that. I told you, I'm not interested."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, guess I'll drop it, then. Since you don't care and all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki seemed like he was about to start boasting about how great girlfriends are,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    likely citing his own personal experience, but Amane was quick to brush him off.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah," he said. He spared one more glance in Mahiru's direction and smiled<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wryly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you for what you did the other day. Here's your parka and sweatpants back."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That evening, when Mahiru brought him his portion of dinner, she was carrying a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    paper bag in addition to the plastic container. Amane could see at a glance that the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    parka and pants he had loaned her a few days ago were folded neatly in the bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm. How's the ankle?" he asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The pain is already mostly gone. I've decided not to do any exercise until it's completely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    healed," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's for the best. Looks like you're sitting out gym class, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had decided to play it safe and not participate in gym, and Amane figured it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was probably the right thing to do. Her ankle didn't look like it was hurting her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anymore, but she still slightly favored that leg when she walked, indicating that it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not yet entirely healed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane was nodding at the girl's sensible decision, he thought back on the day's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gym class and smiled suddenly. "You know, you're really amazing, Miss Angel. With a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    single smile, all the boys were practically bursting with excitement."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I told you to stop calling me that… And it's not as if I like that kind of attention. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really bothers me, you know," Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, who wouldn't get fired up when a beautiful person looks at them? You know,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the girls started shrieking today, too, when Kadowaki waved at them."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Kadowaki… oh, that super-popular guy?" Mahiru didn't seem to be too interested in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the prince. Actually, it seemed like she didn't even recognize his name. Amane had to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    describe him a bit before Mahiru realized who he was talking about.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Yuuta wasn't as popular as the angel, but he was a fairly well-known boy in their grade,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so Amane was surprised that she didn't know who he was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're not interested in him?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not particularly. We're in different classes, and we've never really spoken," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm. The other girls go bananas for him, though. They can't get enough of the cool<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dude."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, he does have a handsome face. But we don't talk; we don't have any connection.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So I don't really care."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're so candid about things like that," Amane observed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if looks are so important, don't you think it's strange that you don't like me?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asked Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, so you do realize how beautiful you are?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was quite right in what she said. Beauty could be the spark that ignited greater<p></p>
    <p></p>
    affections, but it was rarely the sole source of love. Amane agreed with that, just as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    agreed that Mahiru was very pretty. It was certainly a surprise to hear her say that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself, though.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know that, objectively speaking, I'm considered very attractive, and I do work hard<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to maintain my appearance. It's only natural. Given how often people make a big deal<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about my looks, I can tell what they think of me even if I don't want to know." Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't seem to be boasting in the least.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was certainly being honest about how much effort she spent on her appearance.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had always had a good-looking face, but clearly she was not content to coast<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by on natural good looks. Her hair was like a radiant halo, befitting her angelic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nickname, and the luster of her skin was also always perfect, without a single blemish.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her hands didn't get chapped, even when she was doing housework, and even her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fingernails were beautifully polished. The gentle curves of her body spoke to a wellbalanced figure that had likely taken some effort to cultivate.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm going to say something straight up, so don't get mad at me…," Amane began, "but…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you don't seem to be embarrassed by all this praise."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'd get annoyed before I'd get embarrassed if someone wouldn't stop flattering me,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru answered curtly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Guess being beautiful has its own struggles."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Still, beauty does have its advantages, so I suppose I shouldn't complain."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You say that like you wouldn't know…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What? Would you rather I bashfully say 'Oh, no, that's not true!'?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, as someone who knows what you're really like, that would be weird."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Exactly. Honestly, I don't see the point in putting on an act like that in front of you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Glad to hear it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had only recently dropped her public persona around Amane, so if she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    changed back now… Amane could feel goosebumps prickling at the thought of facing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the distant angel he saw at school rather than the girl he was gradually getting to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    know.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In the end, things between the two of them remained as they were.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane looked at the food container he'd been handed. There was actually more food<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than usual. The container was packed with several side dishes, each one a large<p></p>
    <p></p>
    portion. Rather than leftovers, it was more like Amane had been handed a fancy boxed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lunch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Today's quite the smorgasbord," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Because you took such good care of me," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I told you not to worry about that… Oh, there are croquettes in here!" Amane could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    never say no to croquettes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Croquettes were frequently sold a la carte but could be a big pain to make yourself. As<p></p>
    <p></p>
    such, you could consider them the pinnacle of home cooking. After steaming potatoes,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mashing them, stirring in saute ed beef, onions, and more, and then forming the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    patties, you had to completely chill them, then add batter and fry them. It was a very<p></p>
    <p></p>
    involved process. Even Amane, who rarely cooked anything, had watched his mother<p></p>
    <p></p>
    make croquettes and had decided never to make them himself because they were such<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a pain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I had them already made and chilling, so I only had to fry them," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is that why there's fried chicken, too?" asked Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Living alone, Amane didn't get to eat a lot of fried dishes, so he was grateful for the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    handmade food. Of course, they were best when they were freshly made, while the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    coating was still nice and crispy, served with hot rice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Sometime, I'd like to try them straight out of the oil," Amane muttered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had packed the fried chicken into the container after letting it cool, perhaps<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for hygienic reasons. So no matter what, Amane would need to warm the food back<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up. Though fried foods could be restored to a crispy texture via a toaster oven, it still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't the same as eating the stuff fresh. Amane had no doubts that Mahiru's cooking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would still be delicious, of course, but it would probably be even better right from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pan.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hadn't meant to whisper what he had been thinking; his desire had simply<p></p>
    <p></p>
    leaked from his lips. Unfortunately, he'd said it loud enough that Mahiru raised her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eyebrows a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you inviting me over?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not what I'm saying at all! It's already too presumptuous of me to share your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    meals." Amane hadn't meant it that way at all, and he shrugged and vehemently denied<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru brought a hand to her mouth and directed her gaze downward. She seemed to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be mulling something over and did not make eye contact with Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Your share," she finally said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Let me cook at your place, and we can consider that as part of paying for your share<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of the food expenses."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's sudden proposition left Amane's mouth hanging open in shock.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The accidental mention about eating the fried foods fresh had been more of a sardonic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wish than anything else. That Mahiru had actually considered and agreed to it left<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane completely bewildered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Normally, who would think of going into the home of some boy they didn't know all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that well to cook dinner? Maybe it would be more efficient to cook at his place rather<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than bring the food over after, but he was a member of the opposite sex, and it wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like they were close friends. Wouldn't doing that make Mahiru uneasy?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You definitely don't need to do that; I've already received way more than I could ask<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for, way more than I deserve… Aren't you worried about your safety?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you try anything, I'll crush you. Hard. No mercy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ack, you're scary! I felt a chill."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I don't suppose it will come to that. You already know what the risks are, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I've decided you won't do anything. You know how popular I am at school, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Even supposing I did try something, it'd be the end of me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was vastly more popular than Amane, and on top of that, everyone saw her as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this delicate girl, so if word got around that Amane had so much as thought about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doing anything inappropriate to her, he was sure he'd never be able to set foot on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school grounds again. Amane was not so foolish or so unprincipled as to try something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    knowing that it would mean, at best, social ruin. He wasn't interested anyway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Besides…," Mahiru added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Besides?" Amane asked, urging her to continue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're not even the right type for someone like me," Mahiru asserted with a straight<p></p>
    <p></p>
    face, then suddenly smiled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And what if I was your type?" Amane pressed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "First of all, I believe you were the one who insisted on talking to me. And then wanted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nothing to do with me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And that won you over?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, it told me that you're harmless enough," Mahiru explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, thanks, I guess."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whether that was a good thing or not, Amane couldn't deny it was true. After all, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had never had any intention of doing anything with Mahiru in the first place. One thing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was certain, however: Amane was not going to pass up the chance to enjoy a freshly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    made meal. He accepted the title of harmless guy and gained the privilege of sharing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dinner.<p></p>

    8 The First Meal Together<p></p>
    Mahiru was going to start cooking dinner at Amane's apartment, and she presented<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him with a list of conditions:<p></p>
    <p></p>
    • Amane would pay for half the cost of ingredients, plus an additional labor cost, plus<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the cost of any incidental expenses.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    • The two of them would each contact the other no later than the day before if they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had something to do and couldn't eat together.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    • They would divide the work of shopping and cleaning up afterward.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Regarding the extra labor cost, it had taken some work to get Mahiru to agree to it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had insisted that he felt bad about all the time she was spending on him. It was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to be expected, since she did all the work making the food. Aside from that, though,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane and Mahiru had come to an agreement rather quickly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    And so, the day after their agreement had been ratified, Mahiru came over early holding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    supermarket bags in both hands and made preparations to start cooking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's really all brand-new, like it's hardly been used…," Mahiru commented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up," Amane shot back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A beautiful girl stood in his kitchen, and she was wearing an apron. This was like a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fantasy come to life. Amane was sure he was going to lose it any second now. When<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru pointed out, yet again, that he had really never used his kitchen, he felt a deep<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shame.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You've got an impressive collection of gadgets here, but they're like pearls tossed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before swine," Mahiru observed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if you use them, they won't go to waste," Amane reasoned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's a poor excuse, after the fact. Your precious cookware is practically dying from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    neglect."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right then, bring it back to life with your amazing culinary talents. I sure as hell<p></p>
    <p></p>
    can't."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With gracious concession, Amane motioned for Mahiru to take over. She returned the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gesture with an exasperated expression, but perhaps because she'd expected as much,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she just sighed and didn't complain further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, let's get started. Do you have any spices?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course I do; are you making fun of me? They're all properly stored—and none are<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expired, either."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wow, I'm surprised."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's because they've never been opened."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's nothing to brag about. All right, if you don't have what we need, I can bring<p></p>
    <p></p>
    things over from my place to use this once."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That would be helpful."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For now, if you have the basics, I think we can make do. Also, I decided on today's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dishes already; is that all right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't know much about cooking, so I'm happy with anything as long as I get to eat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I don't have strong preferences."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Really? Then let's hurry up and get started… Please show me where you keep<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "In this basket."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "They're really unopened, huh…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru raised her eyebrows in shock as she stared at the basket filled with untouched<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seasonings. Perhaps because she'd been warned before she'd seen the unused spices,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she quickly reassumed her usual demeanor and began washing her hands at the sink.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, I'm going to start making stuff, so you can go wait in the living room or in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    your bedroom," Mahiru declared.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay. I can't help you with anything anyway," Amane accepted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What a gentleman. I suppose you'd just get in the way if you hung around."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're awfully honest."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's just the truth. There's no need to sugarcoat it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Mahiru said, he would clearly just be in the way, so Amane obediently returned to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the living room and watched her back as she worked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When she had finished washing her hands, Mahiru quickly set to work. Amane didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    know what she was making, but based on the ingredients she had readied, it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably Japanese food.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Everything about this felt strange to Amane, like he was in a dream, but it was real.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was actually preparing the ingredients right there, her hair tied up in a gently<p></p>
    <p></p>
    swaying ponytail.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What's with this situation? It's like I've got a wife or something, Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru probably didn't feel the same way, but their setup looked a little too much like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they were a happy family, and Amane couldn't help but imagine it. He didn't have even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the smallest desire to live with Mahiru, but the sight of a beautiful girl standing in his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kitchen was in itself enough to send his mind to all sorts of places. Whether or not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there was any affection between Amane and Mahiru, just having a lovely girl treat him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to a home-cooked meal was enough to touch Amane's heart.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Are you thinking weird things over there?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can stop with the strange speculations."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had frozen when Mahiru called him out. She'd guessed what he was thinking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    without even turning around.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She sure is sharp…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Feeling amazed and anxious all at once, Amane stamped down on the not-quite-evil<p></p>
    <p></p>
    base instincts that had begun welling up inside him and returned to staring at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    About an hour later, Mahiru began setting out completed dishes on the table.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She'd chosen to make Japanese food today, which was typical when one considered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her penchant for healthy cooking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It turns out you have quite a few utensils and seasonings, so it looks like I won't have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to bring anything from my place. Starting tomorrow, I can try more elaborate dishes,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, I'm just grateful you're making anything for me," Amane admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Perhaps because Mahiru hadn't known how many pieces of cookware and seasonings<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had in his collection, she had made many simple dishes rather than anything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more intricate, but the presentation was flawless nonetheless.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Lined up along the table was an array of Japanese-style dishes. From fish simmered in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    soy sauce to dressed greens. From rolled omelets to miso soup. Every last item was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something Amane could never dream of making himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Previously, Amane had said he didn't have any particular likes or dislikes, but he did<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in fact love Japanese food. He wanted to reassure Mahiru, who looked apologetic for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    having only prepared easy recipes, that this was exactly what he had wanted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It looks amazing," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm happy to hear you say that. Eat up while it's still hot."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru sat down in a chair next to her, so Amane took a seat across the table.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His dining table was small, since he lived alone, so no matter how they sat, they were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    still close together. It was lucky that Amane happened to have two chairs just in case<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a guest stopped by, but seeing a beautiful girl sitting right before his eyes evoked some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    indescribable feeling from within him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once Amane set upon the food, however, even Mahiru's beauty ceased to matter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Hurriedly, he said "Let's eat" and started with the miso soup.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The moment he brought the bowl to his lips and took a sip, the fragrant miso and the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    flavor of the dashi spread through his mouth. The gentle taste was so completely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    different from instant miso soup. Amane could tell that it must have been prepared<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with great care. The miso flavor wasn't overpowering, and it was thoughtfully<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seasoned to allow the taste of the dashi broth to come through.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At first, Amane felt that the soup's taste was just a little bit strong, but after he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    considered drinking it while eating the other dishes, he realized that it struck the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    perfect balance and knew he would empty his bowl. Rather than being overwhelming,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the miso soup was a comforting flavor. It was a taste that made you want to eat more.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Delicious," Amane said with sincerity.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you for saying so." Mahiru's eyes crinkled in a relieved smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been complimenting Mahiru's cooking for a while, but she'd probably been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feeling nervous with this being the first time she'd cooked right in front of him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru watched Amane for a few moments before eating anything herself. Once she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    finally did start digging in, Amane extended his chopsticks toward the other dishes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sampling a bit of each dish, it came as no surprise to Amane that everything Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had prepared was fantastic.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The simmered fish was bursting with juicy flavor without sacrificing its tenderness.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Usually when fish was cooked for a long time to bring out the taste, it would naturally<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lose some moisture and dry out, but this one was plump and had a nice texture.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As for the rolled omelets, they were tailored exactly to Amane's tastes. They were an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enticingly vivid yellow, and when Amane stuffed one in his mouth, he was unsurprised<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by the gentle seasoning of dashi that greeted him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When it came to Japanese-style omelets, Amane knew, some people added sugar when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    making them, while others only used salt. These rolled ones had been flavored with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dashi, however. In addition to the rich taste of the dashi, Amane could also taste a faint<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sweetness. He wondered if that light undertone came from honey. There probably<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't that much in the rolled omelets, but the satisfying hint of sweetness brought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out a real depth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had no real preference between sweet or salty when it came to egg dishes, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the ones he liked best combined the complex flavor of dashi with what he suspected<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was a bit of honey. Mahiru had accomplished that expertly, and Amane found himself<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quite impressed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Quietly muttering that the rolled omelets were delicious, Amane grabbed another one<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with his chopsticks and quickly tossed it in his mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Not only had they been perfectly flavored, they'd been skillfully cooked as well. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stock added to the eggs made them extra juicy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    These are definitely better than Mom's rolled omelets. He kept rude thoughts about his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nonpresent mother to himself as he smacked his lips happily. Then he realized that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was staring at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You really seem to be enjoying it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Because it's all so good. I'm paying my respects to the delicious food."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure, all right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Besides, doesn't it feel better when I'm honest about how much I enjoy it rather than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sitting here eating with a blank expression?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If you think something's delicious, you've got to really act like it, otherwise, the person<p></p>
    <p></p>
    who made it will be left wondering. Even if you say you enjoy it, who would believe you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    if you didn't look the part? It's better to be honest and just let how you feel show directly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on your face. Whether you're the one giving thanks or being thanked, it's best to do what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feels good.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yes, I suppose so…" Mahiru seemed to understand what Amane was saying, and she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smiled slightly. It was a gentle expression, and it betrayed just a hint of relief. It was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sweet enough that all of Amane's thoughts ground to a halt for a second.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Fujimiya?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah… no, it's nothing," Amane replied. He'd been enchanted by the angel's smile, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he couldn't possibly tell her that. To conceal his growing embarrassment, Amane took<p></p>
    <p></p>
    another bite of food, ending any further discussion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you for dinner."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm glad you liked it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had completely devoured every dish Mahiru had laid out. Mahiru's words had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been calm, but her expression was serene, and she seemed happy that Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    packed everything into his stomach. Not a single grain of rice had been left behind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It was delicious," Amane complimented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I could tell that much just by watching you," Mahiru quipped dryly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Better than my mom's cooking."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I hear it's taboo to compare a girl's cooking to your mother's."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Isn't that only true when you're criticizing someone? Anyway, does that bother you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't mind, no."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well then, it's fine, right? It doesn't change the fact that it's delicious."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was clearly no amateur cook. Amane's mother probably had more years of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    experience under her belt, but she preferred different tastes, and many of her dishes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were fairly bland, so they were no match for Mahiru's carefully concocted foods.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Man, this is so awesome. To be able to eat like that every night!" exclaimed Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "As long as I don't have anything else going on, that is," Mahiru added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…So I can really host you every night for dinner?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wouldn't have suggested it if I was against the idea."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I guess that's true."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was a straight shooter, so of course she would've never agreed to it if she didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want to in the first place. Amane still wasn't sure if it was okay to have her cooking for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him like this so often, however.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was paying for half the ingredients, plus a bit extra to cover her labor, but even so,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he couldn't help feeling like the burden on Mahiru was too large.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Do you normally cook for boys you don't even like?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm doing it because you were neglecting your health. Besides, I enjoy the act of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooking itself, and I don't hate seeing you eat it with such gusto."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But…," Amane started.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If it bothers you that much, it would be no problem to stop."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, please, I'm begging you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At the first sign of Mahiru possibly not cooking for him anymore, Amane instantly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    retracted any and all complaints. That was just how much her food meant to him. To<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have it snatched away now—it would practically be a matter of life and death.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was entirely aware that Mahiru had gained full control of him by way of his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stomach, but Mahiru's cooking was just too delicious to refuse. Returning to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    convenience-store meals now would be like robbing the world of color.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shocked at Amane's immediate reply, Mahiru was stunned for a moment before<p></p>
    <p></p>
    breaking into a smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well then, please continue to enjoy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It appeared that Amane's days of dining with the extremely charitable angel who made<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all the food by hand would continue for a while yet. Amane couldn't help but sigh from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    happiness, guilt, and anticipation.<p></p>

    9 The Angel’s Birthday<p></p>
    "Amaneee, how'd you do?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Semester exams had finally ended. Having survived their collective hell, the students<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gathered in their classroom, more exited and animated than usual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane and Itsuki, both relieved that they had wrapped up all their tests, were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    comparing their performances.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm? Oh, pretty average," Amane answered. "Not that great, not that bad."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The exam had covered the expected material, so for anyone who studied daily, it wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that difficult. Amane had done about as well this time as he had with other tests,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    leaving little to say about his academics one way or the other.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane got bored easily, but he nevertheless always made sure to study. He was able<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to retain most of the things taught in class, but it was far too difficult to get a perfect<p></p>
    <p></p>
    score, so his scores usually floated between a solid eighty and ninety.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I bet you'll make it into the top thirty, if you didn't outdo yourself… you egghead,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki teased.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's because I study every day," Amane shot back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, how nice for you!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't start; you're the one forgetting to study 'cause you're too busy flirting."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The difference between Amane and Itsuki probably had less to do with their intellectual<p></p>
    <p></p>
    capacities and more to do with which one of them spent all their free time with a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certain girlfriend named Chitose. Itsuki had the ability to make it into a pretty high<p></p>
    <p></p>
    score bracket if he ever bothered to study seriously, but since Chitose was his real<p></p>
    <p></p>
    priority, his actual rank was much lower than Amane's.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Girlfriends are great, you know?" Itsuki said wistfully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, Amane, you should get a girlfriend, too!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If guys could just get girlfriends whenever they wanted, the men of the world<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wouldn't shed so many bitter tears."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There were plenty of unsatisfied men who would have taken offense at Itsuki's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thoughtless remark. Amane, though, wasn't really inclined to get angry with him over<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it. In fact, he'd never really felt that way about any girl, so he was content to let the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    comment pass.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Assuming I did get one, what then?" Amane inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A double date," Itsuki replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That would end in a bad case of heartburn for my fictional girlfriend and me. We'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have to break up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You could flirt in front of us, too, y'know!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do you really think I can find a girlfriend, the way I live?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I guess it's impossible."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was honest to a fault, even with himself. He'd always found other people difficult<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and exhausting, and he was aware that many people found him to be standoffish. That,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    plus the blunt way he spoke, meant he was not all that popular. Amane's social status<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would've made it hard to find a girlfriend, even if he was looking for one.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Against all odds, if Amane did somehow find a girlfriend, he was sure they wouldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be like Itsuki and Chitose. He couldn't picture himself flirting in public with a girl,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    oblivious to anyone who might see.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, you should at least find someone you like, Amane. If you just cut your bangs<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a little shorter, cleaned yourself up, and maybe found a style that worked for you, the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girls would definitely look at you differently, I'm tellin' ya."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Assuming Amane's self-evaluation was accurate, he didn't have the handsome looks<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of a pretty boy like Yuuta or a Romeo like Itsuki, but he definitely didn't think he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ugly, either. Amane figured that if he just spent more time on his grooming and paid<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more attention to his clothes, he could rival most of the other boys his age. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    problem was that he didn't know enough about fashion to dress well, and he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certainly not smooth enough with his words to win any girl over.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not interested in the kind of girl who picks a date based on appearance," Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asserted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You say that, but if you don't get them interested in the first place, you won't even get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to know them well enough to judge their personality, right?" Itsuki argued back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Even if that's true, I'm not really looking for a girlfriend right now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Were some hypothetical girl ever actually interested in Amane, it would be all over the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    second she saw how he lived. Amane was a slob with no life skills, and on top of that,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had a difficult time getting along with other people. If there was a girl who was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    drawn to him, despite all that, he'd like to meet her. Such a hopeless thought was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough to bring a bitter smile to Amane's face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Besides, since Mahiru was cooking dinners for him now, a girlfriend could introduce<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some unpleasant complications. Not that Amane intended to pursue a relationship in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the first place, but that was simply one more strike against the idea.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt that Mahiru's delicious cooking was worth more than the possibility of an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as-yet-unseen girlfriend, and that conviction was not likely to be easily overturned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ugh, you're so boring… How about I get Chi to introduce you to one of her friends?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    offered Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You care way too much about this. Most of Chi's friends are too… excitable. It's hard<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for me to hang out with them, even as friends." Amane quickly shot down the idea.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Only because you're so gloomy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if you say so, I won't say anything to her for now. But as a blossoming high school<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boy, isn't it sad to live an empty life, all by yourself?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't need a girlfriend; they're too much trouble."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just what do you think we're supposed to be doing at school anyway? Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even if he wasn't actually that serious about his studies, he still didn't see the point in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    spending so much time worrying about romance. Above all, finding a real match was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    no easy feat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What a waste," Itsuki grumbled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah." Amane shrugged.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But listen, you'll change your tune when you find a good one, Amane, ya hear?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What makes you so sure?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Because girls particularly like to fuss over guys like you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whatever you say, man."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't imagine acting so sentimental; it didn't seem possible. He decided to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    simply ignore his friend's words. Itsuki was looking at Amane with an exasperated<p></p>
    <p></p>
    glare, when suddenly, his line of sight shifted, and his face relaxed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Itsukiii! Let's go home together!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, Chi!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just then, Chitose appeared. Apparently, Itsuki had promised to walk her home, which<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brought a swift end to their conversation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane turned to see where his friend's attention had shifted, he saw a girl with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    medium-short light-brown hair tinged with red, looking their way with a radiant<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smile. Well, to be more accurate, she was only looking and waving at Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The girl's lively aura and bright, smiling face were enough to make Itsuki beam<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whenever he saw her. That was the kind of effect Chitose had on people, and for better<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or worse, she was always the center of attention.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose was a different type of beauty than Mahiru. She had a great big smile as she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rushed over. With any luck, she wouldn't have much to say today, because usually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whenever Chitose talked, she made fun of Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You agree, right, Chi? Amane's the type of guy who needs a girlfriend to take care of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him, don't you think?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong," chided Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wait, what, do you have a girlfriend, Amane?!" Chitose exclaimed excitedly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Aw, bummer," Chitose said, pouting. "If you did, I'd want to be friends with her."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Knowing your idea of friendship, I would feel bad for my imaginary girlfriend,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, so you have an imaginary girlfriend?" Chitose asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Weren't we just talking about what if I had one?!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Kidding, kidding."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I get tired just talking to you…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's just because you don't have the stamina to handle me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't have the patience, more like…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even a short exchange with Chitose was mentally exhausting for Amane. Most of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    time, he tried to keep his head down and avoid other people, like at school. When he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    found himself forced to carry on a conversation with someone as extroverted as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose, it was really demanding.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose didn't let Amane's sour attitude bother her at all and flashed the exhaustedlooking boy a truly joyful-looking smile. "You're such a mess."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki smiled in the same way and tossed out some perfunctory advice. "You'd better<p></p>
    <p></p>
    get your act together, buddy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was already too worn-out, managing only to let out a deep sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What are you doing?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After returning home and gobbling up Mahiru's handmade food, Amane returned to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the living room once he was finished doing the dishes and saw Mahiru with a question<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sheet spread out before her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There'd been no agreement about cleaning the dishes, but Amane took the initiative<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to shoulder the burden whenever possible. While he'd been tidying up, Mahiru had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gone to sit in the living room. It would have been inexcusable to make her do<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything and then hurry on home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm grading," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, I can see that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She seemed to be reviewing her answers with her textbook out, checking that she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hadn't gotten anything wrong.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So what's the result?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if I didn't make any recording errors on my answer sheet, then it's… a perfect<p></p>
    <p></p>
    score."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can't think of anything to say except 'It figures.'"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just as Mahiru didn't show much of a reaction in regard to her errorless work, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't have a very exaggerated response. He wasn't surprised, because her name was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    practically always written in the top spot of the periodic exam results. He knew Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was more than capable of a perfect score, so he was not the least bit surprised by her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    performance here.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's because studying doesn't bother me. I've actually already completed all of this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    year's coursework, so now it's enough to simply review," Mahiru explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whoa, you really go all out…," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You study a lot yourself, Fujimiya."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You know what my grades are like?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I sort of remember your name in the ranking list."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, Mahiru had known a little bit about Amane before they ever spoke. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    must have noticed him among the top ranks, because she recounted his exact placement<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the most recent test without hesitation, almost like she was looking at the list right<p></p>
    <p></p>
    now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane did work pretty hard at his studies, but it wasn't because of some earnest drive<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for success or anything. It was because of an agreement he'd come to with his parents.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In order to live alone, he had to maintain good grades.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it's a condition for my current lifestyle: I have to keep my grades up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The only other facet to the agreement was that Amane had to visit home at least once<p></p>
    <p></p>
    every six months, but he could take care of that over long school breaks. Basically, as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    long as he was keeping his grades up, there were no problems.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I study hard enough to keep my head above water, but nothing like you. You really put<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a lot of effort in."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I have to try hard," Mahiru mumbled, casting her eyes downward. Her expression<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was hidden by her bangs, and while Amane couldn't get a proper look at it, anyone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would have recognized it wasn't a happy one. Before he could get a read on her, though,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she quickly looked back up, once again wearing her usual expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even if there had been time to point out the curious change, Amane probably wouldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have. He could tell that Mahiru was carrying some kind of painful burden by certain<p></p>
    <p></p>
    things she did or faces she made.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While Amane made sure to never ask Mahiru what was bothering her or what was so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unpleasant, he still got the impression that she was struggling with something. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    imagined that, whatever it was, it had its origins in her home life. It was hardly the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kind of subject he could just casually broach with the girl. He understood that this was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not an area in which an outsider like himself could intrude, and so Amane never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    touched the subject, and he persistently tried to maintain a sense of distance<p></p>
    <p></p>
    appropriate for a neighbor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Everyone had things they didn't want to talk about, even Amane. Treading thoughtlessly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on Mahiru would be rude, and he was sure that she appreciated the fact that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pretended not to notice her distress.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Having disguised her abrupt change in mood, Mahiru declared in a clear voice that she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would be heading back to her own apartment. She put her textbook and her answer<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sheet back into her bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't have any intention of stopping her, so he replied simply "Mm-hmm,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sounds good" and watched Mahiru get ready to leave.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When the angel had finished putting everything away, she stood up from her seat, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane noticed that she'd left something behind next to her empty cup. He picked it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up and discovered it was a case holding Mahiru's student ID, the kind any student<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would have. She'd probably pulled it out along with her textbook and forgotten to put<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Along with her name and picture, the little plastic card displayed common<p></p>
    <p></p>
    information, like her student number, birthday, and blood type. After staring at it for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a second, Amane called out to Mahiru, who was in the entryway and putting her shoes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You forgot this," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, sorry for the trouble. Well then, good night."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Night."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru gave a quick, polite bow and turned her back on Amane's apartment. With a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    small sigh, Amane watched her leave.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thinking back to the birth date listed on Mahiru's school ID, Amane put a hand to his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forehead as he realized something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…That's in four days, isn't it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he hadn't unintentionally seen the girl's ID, he likely never would've found out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wished that he'd known about Mahiru's birthday a little earlier and let out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    another sigh, a deep one.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, I was wondering, is there anything you want?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The following day, Amane tried to see if there was anything Mahiru might like as a gift.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no ulterior motive behind the gesture. In fact, Amane had been thinking for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a while that it might be nice to get something for the girl who had been taking care of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him every day. A birthday seemed like the perfect time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There must have been something odd about the way Amane phrased the question,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    however, because Mahiru gave him a puzzled look. One that made Amane begin to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    regret asking such a direct question.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why are you asking all of the sudden?" Mahiru inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't seem very materialistic, so I was just curious."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Out of nowhere again…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought that he should probably have tried to play it a little smoother, but it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was too late for that now. The one possible saving grace was that Mahiru didn't seem<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to have realized that this was about her birthday. As far as she knew, Amane should've<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had no way of knowing her date of birth. Hopefully, that would keep her from catching<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, let's see, there is one thing I need. I guess that's what I want right now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What do you want?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A whetstone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A… whetstone?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unconsciously, Amane repeated Mahiru's words, because the girl's answer had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    far too unexpected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No one could've expected that kind of answer from a high school girl. Normally, you'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    think they would want cosmetics, or accessories, or bags, or something like that, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought. He would never in his wildest dreams have expected a girl to want a tool for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sharpening metal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's right, a whetstone. I already have several, but I want one with a finer finishing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    surface, you see," Mahiru explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you sure you're really an ordinary high school girl?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Please don't expect me to be ordinary."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was difficult for Amane to object to that. Mahiru could not be called an ordinary high<p></p>
    <p></p>
    schooler, by any standard. Describing her as an angel seemed entirely accurate.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was a prodigy who was good at school and sports. What's more, she was an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    excellent cook and a skilled housekeeper. As if that wasn't enough, Mahiru was a noble<p></p>
    <p></p>
    young lady who spent so much time taking care of a slob like Amane that she could've<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been mistaken for a married woman.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Still, who could have imagined she'd want something like a whetstone?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had to be the only high school girl in the whole world who wanted such a thing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can't buy it yourself?" Amane wondered aloud. She was well-off, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not exactly that I can't buy it, you know. It's just—I won't have that many<p></p>
    <p></p>
    opportunities to use it, and it's pretty expensive. After considering all that, I couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really justify the purchase. I already have one that can put a decent edge on, so I keep<p></p>
    <p></p>
    telling myself that I don't really need it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had to admit that it was more than a bit frightening to know that Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    owned several whetstones already.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…How many high school girls out there sharpen their own kitchen knives?" he asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Quite a few," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Even if there are, you're the only one I know, and you're also the only one who wants<p></p>
    <p></p>
    another whetstone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I suppose it's nice to be unique."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you say so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This certainly was an angel with unusual interests. Amane couldn't make heads or tails<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru tilted her head in confusion as Amane stood there looking baffled. He'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    completely lost sight of his original objective.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, Itsuki?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After completely failing to decide on a gift that Mahiru might appreciate, Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decided instead to consult with his best friend. Itsuki had a way with women's hearts,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as well as a girlfriend to consult, so Amane expected that he would probably have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some grasp on what a girl would normally want. While he wasn't really sure it was a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    good idea to try to apply normal standards to someone like Mahiru, he expected that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she wouldn't outright hate things that made someone else's girlfriend happy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What's up?" Itsuki replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "When you give Chitose presents, what do you usually get her?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought it would be best to start by asking what Itsuki bought for his girl, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all he got back was a blank stare.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, you planning on giving a present to some sweetheart of yours?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do you think I have it in me to do something like that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nope."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, then."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "In that case, why are you asking?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Someone I know has a birthday coming up, so I wanted to ask you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While Amane was planning on listening to Itsuki's advice with the utmost attention,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was also keen not to reveal too much about his own circumstances.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm… for starters, you should try finding out what they want. You know, it's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    important to do that sort of research on a regular basis. It's the secret to a harmonious<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relationship, I'm telling you," said Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I told you that this isn't for a girlfriend," Amane reminded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Setting aside the potential grave danger the other boys at school would pose to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's physical safety if word ever got around, Mahiru was too awe-inspiring to even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    consider asking out in the first place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sure, he was comfortable hanging around with her, and they got along well enough as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    two frank individuals, but there were absolutely no romantic feelings between them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sure, she was cute, but that didn't mean Amane wanted a relationship.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What they want, huh…? And what if you don't know?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Depends on how close you are. If you're good friends, an accessory or something is<p></p>
    <p></p>
    good, but if you're not close, something practical that they can use is a safer bet. There<p></p>
    <p></p>
    are lots of girls who're happy to get flowers but don't know what to do when they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    receive them," Itsuki explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You sure know your stuff."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I've done a fair bit of research, I guess."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki and Chitose hadn't always been so wild about each other. Their relationship had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slowly developed, first starting in middle school. Amane had gone to a different middle<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school, so he didn't really know all the details, but apparently, they'd gone through a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lot together, and their relationship had grown from those experiences to the point<p></p>
    <p></p>
    where these days, they wouldn't shut up about each other.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    To hear him tell it, Itsuki had also been fairly lost the first time he'd had to give Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a present, so Amane figured he could benefit from his friend's experience.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, and no girl hates hand cream," Itsuki added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hand cream?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane was pondering this unexpected option, Itsuki grinned and explained<p></p>
    <p></p>
    proudly, "No matter what age they are, every girl has some use for it. If she's a student,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her hands get dry from handling notebooks and textbooks in class; if she's in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    workforce, her hands dry out from typing and air conditioning; and housewives cook<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and clean, so their hands take a beating, too. You can't go wrong with that stuff."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm. You sure know an awful lot about women's hands…," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're the one who came and asked me!" Itsuki snapped.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki slapped Amane on the back, but there was no power behind it. The two friends<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shared a laugh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Hand cream, huh? I guess that is a pretty safe bet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been taking the initiative on washing the dishes after dinner, but Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    obviously did her own dishes at home, so he could imagine her hands could use some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    moisturizing. More importantly, Amane was sure she took care of her hands already,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    since they were so smooth. A gift she could use right away really was the best plan.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Cool, thanks for your thoughts," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Let's try asking Chi, too. As a fellow girl, she probably has a better idea," proposed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Eh…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You gotta warm up to her."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane certainly didn't hate her, but Chitose was not exactly his favorite type of girl,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and being around her always made him feel awkward. Usually, he tried to avoid<p></p>
    <p></p>
    interacting with her altogether. Itsuki slapped Amane's back again gently, smiling in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    amusement.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whaaa—? Amane, you're giving a girl a birthday present?" Chitose was smiling—no,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smirking—at this rare development, and it was all Amane could do not to grimace.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had gone to Chitose's classroom to talk to her after school, and sure enough, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed greatly amused. Incidentally, Itsuki had sent Chitose a message saying that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't worried about her being alone with another boy as long as it was Amane, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had gone on home. Amane had sighed softly, while Chitose had worn a wide grin.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I told him I didn't want to ask her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was obvious that she was definitely going to pry and ridicule him, so he hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    intended to turn to her for help at all. Amane certainly didn't hate Chitose, but he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couldn't deny that there were some things about her that he just couldn't stand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay, so Itsuki wrote here that 'Amane was hoping you'd give him some pointers.' So<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you want my help, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're the only girl I can ask, Chi."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It doesn't sound very nice when you put it like that, you know." Chitose looked at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane with clear pity, but he let it pass.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The truth was, Amane had no female friends outside of Chitose. Every single girl in his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    class barely counted as acquaintances, and he wasn't close enough to any of them to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be able to ask for help with things like this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Actually, Amane was usually rather quiet in school. If one of his female classmates<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tried to talk to him, he probably wouldn't know what to do.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, well, I can't imagine you really understand how girls think, Amane. But don't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    worry! Miss Chitose is here to advise you!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I guess I'm in your hands," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You guess? What's to guess? I may not look it, but I know women's hearts perfectly!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, you are a girl, after all… I guess."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Watch it with those guesses, buddy! I'm not sure I like what you're implying!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose cleared her throat and thrust out her chest. Compared to Mahiru, who Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    saw every day, the result was underwhelming at best. Amane awkwardly stared at the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ground.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Regardless of what he personally thought, Chitose was popular with guys. Personalitywise, she was cheerful and friendly, and she talked to everyone without playing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    favorites, so hers was a different kind of popularity than Mahiru's. She got along with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boys and girls alike. She really was the epitome of a life-of-the-party kind of person.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She had apparently been a member of the track-and-field club in middle school, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her slender build and toned legs certainly didn't hurt her popularity. It was a verifiable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fact that her legs were beautiful, so much so that Itsuki had warned other guys in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school that he'd get angry if they stared at her too much.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, right, right," Chitose chittered. "Something for a cute girl, let's see…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There were definitely times when she got too friendly, but Amane wouldn't deny that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose was cute. He could understand why other guys in school liked her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You know," Chitose added, "that glum attitude of yours is seriously gonna give<p></p>
    <p></p>
    people the wrong idea."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Gee, thanks for your concern," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fine, fine. So you're giving something to a girl, right? Well, what kind of girl?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose's question didn't leave him much room to maneuver, but Amane knew that if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was careless with what he told her, she wouldn't let him live it down, so he chose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his words gingerly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She's an acquaintance of mine, and she's relatively young. Beyond that, I'm exercising<p></p>
    <p></p>
    my right to remain silent."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh… if you won't tell me her about her personality or what she likes, even I can't come<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up with any ideas, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Can't you just tell me some things that you would like to get as a gift? Then I'll choose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from among them."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I get it; you don't want to tell me anything about her. Fine, we'll do it your way."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose made a good point, but if he told her any more, she would know that Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was close to a girl their age, and it was likely that the conversation would veer off in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    strange and uncomfortable direction from there. If he really slipped up, Chitose might<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even end up figuring out that he was talking about Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wanted to avoid that if at all possible, so he'd decided not to tell her anything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that wasn't strictly necessary. Chitose also seemed to understand that he wouldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    willingly reveal much more, and thankfully, she was kind enough to back off on the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    questions.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm, let's see… I don't know what type of relationship you have with her, but if she's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an acquaintance you speak with fairly often, I'm assuming she would be happy to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    receive something from a person who's about as close to her as I am to you. In that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    case, generally a consumable or everyday item that's not too expensive should be good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Itsuki told me pretty much the same thing," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Obviously. He understands how girls think. Now, if you're looking for a casual gift,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some sweets and a handkerchief or some small item might be good. If I got an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expensive accessory from you, Amane, I'd totally be like 'A bribe?!' or something."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't think I would get anything out of bribing you, though."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After shooting Amane a glance that seemed to be asking for some sort of recompense<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for her help, Chitose smiled and answered, "Well, you've got that right. Anyway, little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    things like that are safe."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Gotcha."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You sound kinda unsatisfied." Chitose cocked her head.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not that I'm not satisfied, but…" Amane trailed off. In truth, he just wasn't sure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Mahiru would appreciate the sort of gift that he would select. She probably had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    impeccable taste, and she seemed like the type to choose things that combined quality<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and functionality. Amane wasn't sure if his choice would measure up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose could sense a slight hesitation in Amane's demeanor, and she hummed a bit to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself. "…Let's see… Another option might be… something cute?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Such as?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Depends on the person's tastes. For example, a stuffed animal or a keychain with an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    adorable character on it. I think giving her something like that might work."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane blinked back at Chitose after hearing the unexpected suggestion, and Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smiled knowingly. "Most girls enjoy cute things, you see. There are even some people<p></p>
    <p></p>
    who keep collecting stuffed animals long after they grow up, and lots of girls like them<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in general, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…A stuffed animal, huh…?" Amane didn't know whether Mahiru had any girly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    interests, but she did wear clothes decorated with cute frills and ornaments, so she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably didn't hate cuter things like stuffed animals.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could certainly imagine Mahiru being happy to receive a plush toy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, do I sense some interest?" Chitose smirked. Apparently, she had caught the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    minute change that had come over Amane. He nodded, though he was still unsure, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    let out a small sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…But it'll be too weird for me to buy a stuffed animal, I think," Amane admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's a present; you're not buying it for yourself. What's the problem?" Chitose asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, a guy my age, carrying a stuffed animal to the register…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really are pathetic, you know that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm-hmm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no denying it, but it still hurt Amane to hear it. He ought to be able to get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    over such a petty hang-up, but even walking into a store that carried stuffed animals<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by himself was enough to make him feel embarrassed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Fortunately, Chitose was with him today. Amane thought he might be able to convince<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her to accompany him to a shop on the way home. It certainly wasn't out of the question,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Chitose, come with me," said Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whatcha mean?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Please accompany me to go shopping."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm, I wonder if I should…" It was just like Chitose to tease him like this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, she didn't really have any intention of refusing Amane's request, but there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could be no doubt that she was putting on a deliberate act, both to make fun of Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and to force him to beg for her help.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm asking you, please. I'm really counting on you," Amane pleaded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mmm, I guess I could go… By the way, Amane, I feel like eating something sweet. And<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the crepe stand in front of the station has a super-delicious-looking limited-time<p></p>
    <p></p>
    item…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Please allow me to treat you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yay!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane grimaced at Chitose's clever manipulation, but he realized it was a small price<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to pay for her help. It was way better to pay for one crepe than to go into a cutesy shop<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all on his own. Amane let out a powerful sigh as he looked at Chitose, who was grinning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    impishly, then mentally calculated his approximate budget based on what was in his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wallet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After consulting Itsuki and Chitose, Amane had at last made a decision on what to give<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru for her birthday. Staring at the back of the girl in question, a nervous<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression overtook Amane's face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As compensation for a deluxe crepe from the shop in front of the station, the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Wintertime Limited Edition Berry Berry Special to be exact, Amane had asked Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for one more thing. It and the actual present were now sitting in a bag together. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    problem was that Amane was completely at a loss for when he should give the gift to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The birthday girl was fixing dinner as usual, with no change in demeanor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't know what was on the menu, but it had the air of Japanese food and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certainly didn't seem like anything special. She seemed relaxed as she went about her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    preparations.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had made no indication at all that today was anything but another regular day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was acting so normal that Amane wondered if perhaps she even knew.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Mahiru started setting the table, Amane couldn't help but notice that her face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    remained completely unchanged. The two ate an extremely typical dinner and held a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    totally normal conversation. Through it all, Amane remained completely unsure of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    when best to present her with the gifts he'd gotten. Frowning, he glanced in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    direction of the paper bag hidden behind his sofa.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He decided to wait until they had cleaned up after dinner and returned to the living<p></p>
    <p></p>
    room, when he could take a seat beside Mahiru on his two-person sofa. She'd brought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some books to look over after their meal, so that seemed as good a time as any.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    True to her nickname, the angel was just as beautiful when she was reading.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without knowing why, Amane hesitated a little to sit next to her, but even if he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hesitated, there was no way around it, so he grabbed the paper gift bag from its hiding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    place and sat down next to Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Immediately, the girl's head snapped up. Whether she'd noticed Amane's presence or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heard the sound of the crinkling paper bag was unclear. Either way, her caramelcolored eyes turned toward Amane before shifting to what he was holding.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked confused, as if she still hadn't realized that this was about her birthday.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here. For you." Amane placed the bag on Mahiru's knees, and the girl's expression<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grew even more puzzled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What is this?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's your birthday, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's true… but wait, how did you know that? I don't remember telling anyone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was suddenly on guard.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Remember when you dropped your school ID in my apartment?" Amane reminded<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She seemed to understand, and her normal expression returned. "I really wish you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hadn't gone to the trouble. I… don't celebrate my birthday."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was certain that he'd heard a bit of cold detachment in Mahiru's voice when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she spoke. The look in her eyes told him that even the word birthday was something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she avoided.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I see, he thought. So the reason why she didn't act any differently, even though it's her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    birthday, wasn't because she forgot… She's been purposely ignoring it. Something about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it must bother her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane figured that if that wasn't the case, Mahiru wouldn't have spoken like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay then, call it an expression of gratitude for everything you do for me. I just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decided to give you something to repay you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Setting aside any mention of Mahiru's birthday, Amane pressed the bag on her,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    justifying it as his way of thanking her for her daily kindnesses. She cooked delicious<p></p>
    <p></p>
    meals for him every evening and helped him with his cleaning sometimes. When it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    came down to it, Mahiru did a lot to take care of Amane. He wanted to repay that debt<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in whatever small way possible.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane held out the present to Mahiru, but she shrank away. First, she looked confused,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    then she frowned at Amane's determination. Finally, she accepted the gift bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, can I open it?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru nodded and gingerly pulled out the box that was inside the paper bag, then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she carefully untied the ribbon and removed the wrapping paper.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something about watching Mahiru open the gift made Amane extremely nervous.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Inside the box was the hand cream Itsuki had suggested. It was nestled in a largish box<p></p>
    <p></p>
    alongside some sweets. Apparently, it'd been some kind of set. It wasn't the kind of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hand cream that smelled particularly nice, nor was it all that stylish. Instead, it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the scentless kind that was gentle on the skin. That way, it wouldn't cause any trouble<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while doing housework. This was the sort that was advertised as moisture-retaining.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had made sure to check the reviews of the product on the Internet, so he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certain of its efficacy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, sorry it's nothing too crazy. I just thought that since you do a lot of housework,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    your hands might get dry. They had scented ones, too, but I thought you might have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some of those already. Apparently, it's effective and easy on the skin."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It is… quite practical," Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I thought you would value practicality over anything else," answered Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, you're right. Thank you very much." Mahiru smiled slightly, as if she understood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's reasoning. A little less nervous now, Amane's expression softened a bit as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    well. It seemed like he'd made a good impression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was one more present, though, and Amane felt embarrassed to have Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    open this one in front of him for some reason. He'd hoped that she would only notice<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it after she had gone back home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, Mahiru was peering into the paper bag, looking as if she had already noticed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that there was one more thing hiding within it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What, a second one?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah. Yeah, there is. It's a bonus; I picked it out myself," Amane answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What does that mean?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Exactly what I said."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane averted his eyes. Mahiru tilted her head in confusion for an instant, then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    promptly pulled the second gift from the bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    To purposefully disguise this other present, Amane had intentionally wrapped it in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    paper the same color as the interior of the bag. He'd hoped that would make it stand<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out less—and that Mahiru would only notice it later when he wasn't around.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unfortunately, it was large enough that Amane should've known it would be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    impossible to miss. There was honestly no way Mahiru could have overlooked it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unlike the hand cream, this present didn't come in a box, just a polyester bag. It was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just about the right size to fit comfortably in Mahiru's arms. The bag was tied up with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a navy-blue ribbon, and Amane watched Mahiru undo that carefully as well,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wondering if it would be all right for him to stand up from his seat. Finally, Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    carefully pulled out what lay inside.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She held the bag's contents up gently with both hands, blinking her large eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dramatically, looking truly surprised.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…A bear?" Mahiru mumbled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was a stuffed animal. Not too large, it was perfectly proportioned for an elementary<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school student. Its light-colored fur was soft, much like Mahiru's own hair. A light-blue<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ribbon was tied around the toy's neck to form a collar. It had a rather cherubic look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stitched onto its face, and the round, cute button eyes had a luster to them that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reflected Mahiru's face as they stared at her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Doubtless, the girl was wondering why Amane had given her such a thing when she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was in high school. The truth was that Amane had taken a risk and chosen it based on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose's advice that girls liked cute things no matter how old they were.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, he had been much too embarrassed to go buy the bear alone, so Chitose had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    come with him to make the purchase, though only in exchange for the deluxe crepe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from the shop in front of the station.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose's smiling face had loomed over Amane throughout the whole process of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    buying the bear and getting it wrapped. In the end, he couldn't help but think it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    might've been better if he'd just gone alone. Though, there was nothing he could do<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about it now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I thought it looked like something a girl would like," Amane mumbled to no one in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    particular, scratching his head. He was terrible at stuff like this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The last time he'd gotten a present for a member of the opposite sex was when he'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    given gifts to his mother as a little kid. Amane had never once thought he'd have to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pick something out for a girl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So it doesn't faze her to get a cute stuffed animal from a boy, huh…?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Risking a quick glance at Mahiru, Amane saw her staring directly into the bear's face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He couldn't tell from her expression whether she was happy, only that her eyes were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fixed on the stuffed animal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean… If you don't like it, you can just toss it," Amane said, hoping to diffuse the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    situation with some light humor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru turned sharply toward him and drew her eyebrows tightly into a frown. "I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would never!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "S-sure, I, uh, didn't think you would or anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The response had been so absolute that Amane couldn't help but flinch and barely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    managed to nod in answer. Mahiru looked back at the bear in her hands again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I would never do such a cruel thing. I'll treasure it." Slender arms embraced the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stuffed bear, as if to wrap it up entirely. Amane couldn't decide if Mahiru looked more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like a child with a favorite toy or a mother protecting an infant. Either way, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certainly embraced the bear enthusiastically, looking down at the thing as though it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were the most precious object in the world.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's face was not the stony mask she kept up at school, nor was it the face she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    often wore when she was exasperated with Amane. This time it was peaceful, soft, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    somewhat affectionate—an unmistakably sweet expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt an innocence in her, and her pure smile was beautiful enough to take his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    breath away. She was really exceptionally cute.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I shouldn't be staring, Amane thought. Mahiru was liable to notice if he kept looking at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was certain that he wasn't in love, but seeing a beautiful girl make a face like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that, and knowing that he was the cause of it, undeniably made his heart throb. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked so adorable as she sat there with a faint smile, hugging the stuffed animal to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her chest. Anyone who saw her would've been captivated by the sight. Amane certainly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was, despite his usual reservations.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just pressing a palm to her face would've made it immediately apparent how much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    warmer it was than usual. Embarrassed after being so open with her emotions, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    swore under her breath. "…Damn." The word was so quiet it could barely be heard.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Fortunately, Mahiru did not seem to have noticed how Amane was looking at her,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because her face was half-buried in the stuffed animal that she was clutching to her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She still looked extremely sweet, and Amane was worried he would say something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    strange in spite of himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm really glad you like it." Thankfully, Amane managed to keep what he said brief.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Quickly, Mahiru turned to face him. "This is the first time I've ever received something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like this."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? With how popular you are, I thought you'd be getting presents like this all the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    time…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What do you take me for…?" It came as a relief to see Mahiru's usual behavior return,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but that was only because Amane couldn't see her current expression behind the bear.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I never told anyone when my birthday was," Mahiru continued, looking back down<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at the stuffed animal. "I hate that day, so I don't really share it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's expression softened as she looked at her gift, though her words remained<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sharp. The apparent dissonance set Amane on edge a bit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Normally, I hate getting presents from strangers, so I don't accept them," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're accepting this, though," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Fujimiya…," Mahiru said quietly, "you're not a stranger."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Face still half-buried in fur, Mahiru looked up toward Amane again. She wore a dreamy,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    innocent expression. It was captivating, and as Amane gazed at the angel sitting on his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couch, he realized he was in trouble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was so cute that Amane found himself reaching unbidden to stroke her hair,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and he had to quickly stuff his hand behind his back before he did something really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    awkward.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …That was close! If Amane had let his guard down, he probably would've started<p></p>
    <p></p>
    patting Mahiru on the head right then and there. Doing something so inappropriate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would have destroyed everything he'd built with her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What is it?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "N-nothing," Amane replied shyly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Perhaps Mahiru had seen his arm move, or maybe she'd noticed his obvious distress<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as he struggled to keep his alarming feelings from bubbling to the surface. Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    head tilted to one side in puzzlement. That simple movement was enough to leave<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane speechless, and it occurred to him that beautiful girls possessed a terrifying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    power. Still, he felt embarrassed for being so captivated by Mahiru's cuteness. He was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    also confident that if he told her how he felt, she would just be confused.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something about the feeling instilled a sense of danger in Amane, and he did his best<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to push it deep down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you very much, Fujimiya," Mahiru said in a soft voice, but Amane had already<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turned away from her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, hey, Amane, how'd it go with that girl you got the present for?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Obviously Chitose was going to pry, since Amane had convinced her to come along<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shopping with him. The day after Mahiru's birthday, Amane was confronted by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose's grinning inquiry.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose was in a different class but had come to his classroom after school. That alone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't much of an issue, but hers was the sort of smile that made Amane feel like she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was up to something. Today especially, he felt the urge to turn and run.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing happened—at least, not anything like you're imagining," Amane answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was the truth. He definitely wasn't holding on to any amorous feelings, and he hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    given Mahiru the present because he hoped it would lead to the start of something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more. Sure, she'd graciously accepted the gifts, but there had certainly been no<p></p>
    <p></p>
    romantic developments of the kind that Chitose anticipated.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now hold on," Itsuki interrupted, "The fact that you were so concerned about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone at all is a pretty rare thing, you know. You suddenly have some acquaintance<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that you seem involved with, and it's a girl. Very suspicious."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's nothing like that." Amane knew he had to shut this down now. He was happy that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had been pleased with her gifts, but he was starting to think that bringing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    other people into the situation was more trouble than it'd been worth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Not wanting to feed their curiosity anymore, Amane had answered as bluntly as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    possible, but Itsuki had his hand to his mouth, as if he was pondering something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Hmm… say, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What is it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is it possible that the person you gave the present to is… your neighbor?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki was smart and very perceptive, which at times like these could be a real pain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What makes you think that?" Amane asked nervously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, she's the only person I could think of that bothers taking care of you. And you're<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not from around here, so you don't know many people. Plus, you don't hang out with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    many girls. She brought you dinner that other day, right? I was thinking that maybe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this was about you wanting to return the favor."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm… Amane has been looking very healthy recently, right, Chi?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, I thought so, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She must be bringing him meals pretty frequently, huh? I wonder if that's why he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wanted to give her a birthday present, to thank her?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane fought to maintain a blank expression as Itsuki perfectly described the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    situation to Chitose. It was so accurate that it was like he had been there to watch it all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    go down. Sometimes Itsuki was scary like that. Amane could see why his friend was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so popular. He was a bit of a show-off but also smart and thoughtful. Amane just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wished Itsuki would save the grandstanding for his girlfriend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What an overactive imagination…," Amane interjected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you won't fess up, so imaginations are all we've got. C'mon, spill it!" Itsuki pressed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Who knows…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're holdin' out on us!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So stingy!" Chitose chimed in agreement.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No matter what anyone said, Amane wasn't planning on confirming the truth. If he let<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anything slip, Itsuki and Chitose would never stop hounding him until he'd spit out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the whole story. Really, Itsuki was only the tip of the iceberg; Amane was in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    presence of a high school girl who loved gossip, especially when it came to romantic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    affairs. While there wasn't the slightest bit of romance to be found here, if Chitose got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one whiff of the person involved, Amane would never hear the end of it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sighing in exasperation, Amane finished packing his things and shouldered his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    backpack. He'd decided on a strategic retreat, before his two friends gave him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heartburn.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "See ya. You two can go ahead and flirt all you like in private," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We were gonna do that whether you said to or not!" Itsuki shouted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Itsuki, weren't we gonna tail him and try to meet the girl in question…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, uh, you probably shouldn't discuss your operation in front of the target… And<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anyway, there's nothing to see. Even if there was, you two would never make it past<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the lobby!" Amane scolded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Tch!" Chitose's lips curled into a cute pout, but her eyes were serious. Apparently, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really had been planning on tailing Amane. Nervously hurrying out of the room,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane left his friends behind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…That was a close one," Amane grumbled without thinking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What was?" Mahiru asked him curiously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was still a little early to make dinner, but Amane and Mahiru had gone shopping and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    come back to his apartment. They'd been relaxing for a bit, when Mahiru overheard<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane talking to himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had been acting the same as usual; there was no trace of the girl who'd been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so enamored with the stuffed bear. The same placid expression remained, and Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wondered if perhaps he'd dreamed up the whole birthday incident. Actually, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    preferred her this way. He wasn't sure his heart could stand regularly seeing her look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at him the way she had the other day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, well, Itsuki and Chitose were suspicious about the present."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane intended to explain that he'd consulted them about the present, but Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed to remember Itsuki's name, and she exhaled, saying "Ah, I see" as if she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    understood.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it didn't seem like the sort of thing you would buy on your own."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not what I was concerned about…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, no one thought Amane was capable of getting a gift for a girl. If he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    being honest, he really didn't think he'd ever experience the many sweet and bitter<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feelings that were supposed to accompany love all at once.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My shopping is my business. Why does everyone think that way about me anyway?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Certainly, Mahiru was cute, and yesterday he'd felt a desire to reach out and touch her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That much he couldn't deny, but what young man wouldn't have felt that way? Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was outrageously beautiful, after all. Amane had been caught up in her beauty; that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was all. Nothing about what had happened was evidence he had any deeper feelings.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was a great person, but Amane was not interested in her like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He glanced over at Mahiru. She was just as beautiful as ever, but Amane's heart didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pound like it had the night before. Once again, he reminded himself that he didn't care<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for Mahiru in any meaningful way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Worried that Mahiru would say something if she caught Amane staring at her, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked down at his phone instead. When he did, he realized he'd received a ton of new<p></p>
    <p></p>
    texts. Thinking it was probably Itsuki, Amane decided to check them, but it turned out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they hadn't come from his friend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane frowned at the sender's name: SHIHOKO.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was one of only three female contacts in Amane's phone. There was Chitose,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, and… Amane's mother.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Wondering what she could possibly want, Amane tapped the message thread. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hated dealing with his mother's high-strung questions, always asking him how exams<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were going or whether he needed anything. He could barely handle Chitose, and yet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some members of his family were just like her. In fact, Chitose might become very<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much like Amane's mother as she got older. Shihoko wasn't so bad that Amane outright<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hated her, but he couldn't stand his mother's personality.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I brought some fruit back from Grandfather's, so I'm going to share it with you, Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'm sending it over, so be at your place on Saturday afternoon! I won't forgive you if you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    refuse delivery or aren't there to get it, okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So you can just decide my plans all on your own…?" Amane muttered. Now, he didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    actually have any plans for Saturday, but he thought his mother ought to have at least<p></p>
    <p></p>
    contacted him a little earlier.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did something happen?" Mahiru must have heard Amane's whisperings, because she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked over at him with her usual calm expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My mom picked some fruit at my grandpa's place, and she's sending it here on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Saturday afternoon. Probably apples and stuff," Amane explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do you peel your apples?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I guess I could do that, with a peeler."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That would peel them, but… it'll take off a lot of the flesh, too, so it's a little wasteful."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's words sounded like something Amane's mother would say, and he tried to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    swallow that thought before it surfaced.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If it comes down to it, we can just eat them whole," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How savage."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's a pain to peel them." Amane shrugged and grinned haplessly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're such a mess." Despite Mahiru sounding annoyed and giving a rather brutal<p></p>
    <p></p>
    assessment of Amane's table manners, the way she held herself also showed some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    understanding. "I guess it's all the same once you eat them."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You know, I'm not sure I'll be able to eat them all before they go bad. Do you want<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some, too?" asked Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure, I'd be happy to take some. Fruit is expensive, after all." It was kind of a domestic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thing to say, but then again, that was the kind of person Mahiru was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Saturday, right? In that case, I'll make us lunch beforehand as thanks," Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But you're always taking care of me already," Amane protested.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Like I've told you, I really don't mind making food for you, Fujimiya." Mahiru smiled<p></p>
    <p></p>
    very slightly. Somehow, the little grin made Amane feel awkward. It called to mind the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    events of the previous day, and Amane couldn't help but avert his eyes from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    beautiful angel in his apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…All right, thanks," he replied curtly.<p></p>

    10 Mother Invades<p></p>
    Asking Mahiru to pick up her portion of the fruit as soon as the package arrived turned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out to be a big mistake. When Amane heard the sound of the intercom and the highpitched, mischievous voice that called "Aaa-maaa-neee!" through it, he understood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he was in trouble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been very grateful for Mahiru's proposal to make lunch for him on Saturday.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It had seemed a veritable blessing from heaven at the time. Truly, the carbonara she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whipped up had been delicious. The thick-bodied sauce and the kick of black pepper<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were a perfect match, and it'd been tremendously tasty.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru hadn't done anything wrong. Those at fault were Amane himself for failing to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    recognize in advance what his mother had meant by telling him to be home on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Saturday for the delivery and that irksome, surprise-loving woman herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Um, Fujimiya? Is that the delivery…?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nope. That would be my mother. She's probably using her duplicate key to get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    through the front door and is heading up right now," Amane explained. Thinking back<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on it, it had been his own mistake to take what his mother had said at face value. One<p></p>
    <p></p>
    way or another, she always created situations that allowed her to come by and check<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in on him. Amane's mother could never resist employing a little misdirection.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Uh, your mother?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She probably came to see whether I'm getting along okay… and she didn't tell me she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was coming. Probably because she knew I would clean up in advance."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh-huh…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know it's all a bit hard to swallow, but that doesn't matter right now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Right now, the problem was what to do with Mahiru. If Amane's mother had still been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in the lobby downstairs, he could have sent Mahiru home, but that was out of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    question now that she was approaching his door. At the same time, his mother was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sure to get the wrong idea if he invited her into his apartment and she came across<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru. There was no doubting that Mahiru would hate that as much as Amane would.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The longer Amane puzzled over what to do, the closer his mother was getting to just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    barging right in.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I can't believe this is happening… Amane did have an idea, but he didn't like it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm sorry, Shiina, but could you please hide in my bedroom?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, wh-what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Take your stuff with you, and once I find some way to get my mom outside, you can<p></p>
    <p></p>
    go back home. I'm really sorry, but please?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With no other viable option, Amane took the helm and steered Mahiru into concealing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself. Thankfully, they'd already finished cleaning up after lunch, so that wouldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be a giveaway. If he hid her shoes in the shoe closet, they wouldn't be discovered, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru could just bring her personal effects into Amane's room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The plan was to let Amane's mom to make a quick inspection of the apartment while<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was hiding. Amane would mention to his mother that he really wanted to eat<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her home cooking, something that'd probably keep her too busy to push her way into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whatever it took, Amane had to keep his mother from breaching the bedroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He would purposely request that his mother cook something that used an ingredient<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he didn't have in his refrigerator. If the two of them went out shopping together, that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would provide Mahiru with a window to escape.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hurriedly explained to Mahiru that such a scheme was the only option as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    handed her his extra key and asked her to cooperate with the greatest sincerity he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could muster.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "O-okay," she said, nodding in bewilderment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In truth, the storage room was also an option, but Amane didn't want a girl to wait in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there. It had no heating, which meant it was quite cold this time of year. Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bedroom had a proper heater, as well as soft cushions. It wouldn't do to have Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sitting on a bare floor while she shivered from the cold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…All right, I'm counting on you. I have to deal with my mom, so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even before meeting his mother, Amane looked dejected. He headed for the entrance<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while Mahiru quietly slipped into the bedroom. After making sure that the angel was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hidden, Amane reluctantly opened the front door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My goodness Amane, that took you long enough. I'm glad to see you're looking well. I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was starting to wonder if you were asleep."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was Amane's mother, standing just outside his apartment. He hadn't seen her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    since summer break.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Although she was a parent, it would have been difficult to tell from her looks alone. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't just that her face looked young, she never acted her age, either. She wore the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    same sort of happy expression she often had back when Amane was still living at home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah, I'm perfectly fine, so how about heading home?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How can you say that to your own mother? It took me several hours to get here, you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    know? Don't I even get a thank-you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you very much for traveling a great distance, now please go home."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come now, don't say such things. It's not very endearing. You should act more like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shuuto, your father!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Men don't need to be endearing, do we?" While Amane had spat his words acidly, his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mother, Shihoko, didn't seem bothered at all, instead breaking into a fit of laughter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You've really hit your rebellious phase!" she said. "I hope you're not planning on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    having me stand outside all day. I'm coming in, okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wait, nobody said you could—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Have you forgotten that your father and I pay the rent on this place?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was nothing Amane could do to argue or refuse his mother once she'd played<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that card. Reluctantly, he allowed her to enter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    To keep her from going into the bedroom, Amane casually guided his mother to walk<p></p>
    <p></p>
    past the bedroom door and into the living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "By the way, you really should tell me beforehand when you plan on visiting," said<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now, I wouldn't be able to get a proper picture of my son's living situation if I didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    show up unannounced, would I?" Shihoko replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ugh… Look, there's no problem, okay? I'm keeping the place clean."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You certainly are; I'm surprised. You never kept your room clean at home, but you're<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doing better than I'd expected. I'm surprised." Shihoko nodded seriously, looking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    genuinely astonished as she surveyed the living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The unspoken truth was that his place was only clean because Mahiru had helped<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane tidy up. Her advice and constant scolding was a big part of how his place had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    managed to stay clean, too. Really, Mahiru deserved most of the credit, but there was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    no way Amane was going to tell his mother that now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your skin looks good, too; you must be eating well," Shihoko observed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yeah," Amane admitted, unable to meet his mother's eyes. Even his improved health<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was something he owed to the angel.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're even cooking properly, huh. Oh, but it looks like you're cooking for two?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko's manicured finger was pointing at his dish rack. Two people had eaten lunch,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so naturally there were two sets of dishes. Carelessly, Amane had forgotten to put<p></p>
    <p></p>
    them away. He should've remembered how perceptive his mother could be.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I had a friend over." Amane's answer was not quite a lie. He'd spoken as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    indifferently as he was able, doing his best to stop himself from shaking. It was fair to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    say that he and Mahiru had built up to something resembling a friendship, so it wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exactly untrue. There was the small matter of hiding that the friend in question was a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm," Shihoko replied with a tone that suggested she didn't really accept that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    explanation at face value. She scanned the living room again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose you get a passing mark. You're doing so well, I can hardly believe you're a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boy living on his own," Amane's mother finally conceded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Somehow, Amane had been able to deceive her, though only just barely. Strangely, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    felt a chill run down his spine, and he was sweating bullets. On the other hand, maybe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he shouldn't have been so surprised to have passed his mother's inspection. Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really had turned some things around for him, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "See, there was nothing for you to worry about, Mom."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose not; though I can hardly believe it. You could barely do anything for yourself<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at home. You've certainly grown up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm basically an adult," Amane replied, though inwardly, he scoffed at himself for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    having the audacity to say such a thing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good job," Shihoko praised, smiling.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It made Amane a little uncomfortable to hear that, since of course he hadn't done any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of it on his own. There was no way he could risk telling his mother the truth, however,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so he would have to leave things as they were and try to get her out of there.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She's pretty much finished her evaluation, right? I wonder if I can get her to leave<p></p>
    <p></p>
    without saying anything about wanting to eat her cooking or whatever, Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That just leaves the bedroom check, I suppose," Shihoko mused nonchalantly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's eyes went wide at the drop of that bomb. Mahiru was still in there. If his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mother found a girl hiding in the bedroom, a far greater disaster would ensue than if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had just revealed Mahiru from the get-go.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, don't joke around. Even if you're my mom, I don't want you digging around in my<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bedroom."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh? Something in there you're feeling embarrassed about?" Shihoko prodded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There's probably one or two embarrassing things in any high school guy's room, if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you think about it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So you admit it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I admit it. Please don't go in there."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though it was shameful, there'd been no other choice. Amane had been forced to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    go along with his mother's assumption to keep her from entering the bedroom. If she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    discovered Mahiru in Amane's room, she would most assuredly get the wrong idea.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For both his own sake and Mahiru's, Amane needed to avoid that at all costs.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane's mother saw him blocking the door to his room, desperately trying to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    keep her from getting through, she could tell right away that he was hiding something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Closing in on her son, Shihoko said, "I suppose you are grown up, if you're hiding those<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sorts of things from your parents."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If it came down to it, Amane was prepared to keep his mom out by force if necessary,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though he admittedly didn't like that idea. He stood ready to stop her, but then…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thump. There came a noise from inside the bedroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What are you hiding?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It has nothing to do with you, Mom."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So you say." A wide grin spread across Shihoko's face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was the kind of coercive smile that could not be denied. Amane became extremely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    uncomfortable every time she looked at him like this. It had a way of sapping his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    willpower to oppose her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane groaned, and Shihoko saw an opening. She put her hand on the doorknob to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his room, and by the time Amane noticed, it was far too late. Shihoko slipped past<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane, intent on discovering the source of the noise on the other side of the door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What met her eyes beyond that barrier that Amane had failed to protect was the figure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of a beautiful girl. She was leaning her back against the side of the bed while hugging<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a cushion to her chest. The girl's eyes were closed, and her breaths were a gentle<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rhythm. Mahiru had dozed off by the time Shihoko discovered her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A warm room with a heater running and a full stomach after lunch were the perfect<p></p>
    <p></p>
    conditions for an afternoon nap. Amane couldn't help but wonder whether Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    often slept in boys' rooms, but all this really confirmed was that she found Amane to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be harmless enough to doze off in his bedroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He couldn't exactly blame her for it. Sitting motionless so as not to make any noise had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably gotten real boring real fast.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The main problem was, obviously, Shihoko, who had arrived at just the wrong moment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to witness a situation she was sure to misunderstand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Had he been the third party, Amane would have gotten the wrong idea, too. He would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have assumed they were so intimate that Mahiru had no problem drifting off for a nap<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in his room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Grimacing all the while, Amane glanced over at his mother and saw that her eyes were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sparkling. He could only imagine the commotion she was about to raise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh my, Amane, you've got such an adorable girlfriend!" Shihoko shrieked in her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    youthful voice. "This isn't the kind of girl you can just hide away in a corner, you know!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt a headache coming on.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She had immediately jumped to possibly the worst conclusion available, and to make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    matters worse, she was clearly very excited about the idea that her son was dating<p></p>
    <p></p>
    such a lovely girl. There was no doubt that even Amane's mother was smitten with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's beauty.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked so vulnerable when she was asleep. The practiced air of elegant<p></p>
    <p></p>
    refinement that she always wore like a mask had melted away, revealing the full<p></p>
    <p></p>
    captivating nature of her looks. Her cute face had never looked more peaceful—or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more pretty.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had grown somewhat accustomed to Mahiru's appearance, but seeing her like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this, he was once again struck by her incredible charm. Her cherubic face held such an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    innocent serenity. Once again, he felt the urge to reach out and touch her. Her sleeping<p></p>
    <p></p>
    figure, hugging Amane's cushion tight, awakened many desires in him that were best<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kept private.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This truly captivating girl was Amane's girlfriend, or so his mother thought. It was no<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wonder she was excited.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose the reason you didn't want your mother looking in this room is because<p></p>
    <p></p>
    your girlfriend is here? Look at you, growing up right before my eyes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not it! You've got it all wrong! She's not my girlfriend or anything!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come now, you don't have to make excuses! Your mother has no intention of opposing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    your relationship, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I'm telling you, that's not the issue here! We're not in a romantic relationship!<p></p>
    <p></p>
    You've got it totally wrong!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, whether I'm right or wrong, she's in your bedroom right now, isn't she?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's because you showed up all of the sudden! We were just hanging out in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    living room, but I knew you would misunderstand!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You see, the problem with that excuse is that you would never let a girl you don't like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into your apartment. And I really don't think a girl would just waltz right on into the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment of someone she didn't like, would she?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane struggled to find a way to argue the issue. His mother was right; Amane was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    awfully territorial about his living spaces and wasn't inclined to let just anyone into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his domain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The first time Mahiru had come in, she'd practically forced her way, but ever since<p></p>
    <p></p>
    then, he'd welcomed her over, even when she wasn't coming to cook for him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I guess that means I really do like her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As far as Amane was concerned, he was sure he liked Mahiru for her personality, not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her appearance. He enjoyed that seemingly contradictory part to her. There was a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    biting and honest side of her that she didn't show at school, and yet she found it hard<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to be open about her feelings. He liked her curt and annoyingly helpful attitude and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the reserved way she conducted herself. When she was taken by surprise, she would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    get flustered, and the mask would drop momentarily, which was another thing he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enjoyed. Most of all, Amane especially liked that rare angelic smile that he'd only seen<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cross her face a few times. He supposed that each of those attributes were all precious<p></p>
    <p></p>
    parts of Mahiru's appeal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he had to say whether that was a feeling of romantic love, Amane would have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    insisted that it was something else, but he couldn't deny that Mahiru was a wonderful<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girl for many reasons.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I care about her as a friend. Not every relationship between members of the opposite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sex has to be romantic, you know. And I'm pretty sure she doesn't feel that way, either."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was not the kind of mama's boy who would obediently play along with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whatever Shihoko said. Plus, Mahiru would certainly object to the suggestion that she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had feelings for him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now, you don't know that, Amane! Aren't you being rather presumptuous, thinking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you know exactly what her heart wants?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What can I say to get you to understand that our relationship is not like that, Mom…?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shiina, please, help me out here…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No matter how he tried to explain, Amane's mother had already made up her mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane pressed a finger to his forehead, stumped on what to do. With all possible<p></p>
    <p></p>
    urgency, he wished Mahiru would just wake up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nn…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Either Amane's unspoken prayer had been heard or all the ruckus had, because<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyelids fluttered open, and she made a sweet noise as she raised her face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her flaxen hair slipped over her shoulders. The girl's shining eyes, the color of caramel,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were blurry with sleep, and she looked so vulnerable that it felt somehow wrong to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look directly at her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Maybe she wasn't quite fully awake yet as she looked up at Amane vacantly, her eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    still relaxed and drowsy. Amane pointedly stared in another direction.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shiina, I don't mind that you fell asleep, but there's been a misunderstanding, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    please help me clear things up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Misunderstanding…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, hey, Miss Girlfriend, what's your name?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was still clearly confused over what had happened, but Shihoko didn't hesitate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to approach her, beaming with an amiable, carefree smile and an overly familiar<p></p>
    <p></p>
    demeanor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was visibly flustered, still trying to get her bearings.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, uh, um…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's important to tell each other our names when we first meet, you know!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, I-I'm Mahiru Shiina…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, Mahiru, what a cute name that is! I am Shihoko; please don't be shy and call me<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by my first name, okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had reflexively given her name when pressed for it. She looked up at Amane,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her eyes begging him for rescue. Unfortunately, Amane was helpless. He had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hoping Mahiru would save him somehow. Regretfully, he shook his head. He knew that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    once his mother got started, there was really no stopping her. She was set on learning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more about Mahiru, and nothing would dissuade her now. It was unlikely she'd ever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    realize just how uncomfortable she was making the poor girl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A-all right, um… Mrs., that is, uh, Shihoko…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "See? That sounds more like my daughter-in-law."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fujimiya!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That could be referring to either of us, you know? Right, Amane?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mom, you're bothering Shiina."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, you mustn't be so formal with your sweet new girlfriend; call her by her first<p></p>
    <p></p>
    name!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko didn't seem inclined to listen to anything anyone said. Amane scowled at her,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but she didn't show any sign of letting up. Her smile was wide and utterly shameless.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, um, Shihoko?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, dear?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "He and I—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why, I don't know who you mean. He who?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…A-Amane and I; we aren't dating."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though she was obviously flustered by his mother's verbal assault, Mahiru tried<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her best to set the record straight. Unfortunately, she'd looked right at Amane and had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even been forced to call him by his first name, which was apparently exactly what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko had been after. The older woman's smile grew even wider.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I suppose it takes time for things like this to blossom. Something to look forward<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to," Shihoko said, quite presumptuously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Eh, ah, um, that's not…," Mahiru said, trying to object.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh no, I must have intruded just when things were getting good!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "U-um, I want you to let me explain properly! I don't have that kind of relationship<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with… Amane. We were just having lunch together because Amane can't cook!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What a wonderful bride you'll make, sweetie. My Amane set out to live on his own<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even though he's incapable of doing any kind of housework, you see. So I really do<p></p>
    <p></p>
    appreciate you supporting him."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, uh—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had put up a heroic effort, but she may as well have been banging her head<p></p>
    <p></p>
    against a wall at this point. The moment she'd mentioned visiting Amane's place,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooking there, and sitting at the same table as him, the sparkle in Shihoko's eyes had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    changed. The pushy mother somehow looked even more unhinged than usual to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once Shihoko got like this, he knew there was nothing he could do to stop her. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    only person who ever stood a chance was his father, Shuuto.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shiina, just give up. My mother won't listen to anyone when she gets like this."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can't be serious…" Mahiru sounded extremely dismayed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane realized that they weren't getting anywhere. Trying to explain the situation<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't working, and he clearly couldn't stop his mother's wild speculations.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "At any rate, my Amane did quite well to snag such a beauty. I'm surprised."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With Amane exhausted from arguing, and Mahiru having no clear idea what to do,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    both simply went quiet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was possible Amane's mother took their sudden silence as a sign of agreement,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though Shihoko had doubtlessly already assumed that their embarrassment was proof<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough of her suspicions. She was looking at Mahiru with no attempt to hide the wild<p></p>
    <p></p>
    curiosity in her eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What do you think, Mahiru? Can my Amane really make it, living on his own?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh… That's… Well…," Mahiru stammered. "…Enough to stay alive…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You should've just said I'll be fine!" Amane interjected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I remember the place being pretty bad," Mahiru reminded him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't bring that up. I'm keeping it clean now, aren't I?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And I've been helping you with the cleaning this whole time, haven't I?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's true, and I'm grateful for it," Amane admitted. "All of it, truly—the food, the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cleaning, and everything else." Mahiru was inarguably the reason that he'd been able<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to live so comfortably, and he would bow down in thanks to her without any hesitation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He knew that she wouldn't have done so much if she'd hated it, but he always strove<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to make his appreciate known.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As should've been expected by now, Amane's mother interpreted the exchange in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    different light.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well now, Amane, so it wasn't just today's lunch! Mahiru's been doing everything for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you this whole time, you useless child. The way you speak to each other—it's like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you're already living together!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No! How did you even reach that conclusion?! We only live next to each other!" Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fired back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Aha, so it was fate! Isn't that wonderful, Amane. You got me such a beautiful daughterin-law."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not denying that she's beautiful and talented, but I'm totally against calling it fate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or destiny or whatever!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Doesn't it sound more romantic that way?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not what I'm bothered by! I'm telling you we don't have a romantic relationship<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at all!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How persistent." Clearly, Shihoko was choosing to believe that Amane was still too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    embarrassed to admit the truth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's face contorted into a progressively deeper grimace, and he heaved his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heaviest sigh of the last few months. He couldn't recall how many times he'd suffered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at the hands of his mother's wild imagination. Shihoko was really the kind of woman<p></p>
    <p></p>
    who just did whatever she wanted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As for Mahiru, the one who'd been caught unawares by the full weight of Shihoko's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    overwhelming enthusiasm, she could do little else than look helplessly back and forth<p></p>
    <p></p>
    between Amane and his mother, utterly bewildered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, this is probably a parent's love talking, but my Amane isn't very good with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    words, and he isn't very up-front about his feelings, but he is faithful and gentlemanly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'd say he's a pretty good catch. Plus, he doesn't have any experience with girls, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you'll be able to get him to do whatever you want."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What on earth are you saying, Mom? Seriously, cut it out."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That last bit especially is none of her business, Amane thought angrily.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, it's true, isn't it? If not, then why haven't you had any other girlfriends? You<p></p>
    <p></p>
    resemble your father, so I don't think it's your looks. Maybe it's because you're a little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    immature?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's n-none of your business."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really should try harder to act cool in front of Mahiru, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I will not, and she's not interested, either," Amane protested.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, come now! Sweetie, you can train him to suit your own preferences, you know.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane cleans up pretty good if you dress him up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko, grinning madly, struck poor Mahiru again, who could do nothing but offer a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    vague sort of smile in return. Not even an angel could retaliate in a battle like this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's mother was truly something else.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mom, you're bothering her. Please go home."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What a big man you've become, telling your mother to go home."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm serious, please. It's really obvious that you're making her uncomfortable."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh? Is that true, Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't ask her; she'll definitely just say what you want to hear. Just this once, please<p></p>
    <p></p>
    head back. You can come back some other time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if you're going that far, I suppose I get the message. I did barge in while you were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    alone with your girlfriend, after all. It's only natural you'd be upset to lose your alone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fine, you can explain it however you like. Just hurry up and go!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was beyond tired of arguing with his mother, and this whole situation had to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be taking a toll on Mahiru as well. He looked over and saw that she also looked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exhausted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Vowing internally to shower her with appreciation later, Amane shooed his mother<p></p>
    <p></p>
    away and got a look of sour disapproval in return. Even so, Shihoko didn't make an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    effort to stay, so at least she kind of cared, though it was obvious her view of reality<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was still quite different.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, Mahiru, let's exchange contact information, shall we? I want a full report later on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    how Amane's doing, among other things."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, o-okay…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In a last-ditch effort, Shihoko tried to sink her hooks in again. Caught in the woman's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    powerful momentum, Mahiru wound up exchanging contact information with her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now Amane's mother would be able to reach her directly. The thought made Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want to press a hand to his forehead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Beaming wide, Shihoko gripped Mahiru's hand and reminded the girl to look after her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    son. Amane resolved to send his father a message later, asking him to rein Shihoko in.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm exhausted…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry; she's like a hurricane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko hadn't stayed all that long, but she'd left the two completely ragged.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After flumping down on the couch, Amane put his head in his hands and sighed deeply.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru gingerly took a seat, too, but her usually perfect posture was bent and haggard.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had thought that the angel could handle anyone, but even she had no energy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    left after the encounter with his mother. He was unsure if he should try to apologize.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I really didn't want to let her go home still believing the wrong thing," Amane admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, there's no real harm done…," Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I think there is… If she was acting like that, it probably means that she's taken a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    liking to you… One way or another, she's gonna be an issue…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was truly unfortunate that this was going to put a burden on Mahiru. Shihoko's love<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for all things adorable, coupled with her mistaking Mahiru for her son's girlfriend,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    almost certainly meant that Amane's mother would be finding new ways to poke her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nose where it didn't belong in the days to come. Trouble was on the horizon.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shihoko really cares about you a lot, doesn't she?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's a nice way to put it, but sometimes she really just refuses to listen…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    More than just an overly affectionate parent, Shihoko doted and fawned on Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even though he hated it. He knew he shouldn't complain too much, since it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably at least partly his own fault because he was such hopeless slob. It wasn't as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though he was ungrateful for all his mother had provided, but she could be a real pain<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in the butt, and he wished she'd give him more space.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…How nice," Mahiru mumbled quietly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane looked up at her. "What is?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your mother is quite a character but also very kind."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That means she's loud and loves to meddle."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Even so, I think it's nice."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's words weren't an empty compliment; she really did seem envious as she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mumbled and averted her eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A gloomy expression was plain on the girl's face. So much so that Amane thought she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    might break down into tears at the drop of a hat. Anyone could have sensed how fragile<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was right now. It was clearly more than simple exhaustion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru must have noticed Amane looking at her, because she suddenly looked up and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forced her lips into a small smile. Then, just as quickly, she regained her usual<p></p>
    <p></p>
    composure and leaned back against the sofa, something she rarely did.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What are you saying all of a sudden?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing… I was just thinking that it's been a while since anyone called me by my first<p></p>
    <p></p>
    name. Most people only address me by my family name."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was pretty surprising to know that someone who seemed as popular as Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't actually have any friends close enough to call her by her first name. Everyone at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school saw her as a flawless angel. Even Mahiru's acquaintances probably maintained<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some degree of formality with her, and nobody had the courage to really get to know<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her. A lot of students only ever addressed her by a nickname that Mahiru herself didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even like.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I guess if you don't have any close friends, that would leave only your parents,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    right?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My parents would never talk to me that way. Absolutely not." Mahiru's reply was cold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Looking her over, Amane saw that Mahiru's face was an expressionless mask. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    resembled a beautiful doll, completely devoid of feeling. That, too, only lasted a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    second, however, and Mahiru's visage changed again when she noticed that Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was looking at her. Her eyebrows lowered, as if she was troubled by something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Anyway, it doesn't happen often," she muttered, before letting out a sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been wondering for a while if Mahiru had a bad relationship with her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    parents. It had been easy enough to imagine that she had problems at home from her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    frosty demeanor whenever he touched on the subject. Plus, she never went out to eat<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with her parents and hated her own birthdays, but Amane never would've thought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's parents were so distant as to not even call the girl by her first name.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thinking back to how Mahiru had quietly said she enjoyed Shihoko's personality,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wondered how the angel must have felt in that moment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru." Rather suddenly, Amane blurted out the word. He'd never called his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    neighbor by her first name before. The girl in question blinked her caramel eyes. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked stunned, and Amane could tell that he'd caught her off guard. The momentary<p></p>
    <p></p>
    surprise had revealed a youthfulness about Mahiru that she normally kept hidden.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's your name. Someone ought to call you by it," Amane reasoned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I suppose you're right," Mahiru answered bluntly. A few moments later, a tiny smile<p></p>
    <p></p>
    appeared. Amane's chest felt fluttery when he spotted it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he heard her small voice pronounce his own first name, the flutter turned to a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    storm. Maybe it was because, until just a moment ago, his mom was the one calling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him by his first name, but when Mahiru called him by his first name face-to-face, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    felt the uneasy, impatient stirring in his chest churn and roar.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Please don't call me that outside, okay?" Mahiru reminded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I already wasn't planning to. That goes for you, too. Don't slip up outside the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Understood. It's our secret, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't bring himself to look directly at Mahiru, as she was still grinning a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    little. Looking away, he responded in agreement and shifted in his seat, turning away<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to escape the angel's smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though Shihoko's Saturday invasion had been a nightmare, nothing much had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    changed aside from how Amane and Mahiru referred to each other.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They hadn't suddenly become any closer. Addressing each other a little more directly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't a big deal. At most, perhaps Mahiru's demeanor had softened a little, but that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Um, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had come over earlier than usual for dinner on Sunday, perhaps feeling a little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    uneasy, because she looked troubled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was glad to let her in, but he was confused by her peculiar attitude. He'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought that maybe using their first names didn't sit right with her after all, but when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the time had come, she'd said his name without hesitation, so there must have been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something else bothering her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For the time being, they sat on the sofa together, and as he waited to see what Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would do, she pulled a handkerchief from her skirt pocket.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane continued to wonder what was up, Mahiru opened the neatly folded<p></p>
    <p></p>
    handkerchief to reveal a tarnished silver key. It must have been the one he'd given her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the day before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm returning your spare key. In the end, I never got the chance to use it, and then I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forgot to give it back. I'm very sorry about that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I see."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, Mahiru hadn't been able to rest until she'd returned the key. Satisfied that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he understood the cause for her strange behavior, Amane stared at the bit of metal<p></p>
    <p></p>
    resting on the handkerchief.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now that he thought about it, Mahiru came over to fix dinner in his apartment almost<p></p>
    <p></p>
    every night. Usually, he met her at the door, but sometimes it took him a while. There'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even been times where Mahiru had been forced to wait because he wasn't home. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    must have been inconvenient for her to have to wait outside for him, especially during<p></p>
    <p></p>
    these colder months. Somewhere, Amane had heard that chilly weather was a girl's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    worst enemy, and now that he thought about it, he wouldn't have been too happy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    waiting in the cold, either, had the situation been reversed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Mahiru was basically coming over every day, he wondered if it wouldn't be easier<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for her to have a key to get in.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's fine; I think you should keep it," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can give it back to me whenever we stop spending time together."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It seemed perfectly reasonable to Amane. Now that Mahiru had the key, she might as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    well keep it—but she didn't seem convinced.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "B-but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, going to the door every time you come over is a hassle."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, so that's what this is about."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I doubt you're going to misuse it or anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that's true, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been sharing meals with Mahiru for more than a month now, and he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    figured that he knew her pretty well. She was sensible, considerate, and kind. He was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certain that she would never hand the key over to anyone else or do anything while<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't around. If there was anyone he could trust, it was Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Besides, you must think it's a pain to have to ring the buzzer and wait out there all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the time," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Even if it is, I feel like you're being a bit careless."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But I'm giving it to you because I trust you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At that, Mahiru's eyes went wide, and she floundered for words. Confusion, along with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something else that Amane didn't really understand, passed over the girl's delicate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    features.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The truth of it was that Amane had only wanted her to have the key to save himself<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some trouble, but if she really hated the idea, he was prepared to back down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As for Mahiru, she looked intently back and forth between Amane and the key for a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    few moments, then finally let out a gentle sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Understood. I'll hold on to it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You know, I'm never sure if something is a big deal to you, or if you even care at all,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane," Mahiru jabbed with a slightly prickly tone. She sounded fed up, and Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couldn't do anything but smile wryly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Suits me well, don't you think?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You shouldn't say things like that about yourself," Mahiru admonished.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's smile grew wider. Mahiru seemed to be growing more comfortable with this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kind of silly back-and-forth. They were now on a first-name basis, of course. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would've been strange if they hadn't built up some kind of rapport. While Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eyes were still full of exasperation, as if to say that Amane was really a hopeless case,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her gaze wasn't cold. In fact, there was a noticeable bit of warmth to it. She understood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Amane was just joking around.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right then, I won't hesitate to use this. I might even do something to your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment without telling you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Like what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Like… a surprise cleaning!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I would be grateful for that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Or how about if your fridge was suddenly packed full of food?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It'd make breakfast easier, and we'd have more options for dinner, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's idea of a prank clearly needed some work. Amane would've been glad to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    suffer under any one of her suggestions. That she couldn't come up with a real threat<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even when she truly tried only reminded Amane of Mahiru's gentle nature. It was quite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    charming and brought a smile to his lips.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you sure you're not making fun of me?" Mahiru looked like she ready to pout,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    which would've been cute in its own right, but Amane didn't want to upset Mahiru any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Suppressing the grin that threatened to break out, Amane said, "Course not."<p></p>

    11 A Reward for the Angel<p></p>
    "Well, guess that's how it goes," Amane grumbled as he looked the list of names up and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down. The rankings for the previous week's tests were out, so Amane had shown up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to check them like the rest of his class.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Coming in at twenty-first, Amane was situated around his usual score. It was a good<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough ranking but hardly a result that stood out. He hadn't found this exam any more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    challenging than previous ones, though it was still a relief to see he'd done as well as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he'd expected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Surprising no one, Mahiru reigned over all the rest from her typical first-place<p></p>
    <p></p>
    position. She truly was a genius, but Amane knew perfectly well that she didn't attain<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that position without applying herself. Amane had often seen her studying after<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dinner. He wasn't about to argue that Mahiru wasn't smart, but he felt confident that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it was the hard work that put her at the top more than anything else.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shiina is first again, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course she is. The angel's on a whole different level."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Such proclamations caused Amane to make a sour face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What's with that look? Was your rank that bad?" Itsuki came over, puzzled by his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    friend's odd expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Only the top fifty test scores had been posted. As such, Itsuki hadn't come to see his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    own score, but rather, to accompany Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's nothing. I'm twenty-first."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh? Isn't that better than last time?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Only by a little. Gotta consider the margin of error."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whoa, you clever people even speak differently compared with us common folk."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki grinned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah." Amane ignored his friend's sarcasm and turned back to the class<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rankings. He knew Mahiru really gave it her all when it came to studying. She didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like all that effort to show, however, so she worked tirelessly in secret to make her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    success look like it came naturally. Others might've praised her or called her a genius,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but since they didn't know about all the behind-the-scenes struggling, they couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    recognize her actual accomplishments.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That must have been an oppressive way for Mahiru to live.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I should at least do something," Amane whispered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm? What'd you say?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing. Come on, let's go back to class."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "'Kay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? What's this, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had gone to the supermarket and returned with dinner ingredients. When<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she'd started to put them in the refrigerator, a conspicuously unfamiliar white box had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    caught her eye.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm? Ah, it's a cake."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was likely that Mahiru already had an inkling as to the box's contents based on its<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shape, but she'd gone ahead and asked anyway. Amane had gone to a patisserie that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose talked about a lot on social media to buy the cake.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Do you like cake?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not really. I bought it for you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What? Why?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I thought it would be nice as a little celebration, because you were top of our year on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the test. It's to congratulate you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru quickly blinked a few times, unable to process that the cake was for her. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked quite taken aback.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "B-but I get top rank every time, so it's not really something to celebrate," she protested.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you're always working hard, so I thought it might be nice to get a reward for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    once. It's a shortcake. I hope you like that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? I mean… I don't hate it or anything…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Great. Have some after dinner."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While Mahiru still looked a bit troubled, Amane cut the conversation off there. He'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decided that it would be best to act like this was no big deal, since Mahiru always<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed troubled when people treated her like she was special.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was the type of person who would exhaust herself taking care of someone else<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but then neglect herself. Amane had never once seen the girl do anything enjoyable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for her own sake, and whenever anyone praised her or showed appreciation, she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just redouble her efforts and run herself down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Simply put, Mahiru was not good at accepting kindness from others. Amane hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    known her for all that long, but he was sure that much was true. That's why he wanted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to return just a little bit of the kindness she was always showing him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane smiled again as Mahiru got everything ready in the kitchen and began cooking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for that night.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After dinner, Mahiru put the cake on a plate and brought it over to the coffee table with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a nervous expression. Amane couldn't help but chuckle at the sight.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wh-why are you laughing?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing. Don't worry about it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It doesn't seem like nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine—stop worrying."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane found it amusing that Mahiru was acting so stiff, but his laughter clearly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bothered her. He was supposed to be showing her some appreciation, not making fun<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of her, so Amane quickly shut up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru set the cake and the coffee she had brought along with it on the low table, then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sat down on the sofa.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her movements were still slightly stilted, and Amane felt another fit of laughter<p></p>
    <p></p>
    coming on, but Mahiru was sitting next to him now, so he did his best to quash the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    temptation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A shy look in her eyes, Mahiru glanced up at Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Right, so congratulations," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you very much. But…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine; just enjoy it. You worked hard."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's true, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, eat up. Even you should treat yourself to something nice once in a while."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The deed was done, and the cake was already here. Mahiru couldn't object to that. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gave a small nod before picking up the plate of cake and a fork.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Very well, then I will gratefully accept this," she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Please go ahead."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With a nimble wave, Mahiru cut the cake into bite-size pieces with her fork and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cautiously tried some. Amane imagined that girls were naturally very picky about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    their sweets, but since he'd gotten the cake from one of Chitose's favorite shops, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was fairly confident it was a good choice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He knew his hunch was correct when he saw Mahiru's eyes widen slightly when she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    put the cake in her mouth, then the corners of her mouth relax slightly. Usually,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's expressions really didn't change all that much, but recently, she'd become a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bit more animated, or perhaps it was that Amane had gotten better at reading her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    emotions.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The mellow, carefree face that Mahiru let show as she slowly savored her cake was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one she made only while eating.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Hmm? Is something wrong?" She must have noticed Amane staring, and he quickly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, nothing," he answered hastily.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now it was Mahiru's turn to stare at Amane. Suddenly, she snatched up the fork again,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as if an idea had just struck her. She stabbed one bite of cake and held it out toward<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane in a suggestive way. In other words, she was offering to feed him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, um… no, thanks, I didn't really want any," Amane protested.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Really?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…No, well, um… if it's all right, I guess I'll have some, but, uh…" Amane certainly hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expected this development. At a loss, he reflexively agreed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A beautiful girl, hand-feeding him cake. For many adolescent boys, it would be a dream<p></p>
    <p></p>
    come true. Unfortunately, Amane's shyness prevented him from enjoying the situation<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as much as he would've liked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're the one who bought it in the first place, Amane, so you've got to have some,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed entirely unaware of any of the implications behind her gesture. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    maintained an ordinary, clueless expression as she held the cake out toward his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way he could turn her down, so Amane steeled himself and bit down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    An incredibly sugary flavor instantly hit him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…This is crazy sweet," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it is cake."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That wasn't what Amane had really been getting at, but Mahiru remained oblivious.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sweetness spread through Amane's mouth as he chewed, but he was too preoccupied<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with something else to appreciate the flavor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…This really doesn't seem weird to you, does it?" Amane questioned in a low voice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was practically gagging on sweetness and shame, and Mahiru was acting like this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was all quite normal. Amane snatched the fork from Mahiru's hand and held out a bite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of cake to her in the same way she'd done for him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Turnabout is fair play, right?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Um." Mahiru hesitated.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Eat it," Amane insisted, his tone surprisingly forceful. Mahiru looked even more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    confused. Perhaps knowing that she'd started this, she decided to play along and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    timidly took a quick bite. The action reminded Amane of a small bird nipping at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane stared at Mahiru as she chewed, and gradually, a change came over her. At first,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she'd just looked entirely bewildered, but as her mouth moved, a slight redness spread<p></p>
    <p></p>
    across Mahiru's face. By the time she swallowed the cake, there was no hiding her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    obvious embarrassment. Mahiru's usually milk-white cheeks now resembled apples,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and her eyes were shimmering, slightly blurred with tears.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So what do you think?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I-it's d-delicious…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not that. What do you think about being fed?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Surely Mahiru understood now how Amane had felt earlier, and her eyes shifted down<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to look at the floor while she trembled faintly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I feel very much like running away."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I bet you do. That's exactly the sort of thing that might give people the wrong idea,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you know. Save it for your female friends, okay?" Amane turned away sharply to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    emphasize his point.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay," Mahiru replied with a voice that was barely above a whisper.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She'd probably only fed Amane so easily because she trusted him. Mahiru hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    meant any harm by it, of course, but it was still troublesome.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A stubborn sweetness still clung to the inside of Amane's mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Guess someone feeling too safe around you can be its own kind of problem.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In the end, Mahiru curled up into a ball next to Amane, looking slightly embarrassed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as she let a small sigh escape.<p></p>

    12 Cooking Classes with the Angel<p></p>
    Amane usually bought something to eat for lunch at school, but on days off, that wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    possible. He and Mahiru each had their own errands to take care of, so it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    impossible to eat both lunch and dinner together. Even if it had been doable, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would've felt supremely guilty asking Mahiru to make and eat two meals with him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Usually, Amane only needed to handle his weekend lunches himself, but if he made too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    frequent use of the convenience store, Mahiru would scold him, saying something like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You need to eat a properly balanced diet." With the costs of his dinners piling up,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane also felt awkward about going out to eat for lunch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What to do for his midday meal was quickly becoming an issue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I wonder if I should cook something?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without any errands that would take Amane out of the house, he sat at home by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself. Noon was only an hour away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had likely already gotten started making something for herself, but the same<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could not be said for her hapless neighbor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When it came down to it, Amane could make something if he really had to. It wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like in manga where he'd churn out some censored blob. While it wouldn't look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    particularly fantastic and might not taste spectacular, the food Amane was capable of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    creating was edible. It wasn't exactly cooking, but it was close enough, and it kept him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The problem was that he'd grown accustomed to Mahiru's top-rate meals, so the idea<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of going back to his own dishes was not particularly appealing. Nobody would want to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    go back to such plain fare after sampling such delicious works of art.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …Augh, Mahiru really spoils me.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had become a slave to Mahiru's cooking. He felt ashamed at the thought of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    going out to eat again, but he'd also lost interest in convenience-store meals.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Deciding that he'd been depending on Mahiru too much, Amane concluded this was a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    good time to challenge himself. Even though he'd failed when it came to preparing his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    own meals thus far.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru wouldn't be with him forever, after all. Things between them were nice and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reliable for now, but there were still two years of high school left, so if anything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    happened during that time, this relationship of theirs might come to an abrupt end.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What's more, they would surely go their separate ways when it came time for college.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way things would simply go on like this indefinitely.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I guess I'd better try to put in a little effort now, while I still have her around.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Resolving to do something, even if it was relatively minor, Amane stood up from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sofa and grabbed his wallet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, did you go to the supermarket?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    On his way back from the store, Amane ran into Mahiru in the apartment lobby. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't sure if the coincidental meeting was good or bad. Mahiru looked like she'd also<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just gone out, because she was carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery<p></p>
    <p></p>
    store.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah," Amane admitted. There was no need to hide it, so Amane waved his supermarket<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bags to show her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With a curious expression, Mahiru asked, "Oh, was the shopping from yesterday not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough? Didn't you buy everything on the list?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "N-no, that's not it… It's just… I thought I might try making lunch on my own," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…On your own?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Despite the explanation, Mahiru's eyes seemed full of doubt. It was only natural.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Before becoming dependent on Mahiru's cooking, Amane had survived by buying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    premade meals and convenience-store lunches. It must have been difficult for her to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    believe that he was really going to cook for himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't want to say anything mean," Mahiru continued, "so I'll just tell you it would be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    safer for you to stop now. What if you burn yourself or get a cut?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You know, it's not like I literally can't cook anything at all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Right, it's just that you can't cook anything that tastes good. And that's assuming you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    don't kill yourself in the process."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's thorough dressing down left Amane speechless. She'd said exactly what he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself had been thinking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you say you're going ahead with it, I won't stop you," Mahiru said, "but manage your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expectations, or you'll end up severely disappointed."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Fair enough," Amane conceded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    By "expectations" she must have been referring to her own cooking. Mahiru was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    confident in her abilities, and she was well aware how much Amane enjoyed her food.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's just that, well, you're always talking about nutrition and stuff. There might be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some time in the future when I really have to live on my own, like college. I can't rely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on you forever, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Overdependence on Mahiru only spelled trouble for Amane. After realizing how much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had been spoiling him lately, he felt like he ought to be able to at least manage<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the basics.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes went wide at Amane's words, then she let out a sigh that sounded just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the slightest bit impressed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I think it's a great thing to set your eyes on the future, but if you're going to do that,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shouldn't you have come to me first?" she posed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Rather than making whatever kind of mess you're about to do without my supervision,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it would be much better for me to watch and ensure nothing goes wrong. Amane, are<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you confident that you won't accidentally destroy your kitchen?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…No." Amane sighed. He knew he made a terrible mess of his kitchen whenever he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tried to use it. With no rebuttal, he gave Mahiru a slow nod.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It figures," Mahiru replied stolidly. "That's why it's better for me to be there, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Would that be asking too much?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If I didn't want to do it, I wouldn't have suggested the idea." Her voice had a bit of a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cold edge to it, but since she was agreeing to help him, Amane didn't mind. He bowed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    deeply to express his gratitude.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't need to be so formal," Mahiru said, sounding flustered. Amane smiled, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the two stepped into the elevator, taking it up to their floor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…By the way, do you have an apron?" Mahiru inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No problems on that front. I bought one for cooking class."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And did you use it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There was really no point. All I did was measure ingredients and wash dishes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Figures." Mahiru sighed, as if that was exactly what she had suspected. She accompanied<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane into his apartment. There was actually another apron already there, one that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had left behind. Amane would've felt fairly uncomfortable using that one,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    however.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Donning the apron she kept at Amane's place, Mahiru gathered her hair up into a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ponytail, like she usually did. Eyes narrowed, she watched Amane put on the darkcolored apron that he had pulled from the back of a dresser drawer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wow, I've never seen you in that before, Amane. It kind of feels like the apron's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wearing you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, well, excuuuse me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I guess there's nothing we can do about that. So you've already decided what you plan<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to make, right? Since you went and bought the ingredients." Mahiru took a peek at the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shopping bag that Amane had set on a shelf.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane nodded. "Stir-fried vegetables and an omelet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Veggie stir-fry because I've been scolding you to eat more vegetables and an omelet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because you like eggs, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Bull's-eye."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not like it was a difficult guess. What seasonings do you have for the stir-fry?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "This: yakiniku sauce."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh… straight from the bottle, huh? I suppose it has that robust flavor that boys like…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and I guess it is tasty…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's better than me trying to make something from scratch, isn't it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If Amane had no yakiniku sauce on hand, he'd planned on whipping up something that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    used salt, pepper, and soy sauce instead. Truthfully, he was glad that he did have the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    yakiniku sauce. Amane whispered a silent expression of gratitude for his good fortune<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of still having a condiment he could use, then he followed Mahiru's example and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    washed his hands.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While he did that, Mahiru was arranging all the necessary utensils and lining up the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ingredients so they would be easy to use. Truly, the angel's efficiency knew no bounds.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For the veggie stir-fry, you just need to cut the vegetables up and fry them until<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they're cooked evenly through, okay?… Do you know how to cut them?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you making fun of me?" Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was obvious he knew that much. He wasn't very good at it, but he could handle a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    knife.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Under Mahiru's careful supervision, Amane began to finely slice up some cabbage, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he quickly realized how meaningless his earlier words had been after he cut his own<p></p>
    <p></p>
    finger.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    First Amane had been shown how to do it, and then Mahiru left him to try on his own<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while she watched. He'd done fine in the beginning, while Mahiru was helping him get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    used to the task, but as soon as she'd left Amane on his own, he'd slipped up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Owww," he mumbled, looking down at his finger. It was only a small cut, but it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bleeding.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The first thing to do was wash it, but of course getting it wet would sting, too.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I thought something like this might happen. Here, give me that." Mahiru took a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bandage from her apron pocket and skillfully wound it around Amane's hurt finger.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was equal parts grateful and impressed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're very prepared," he complimented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Beginners often hurt themselves."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You have no faith in me, do you?" Despite such an accusation, Amane knew full well<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that there was no reason for her to think he was even slightly capable. He'd hurt<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself almost immediately, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I do recognize that you were trying your best," Mahiru consoled. "That's wonderful."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Gee, thanks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I still would have liked you to ask me ahead of time, though."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You say that, but it would've been awful to make you cook lunch for me, too, especially<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on a weekend."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know you're trying to handle things by yourself, but if you mess up and it becomes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a whole situation that ends with calling me anyway… It would be easier to have just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been here from the start."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fine."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This time, Amane had gotten away with only a light injury, but if some terrible kitchen<p></p>
    <p></p>
    disaster had happened instead, or if he had used some appliance wrong and it stopped<p></p>
    <p></p>
    working, he knew he wouldn't have been able to deal with it on his own. Mahiru was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    absolutely right.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…And please don't ever try to fry anything. You'll start a fire," she added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm nowhere near advanced enough to make fried food," Amane admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't think it's actually quite that difficult… Once again, I'm forced to wonder how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you survived on your own all this time," Mahiru quipped.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry about all this," Amane replied in a sulky voice. "Now you know why I was living<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on convenience-store food."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked at him with concern on her face. Amane wasn't particularly disheartened<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or angry, so she had nothing to worry about, but Mahiru cast her eyes downward,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemingly a little troubled about something anyway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's just—I'm scared of the idea of you making fried foods, Amane, so if you really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want some, please come ask me instead."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right then, tomorrow I want to eat fried mince cutlets." Immediately recovering<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his good humor, Amane was already putting in a request for the next day's dinner.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru gave a small, relieved sigh once she heard that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, but you're eating plenty of cabbage salad on the side. And I'm making miso<p></p>
    <p></p>
    soup with lots of vegetables, got it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah. And… thank you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For everything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru did so much for Amane every day and still found time to worry about him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was truly grateful, even if he sometimes said stupid, hurtful things. He wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sure where he'd be without her. Admitting as much felt a little embarrassing, though.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You help me a lot," he murmured very quietly. He then promptly turned back to the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    vegetables.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Let's eat."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sounds good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Grappling with the vegetables had taken nearly an hour, but it had been worth it. On<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the table was a stir-fry made from clumsily cut greens, a beautifully shaped omelet…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and a pile of scrambled eggs.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Naturally, the beautiful omelet was one Mahiru had made in an attempt to provide<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane with something to use as a reference. While Amane had tried his best to make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a second omelet, he'd ended up with scrambled eggs instead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The failed attempt was set in front of Mahiru so she could evaluate his work. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    picture-perfect example, the platonic ideal of omelets, had been prepared for Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After pressing her hands together in thanks for the food, Mahiru grabbed a piece of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the tattered eggs with her chopsticks to check the taste.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's flavorless scrambled eggs, all right. Didn't you add any salt or pepper?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I forgot. Plus, I was supposed to be making an omelet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You scrambled it up too much. What were you thinking, mixing it with the chopsticks<p></p>
    <p></p>
    until it fell apart? I warned you about that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had forgotten to add the seasonings because he'd mixed up his egg while<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was making her omelet. Otherwise, he'd been under careful supervision<p></p>
    <p></p>
    throughout the whole process. The lacking flavor and shape of his eggs was clearly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's own fault.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    On the other hand, Mahiru's dish was soft, fluffy, and unspeakably delicious. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    difference between them was night and day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I think, for you, it was a really good attempt. The most important thing is that you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tried. Still, I'm worried that if I let you try it on your own, the cleanup afterward will<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be awful, so I'd like you to take it slow, okay?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm going to become totally reliant on you," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's a little late for that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ugh…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Just joking. Well, not really, but I like that you appreciate my cooking, and I don't hate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    teaching you to cook, either, so… really, you don't have to worry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thanks again—for everything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was really thanks to Mahiru's kindness that Amane was able to live as well as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was. He owed her quite a bit, but he knew that Mahiru would hate it if he groveled too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much, so he held his head high.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Curiously, Mahiru was wearing a slightly lonesome expression as she said, "If you do<p></p>
    <p></p>
    learn how to cook, Amane, I guess I'll be relieved of my duties."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was certainly true that when Amane learned to fix his own meals, there would be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    no need for Mahiru to do it for him anymore, but Amane shook his head.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, that's… I mean… Your cooking is the best, Mahiru, so please… I want to keep<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eating it for as long as I can. Though, I guess that's kinda shameless of me to ask."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane would never have denied it was selfish of him to want Mahiru to continue<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooking for him, but at the same time, her food was obviously leagues better than his,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and he couldn't turn it away. The addiction had long since set in, and Amane was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    terrified of being cut off.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes widened at the humble plea, and she smiled slightly. The vague tinge of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    loneliness vanished in an instant.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ha-ha. You really are hopeless, aren't you? Well, I don't intend to stop, so you can<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relax."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thanks," Amane said, feeling relieved that the shade of anxiety he'd seen on her face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was gone, replaced with a faint smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How about I get you to help me out sometimes? Peeling vegetables, measuring<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ingredients, things like that," Mahiru proposed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Like a kid helping in the kitchen."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, that's where you need to start, you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Amane's skill level truly was on par with a child's, there was really nothing he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could say back. Mahiru looked amused.<p></p>

    13 Christmas with Everyone<p></p>
    "Hey, Amane, can we have a Christmas party at your place?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nope."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The proposal had been immediately shot down, and Chitose puffed out her cheeks to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    make her disappointment obvious.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Christmas Eve was fast approaching, but since Amane lived separately from his family<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and was a loner by nature, the holiday didn't hold any real significance. Still, Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and Itsuki seemed keen on spending it with him and had come to ask him about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    holding a little celebration.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose had gone out of her way to barge into Amane and Itsuki's classroom at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lunchtime with the idea, and now she had her cheeks puffed out because of Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    near-instant refusal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, Amane," Itsuki angled. "You're alone anyway… ah, unless maybe there's a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girlfriend in the picture?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, there isn't."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well then, it's fine!" Chitose interjected. "Or could it be that you secretly hate us?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if Amane hates us, then I guess we don't need him, either," Itsuki added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In their own way, his friends were probably expressing their concern for him. There<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was also the possibility that they were hunting for a place where they could relax and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    flirt. Amane felt bad about refusing them, even when they made such exaggeratedly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    disappointed faces at him. He didn't actually hate them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was not to say Amane had no concerns, however. First was the thought of how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the two of them would act in a private setting. Amane could feel the embarrassment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    washing over him at the mere thought of Itsuki and Chitose's shameless intimacy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Then there was the fact that he would have to explain things to Mahiru. She would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have to steer clear until Amane's friends left, and he would have to be very careful<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about covering up any evidence of her frequent visits.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fine. I get it, I get it. The twenty-fourth, right? I have a condition, though: You have to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    set me free before nightfall and go somewhere else together to get all your flirting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    done. I'll remind you that excessive physical contact is prohibited in my apartment."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With Amane's concession to the couple's demands, Chitose's face lit up with a smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Guess there's nothing we can do about that rule. I'm sure we can work something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out," she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Who do you think you are to say such entitled things?" Amane quickly grabbed one<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of Chitose's cheeks and pinched.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Owwsh!" she slurred. "Itsukiii, Amane's buwwyying me!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, Amane, don't be mean to Chi! I'm the only one who's allowed to pinch her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cheeks," Itsuki said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fine, fine; pinch her real good for me, then," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Leave it to me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't you dare!" Chitose cried.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane entrusted Itsuki to carry out the sentence, but as one might've expected, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and Chitose turned it into just another excuse to flirt. Within moments, the two of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    them started messing around, playfully pinching each other's faces.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now Chitose actually looked happy to be pinched.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane shrugged. "…Can I go?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This was Amane's classroom, but he wanted to get some distance from the loveydovey couple before they got any more insufferable.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way! We've got to make proper plans. We need to arrange for food and a cake!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not making anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way Amane could fix a Christmas meal. Mahiru could handle it, no<p></p>
    <p></p>
    problem, but there was absolutely no way he could get her help this time. That's why<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane quickly brushed off the idea, insisting that it would be impossible for him to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cook. Chitose didn't seem convinced, however, and was staring at him strangely.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I was just thinking you look awfully healthy for someone who can't cook," Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So? What's the problem?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you see, Chi, Amane's got his own reasons for that," Itsuki commented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, well, don't you want to know about them, too, Itsuki?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'll get him to spill later."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not telling you a thing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane glared at Itsuki as if to tell him not to make promises he couldn't keep, and he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    laughed out loud, in a forced way. Itsuki knew when to let things go, but he had a bad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    habit of dredging up old stuff at rather inopportune times.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You guys are a real handful…," Amane muttered. "Well, for dinner, can't we get takeout<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or something? We'll have to order the cake if we want one." Attempting to move away<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from his own affairs that the couple seemed so eager to pry into, he made a pragmatic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    proposal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way he could make a cake or prepare a meal on his own, so arranging<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for ready-made food seemed to be the way to go.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, all right then, let's have pizza! I'll book a cake from my usual place; they're still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    taking orders!" Chitose declared.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't want chicken?" asked her boyfriend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You like pizza better, too, don't you, Itsuki?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "True, true. That's my Chi; you know me best."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Eh-heh-heh…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While the two lovebirds had decided on what to get without discussing it at all with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane, he was fine with pizza. Something like that made it feel more like a party<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anyway. Given the way things were going, they would probably pick up some takeaway<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pizzas from the shop that Amane and Itsuki often visited.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The moment Amane heard the word pizza, he thought of Mahiru—and when she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nibbled her pizza like a small animal. Amane had found it strangely charming, probably<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because he usually saw her eating so elegantly. Come to think of it, he'd gotten Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to eat cake the other day, too. Amane's cheeks glowed warmly as he remembered that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I won't do anything like that again, Amane vowed to himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It'd been so embarrassing to feed each other; there was no way Amane could endure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a repeat of that. Mahiru and Amane weren't some affectionate couple like Itsuki and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose, so the opportunity should never come up again anyway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Hey, Amane, what's up?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, no, nothing. All right, we'll leave the cake order up to you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had drifted back into some embarrassing memories for a moment, and Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had started staring at him with a concerned expression, puzzled. Panicking, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chased the flustering thoughts from his head and did his best to be casual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right! Let's get our pizza order in, too!" he said, a bit more worked up than usual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With Chitose's excitable voice still ringing in his ears, Amane returned home and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decided to ask Mahiru about her Christmas plans.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Christmas plans? I don't really have any," Mahiru replied quickly from her place on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the sofa. Amane had posed the question after finishing the dishes and joining her in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the living room. He'd been confident Mahiru would be going to a girls' party, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apparently, she didn't have anything lined up. Maybe Amane's surprise showed,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because Mahiru made an annoyed face at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Basically, all the girls I know and most of my female classmates have boyfriends to go<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out with. And I always turn down all the boys who invite me out, so my schedule is<p></p>
    <p></p>
    totally open," she explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Breaking all the hearts, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whenever she was out in public, Mahiru kept her guard up, and any hopeful suitors<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were sure to end up drowning in their own tears when faced with the angel's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    impregnable defenses.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Still, Amane had to respect anyone who had the guts to ask Mahiru out. No one would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be able to do such a thing without a huge amount of self-confidence, and Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    admired those optimistic types.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I wonder why boys want to spend Christmas with me so badly anyway?" Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wondered aloud.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "They're probably hoping to get to know you better," Amane explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What for?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, because they want to date you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And why would they want to date me?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Probably to do all the sorts of… things that dating people do."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How obscene."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane offered a silent prayer for all the guys who'd just been ruthlessly discarded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I don't think every one of them is like that, so don't be too distrustful. I'm sure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you understand that you're the sort of girl who draws all their eyes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're right. It's unlikely that all of them are harboring lewd thoughts. After all, you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    aren't like that, are you, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Have I ever treated you that way?" Amane had certainly thought Mahiru looked cute,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or that he wanted to rub her head, but he'd never gone so far as to fantasize about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    being intimate with her. If such things ever did cross his mind, Amane was sure that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru would likely notice and pull away from him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was only because Mahiru saw Amane as a harmless puppy that he could sit there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    next to her. Baring so much as a single fang could be enough to send her running away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The needs of Amane's stomach ranked higher in his mind than other appetites, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had no intention of jeopardizing his relationship with Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose you're right. You never seemed to have any interest in me from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    beginning, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm-hmm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's why I trust you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, thanks for that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As a guy, Amane wasn't sure how he felt about Mahiru's reasons for trusting him, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for the time being, he decided he was okay with being the "safe guy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…So, Amane, did you have something in mind when you asked me about my Christmas<p></p>
    <p></p>
    plans?" Mahiru inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm? Oh, on the afternoon of the twenty-fourth, Itsuki and Chitose are coming over,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so I thought I would let you know that, uh, our usual dinner might have to start late."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Having returned to the original topic of conversation, Amane carefully explained the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    situation while Mahiru nodded along.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I understand. Please call me once your Christmas party is over, and I'll make dinner<p></p>
    <p></p>
    then. I'll try to take care of the prep work ahead of time," Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure; sorry about all that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine. Have fun."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You won't be lonely?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm used to spending Christmas alone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's casual attitude about spending the holiday alone struck Amane as rather<p></p>
    <p></p>
    depressing. Perhaps thoughts of Christmas had reminded Mahiru of her parents,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because a small, self-deprecating laugh slipped out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Ah, um, this is really presumptuous of me to say, but… even if I can't do Christmas<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Eve, how about we spend Christmas Day together?" Amane felt extremely awkward<p></p>
    <p></p>
    making this sort of suggestion. He didn't have any particular ulterior motive, but two<p></p>
    <p></p>
    people getting together on the holiday usually did carry a certain implication.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There's no special meaning to this, Amane told himself. It was just that he hated when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked so lonely; that was all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Surprised, Mahiru blinked quickly at the suggestion. "Together? Doing what?" she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? Ah, well, I didn't really have anything in mind. Sorry." Now that it was obvious<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he didn't have a plan, Amane figured he should drop the issue. There was also the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    consideration that going out together meant there was a risk of being spotted by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone from school. That would be a huge problem for Amane and Mahiru both.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The best option would be spending time at home, but there was probably nothing in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's apartment that would interest Mahiru. It would likely boil down to just sitting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    next to each other, doing nothing, which would probably be incredibly awkward.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If that's all Amane could offer, he suspected it was probably better to just spend the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    day apart. As he prepared to withdraw his proposal, he noticed that Mahiru was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    staring at him quietly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Okay. I'd like to try that," It was unexpected, but Mahiru actually seemed interested.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her slim finger was pointing at the television. To be more precise, she was pointing at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the game console housed inside the TV stand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recently, Mahiru had been visiting in the evenings, so Amane hadn't booted up the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    system much, but it seemed like Mahiru was curious about it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I've never used one of those things…," she confessed in a small voice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't have any concrete reason to refuse Mahiru if she wanted to try playing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    games, but the thought of a guy and girl who weren't dating or anything spending<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Christmas day together playing video games was somewhat surreal. Even if he wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hoping for anything romantic, it was only natural that the idea gave rise to a confusing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mix of emotions.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, well, that'd be fine, but… is that okay? To spend the day gaming?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is there anything wrong with that?" Mahiru replied with her own question.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I guess not, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, then let's go with that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "S-sure."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Great, I guess that's what we're doing…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since it was what Mahiru wanted, Amane resolved himself to do everything he could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to make sure it happened. He wanted to at least give her this modest bit of enjoyment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was always taking care of him, and she hardly ever asked for anything, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would let her play anything she wanted, as long as he had it in his collection. It wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like he had any plans on Christmas Day anyway, so this was a small price indeed for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's fantastic cooking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, we can have a laid-back day that doesn't have anything to do with Christmas<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or whatever," Amane declared.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Then it's decided," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane found it difficult to look directly at Mahiru's smiling face, so instead he nodded<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and turned away while doing his best to look casual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Merry Christmas!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Christmas Eve arrived before too long.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    School had already let out for winter break, and everyone was probably spending the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    day enjoying themselves. Itsuki and Chitose had shown up at Amane's apartment,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    party supplies in hand, at around one in the afternoon.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    On the table, the pizza and juice they had ordered for delivery were already laid out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The three had actually planned to meet up a bit earlier, but the Christmas crowds had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slowed everything down and put them all behind schedule. Thankfully, it was only an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hour past noon, and Amane hadn't been waiting too long, so no one seemed all that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bothered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah, Merry Christmas," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, you don't sound very excited! Try again," Chitose instructed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Merry Christmas!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're saying the words just fine, but you're not really in the spirit, are you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't like to be compared to Chitose, who was very excitable by nature.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Realizing that she was even more worked up than usual, Itsuki did his best to placate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose. He flashed a flippant, yet still-warm smile at his girlfriend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, we don't need to worry about that. Let's get to the eating part and the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    having-a-good-time part and then the falling-asleep part," said Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can't sleep here, idiot," Amane snapped.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm just kidding, geez. Besides, if I am gonna sleep, I'm going to Chi's place."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You'll have to do that when her parents aren't around."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, Amaneee! What kind of perverted things are you thinking?!" Chi cried. She was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grinning, but Amane didn't respond. Instead, he made for the kitchen to grab some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cups and utensils. Pouting, Chitose looked briefly disappointed at this lack of reaction<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but then quickly followed after him, shouting that she would help.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The kitchen was, naturally, neat and tidy, with everything in order. Mahiru had made<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it her territory as of late, so all the various tools and seasonings were lined up for easy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    access.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whoa, this is way cleaner than I expected," Chitose commented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks a lot," Amane responded idly. He took small plates for individual portions and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some cups out of a kitchen cupboard. When he tried to hand half to Chitose, he found<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her staring fixedly at the cupboard.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What is it?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing!" she answered hurriedly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt something devious behind Chitose's sly smile, and a shiver shot down his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    back. The best course of action for the time being was to ignore her entirely, however,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so Amane did his best to act like nothing was wrong. He had a terrible feeling Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was brewing up some elaborate misconception, but since she hadn't said anything,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't sure what it could be.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Grimacing, Amane and Chitose returned to the living room where Itsuki was waiting.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was becoming abundantly clear that Chitose was in an even better mood than when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she'd first arrived.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Seriously, though, your apartment is super clean. It's so big and luxurious," Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    muttered. The three friends had mostly finished eating. They'd been listening to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Christmas music through the speakers in the living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was little Amane could say in response to Chitose's comment. He was living in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a nice apartment because his parents were paying for it, and the place was only this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clean because Mahiru had helped him keep it that way. After considering that, all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could say was "Yeah, thanks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's definitely impressive how much better the place looks now that it's clean…," Itsuki<p></p>
    <p></p>
    remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up…," Amane shot back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yep, yep, I smell a girl!" Chitose added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How did you make that jump?" Amane had no idea how Chitose made the connection<p></p>
    <p></p>
    between his clean apartment and a feminine presence.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm? Call it a woman's intuition. The way everything's arranged is a little off for you,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    personality-wise. There's something about the way the books are lined up and how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the cords are all gathered to keep them from getting tangled or torn. Plus, there are all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sorts of cooking implements in the kitchen that seem like they really don't belong to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…They're my mom's," Amane lied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Preemptively, Amane had shoved all of Mahiru's things into the back of a cabinet, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose must have caught sight of them when Amane had been getting the plates.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's tableware alone hadn't been enough, so Mahiru had brought a few things<p></p>
    <p></p>
    over from her place, but Amane hadn't expected Chitose to notice. For better or worse,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was not the kind of person who usually paid attention to such details.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it's not like we care that much, right, Itsuki?" Amane's reply had been suspiciously<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slow. Sensing a deeper meaning in that, Chitose leaned over to Itsuki, grinning.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Casually, and without a hint of hesitation, Itsuki reached over and rested his hand<p></p>
    <p></p>
    between Chitose's knees as he embraced her. It was getting extremely difficult to look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    directly at the couple.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, why don't you get a room, you two?!" Amane shouted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, you jealous, Amane?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Psh, yeah right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Rather than any sort of envy, Amane just wanted them out of his sight. He wished they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would stop, but this sort of behavior was business as usual for the couple. Scolding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    them for it was a waste of energy at this point.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Looking very satisfied with herself as she clung to Itsuki, Chitose leaned against his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chest and looked up at Itsuki's face. "…I bet everyone's flirting at their own parties<p></p>
    <p></p>
    right about now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, don't forget you've got a guy right here crying bitter tears of loneliness," said<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There's no way everyone is acting like these two.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There had to be some people who were spending the holiday with family—and others<p></p>
    <p></p>
    who were spending it with friends. Surely there were even some spending the holiday<p></p>
    <p></p>
    completely alone. Amane felt like Chitose ought to choose her words more carefully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Not everyone was lucky enough to spend Christmas with other people.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do boys really want sweethearts that badly?" Chitose asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't think they do," Amane answered flatly. "I certainly don't."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, but…," Itsuki interjected, "you're an outlier."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, everyone gets restless right before Christmas, you know," Chitose continued.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Especially single guys. The other day, I asked the angel about her Christmas plans and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    found out she'd ruthlessly rejected just about every boy in school. She left 'em all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brokenhearted because she supposedly already made plans with someone else."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh," Itsuki said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had a feeling that someone was him. The idea that he was little more than a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    diplomatic excuse to turn down other dates wasn't a pleasant one, but he knew that it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pained Mahiru to have to refuse anyone. If having plans with Amane helped ease<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's conscience, then he supposed he couldn't object. After all, she wasn't giving<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his name out, so there shouldn't be any trouble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All those poor boys looked so crushed. It was rude, but I laughed," Chitose recalled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You shouldn't laugh!" Itsuki scolded playfully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, using a holiday as an excuse to try to score a date with a girl you barely know<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is total crap, isn't it? They're already off to a late start 'cause they haven't built any kind<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of relationship, so they try to take a convenient little shortcut to get to where they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really want to be. Plus, I bet those guys are the kind who'd say they were taking her to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a party with a lot of people but then create some excuse to be alone with her. It's a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    scary thing, for a girl."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose went on to add that the angel was certainly not the type to go along with those<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kinds of games anyway, then stuck out her tongue and clung to Itsuki even more, as if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she'd touched on an unpleasant memory. Trendy and beautiful, Chitose had a different<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look than Mahiru. It wouldn't have been surprising to learn that she'd had some bad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    experiences with guys in the past. Amane felt a little sorry for her. Popular girls<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certainly had it rough.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It must be hard on Shiina, dealing with all those propositions," Amane said suddenly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're really not interested in the angel, are you, Amane?" Itsuki asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not really," Amane replied flatly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You already have that angelic next-door neighbor of yours, huh?" Chitose needled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't think I won't kick you out of my apartment…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, don't! I'm sooo scaaared!" Chitose whined, clinging to Itsuki as she playfully<p></p>
    <p></p>
    glared at Amane. "So you're not denying that your neighbor has been taking care of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's words stuck in his throat, and Chitose grinned with smug satisfaction, though<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her expression quickly changed when she saw his face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't glare at me like that! Sorry, geez…" Chitose apologized in a tone that held very<p></p>
    <p></p>
    little remorse. When Amane narrowed his eyes at her a second time, she gave a cutesy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shriek and clung to Itsuki again. Then she happened to look through the window<p></p>
    <p></p>
    behind her boyfriend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something outside was surprising enough for her to stare, so Amane also followed her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gaze and looked at the window, wondering what was going on. Little white flecks were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wafting down from the blue sky.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Ah, Itsuki, look! Snow!" Chitose cried.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whoa, a white Christmas!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Snow wasn't that unusual at the end of December, but it was rare to see any on such a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clear day, and it seemed to delight the lovebirds.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was still daytime, and the temperature was only going to drop as the sun began to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    set. Christmas Eve was likely to be blanketed in snow this year. Couples all over town<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were likely rejoicing, and the couple in Amane's apartment had already stepped out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    onto his balcony for a better view.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm sure you're going to be making out over there for a while, so I'll fix you some warm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    drinks," Amane shouted as he watched Itsuki and Chitose head outside. As Amane was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    standing up, a hysterical shriek suddenly caught his ear.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?! Wh-why are you here?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The last voice in the bunch was one Amane had only become accustomed to hearing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relatively recently. It rang clear and sweet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt his stomach sink.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Aware that Itsuki and Chitose were huddling together on his veranda, Amane dashed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out in a panic and saw that Mahiru had also come out onto her own balcony to look at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the snow. In doing so, she had been spotted by Amane's friends the moment she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    leaned over the railing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane looked at Mahiru, who was now sitting beside him, and sighed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Faced with the terrible disaster of everyone encountering each other on the balconies,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been left with no other option but to invite Mahiru into his apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No matter what Amane tried now, his two friends would definitely be suspicious. At<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this point, telling them the whole truth was probably the only way to avoid unnecessary<p></p>
    <p></p>
    speculations and misunderstandings. Things were bound to get worse if he couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    keep Itsuki and Chitose quiet about this, too.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Um, I really am sorry," Mahiru said gently.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You didn't do anything wrong."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was a white Christmas and also the first snow of the year. Of course Mahiru had gone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to her veranda to take a look. No one could've blamed her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If Amane had heard the sound of her opening her glass door, he might have been able<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to do something, but there'd been music playing in the apartment, so he hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    noticed. Mahiru had likely been trying to stay quiet anyway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose was staring at Amane and Mahiru as they reflected on their carelessness, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her eyes sparkled as she leaned in close. "So Amane's next-door neighbor was the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    angel all along?!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um, please don't call me that…" True to form, Mahiru hated being called an angel to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her face and politely objected to the nickname, but Chitose was grinning from ear to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ear, and it wasn't clear whether she was listening.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki, meanwhile, scratched his cheek and looked back and forth between Amane and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, eyebrows raised. "Wow. So… just to recap, Shiina lives next door, and she's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been making you meals this whole time. Is that about right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yeah," Amane admitted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "W-well… um, I had a favor to repay, and I could tell by looking at him that Fujimiya<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was not eating well, and that bothered me, so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The two tried their best to explain how they first met and why they'd continued seeing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    each other. Itsuki acted like he understood but still wore an expression like he didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quite comprehend it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought that if he were in Itsuki's position, he probably wouldn't be able to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grasp the whole story, either. Who would believe that an incredible girl like Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would so casually decide to start caring for an unremarkable slob like Amane?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm, so I think I understand the situation, but what's really strange about all this is<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the idea that you don't have any ulterior motives toward Amane, Shiina. Like, you're<p></p>
    <p></p>
    basically acting as if you're his part-time wife," said Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Guh!" Amane sputtered in surprise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Wife?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wouldn't have chosen such a word, but he had to admit that their current<p></p>
    <p></p>
    interactions did somewhat resemble that sort of relationship. Mahiru made him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dinner every night and had even treated him to lunch on a recent weekend. On top of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that, she sometimes helped him with cleaning. On the surface, it wasn't too far off from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stereotypical married life. The important distinction was that neither Amane nor<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru harbored any romantic feelings for the other.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes had also widened slightly at Itsuki's assessment, but she very quickly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    recovered from the shock, and Amane could see her slipping into her cordial public<p></p>
    <p></p>
    persona. "I can assure you that I have no such intentions whatsoever."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane realized that she was handling Itsuki and Chitose the same way she handled<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everyone else at school. Suddenly, he felt extremely embarrassed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's perfectly innocent," Amane added. "Shiina is just helping me out, okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you say so, Amane. It's just… What a strange pairing. It's really a bit hard to swallow<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that such an incredible girl is cooking for you… Hey, that stuffed animal you bought,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was that also for her?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Maybe," Amane conceded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whaaa—?!" Chitose broke into a shout.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, be quiet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I haven't said anything yet, though?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your face is loud enough."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Rude!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose's smirk was irritating. She looked incredibly pleased with herself for having<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "solved" this mystery. Up to this point, the conversation had proceeded without much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    teasing, and Amane was grateful for that. He certainly didn't need any unnecessary<p></p>
    <p></p>
    prodding right now, and Mahiru likely wouldn't be thrilled by the idea, either. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had been hoping that Chitose would keep her mouth shut.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on now; calm down, both of you." Itsuki put a stop to things before they really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    got out of hand. He'd picked up on the change in Amane's demeanor and was not the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    type to poke fun at his friend like Chitose would. Itsuki was the kind of guy who was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sensitive to how people felt. Of course, Amane wished he'd stopped before prying in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the first place, but that ship had sailed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After scolding Amane and Chitose, Itsuki turned back to Mahiru, who was sitting stiffly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the sidelines, and bowed his head. "…Um, Shiina, thank you for taking care of our<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Since when did I become your kid?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I should be thanking you, for being such dear friends to Fujimiya," Mahiru answered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gracefully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "C'mon, not you, too! You're making me sound like a worthless jerk."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You kinda are, though," Itsuki remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, screw you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd heard Itsuki say things like that to him before, but Amane was hardly in the mood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    right now. Mahiru could have joined in the banter, but she wisely kept silent and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smiled, content to watch the exchange between the two boys. She wasn't being quite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as expressive as she was when she was alone with Amane, but that smile lifted the veil<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on her usual act just a little bit. Perhaps noticing, Itsuki looked befuddled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane made a crack about Itsuki checking her out despite his being taken, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose started pouting and laid into Amane even harder. It was kind of funny, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had her head tilted in bemusement, so Amane downplayed his enjoyment and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    assumed a more relaxed pose.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…All right, look. We don't have a mushy-sweet relationship like you guys do, but I still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    need you both to understand that this could get really hairy if word got out," said<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Got it; say nothing to nobody." Evidently picking up on his friend's attempts to point<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out the potential danger, Itsuki quickly nodded in understanding, much to Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    surprise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You too, Chitose," Amane added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not that much of a chatterbox, you know. Besides, no one would believe that such<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a cute girl is making dinner and stuff for you of all people."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, excuse me for being so undeserving…," Amane muttered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Geez, I didn't mean it like that!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was well aware that what Chitose was saying was true. It was difficult to accept<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that the star of the school was taking care of an ordinary schlub like him. If anyone did<p></p>
    <p></p>
    believe the story, they'd probably curse Amane's very name for being so undeserving<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of Mahiru's angelic attention. Amane was particularly imaginative when it came to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    visualizing that last part, which was why he really didn't want the truth about their<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relationship getting out. He could do without all the trouble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose laughed at Amane's sudden humility. Then her gaze shifted to Mahiru, as if her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eye had been drawn to something. Chitose let out a heavy sigh as she stared longingly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at the other girl. Mahiru quickly turned uncomfortable, like she wasn't sure what to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    do.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um, what is it?" she asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It just struck me all over again. Shiina, you're ridiculously cute, aren't you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? Thank you very much…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Having praised Mahiru right to her face, Chitose continued to stare, scrutinizing every<p></p>
    <p></p>
    last bit of her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "This is my first time seeing you so close-up, but sure enough, you really are as beautiful<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as an angel, aren't you? Your face has a nice shape, and your skin is lovely and creamy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Plus, your eyelashes are long, your hair is smooth, and you're slim but still curvy!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, um…?" Mahiru managed, flustered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sighed deeply. He couldn't deal with Chitose when she got like this. While the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girl definitely had her merits, there sure were some things he couldn't stand about her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He couldn't put up with her high-energy personality or the fact that she was always<p></p>
    <p></p>
    butting into other people's business.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had a particular appreciation for how difficult she could be because he had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone similar in his family. It was all the ways in which Chitose reminded him of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his mother that really drove him crazy. Undeniably, Chitose resembled Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mother in taste and disposition; she was obsessed with cute things.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wow, seriously, looking closely, you're an incredible beauty—and so cute! Hey, hey,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    can I touch your hair? I mean, do you have a secret to getting your hair so smooth and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shiny? What shampoo and conditioner do you use?" Chitose pressed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wait, ah, um… so sudden…," Mahiru stammered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your skin's so soft, too. What kind of regimen do you follow to keep it like this?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose, who seemed caught between a desire to share beauty secrets and a want to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    poke and prod at the beautiful girl, stretched out a hand toward Mahiru as she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bombarded her with questions.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt sorry for Mahiru, who, despite her discomfort, was powerless against the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    onslaught. Cursing under his breath, Amane lightly bonked Chitose on the head. It was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a just a tap, since the goal was simply to get Chitose to cool her heels, but she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apparently been caught by surprise as she cried "Oww!" and drew her hand back away<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from Mahiru. As for Mahiru, she seemed relieved by Amane's intercession. He'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forgotten about it because she was conducting herself with her usual angelic poise,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but Mahiru was extremely wary around people she wasn't used to. Chitose was a girl,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so Mahiru wasn't as wary as she had been with Amane, but her fear of strangers was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    still quite clear.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can't believe you did that!" Chitose whined.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She's shy, and you've only just met her, so stop trying to touch her," Amane chided.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can touch her once we get to know each other?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You'll need to ask Shiina about that. Be respectful."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had obviously been getting ready to make a run for it. It was a good thing he'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stepped in. Even Chitose seemed to understand why she should stop when she saw<p></p>
    <p></p>
    how clearly shaken Mahiru was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm sorry; I got too excited and almost did something without asking," Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apologized.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, mm-hmm…" Mahiru still seemed upset by the close call, and she looked at Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as if she didn't know what to do, her eyes pleading for help.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, Shiina, Chitose can be sorta a handful, but she's not a bad person… I think," Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is that supposed to be a compliment?" the excitable girl snapped.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look at the way you were acting. Can you really argue?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nope!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose, having just openly disavowed her own actions, stared at Mahiru for a moment,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    then once again extended a hand toward her, wearing a very serious expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "In that case, it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance!" This time, however, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    presented Mahiru with an open hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? Y-yeah, nice to meet you…" Mahiru hesitantly accepted the handshake.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once Chitose took a liking to someone, Amane knew she was determined to be their<p></p>
    <p></p>
    friend, whether they wanted it or not. Something told Amane that Mahiru would be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    swayed by Chitose's persistence. Really, as long as she didn't do anything too weird in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her pursuit of Mahiru's friendship, Amane didn't mind. An ordinary, low-key<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relationship was best.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "First impressions are so important for becoming good friends, you know! You<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably already know who I am, and I'm sure you've heard my name from Amane,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but I'm Chitose Shirakawa. I'm Itsuki's girlfriend. I guess you could call him… Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    best friend?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh my, I'm blushing! A best friend, wow," Itsuki ribbed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't act so flattered, Itsuki; it's weird," Amane shot back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There you go again… Hey, Amane, they've got a name for people like you, y'know…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sweet and sour!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'll seriously kick you out."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Forcing us outside in the snow? Oh, how cruel!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't try to wheedle your way out of this one."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki cackled with laughter, and Amane looked even more annoyed. Mahiru's eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    went wide as she watched their exchange.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, we always act like this," Itsuki informed her as he smiled cheerfully. "So anyway,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'm Itsuki Akazawa. I'm best friends with that knucklehead over there. If Amane ever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    does anything stupid or weird, you can come talk to me any time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is that any way to talk about your best friend?" Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, Fujimiya doesn't seem to have any interest in me," Mahiru said. "He may not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have any basic life skills, but he's an otherwise ordinary guy, so I'm not expecting any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    trouble."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks, I guess… but you could have left out the part about me being incompetent."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could have gone without that specific remark, but he was happy to hear that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru did indeed see him as a person she could trust.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki drew close and whispered in Amane's ear, "You've gotten awfully close to Shiina<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for somebody who says he's not interested."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane would be lying if he said he wasn't interested at all, but he really wasn't actively<p></p>
    <p></p>
    trying to steer their relationship in that direction. He was certain that Mahiru just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wanted a close friend, not a romantic partner. The two of them were happy spending<p></p>
    <p></p>
    their time together as they had been.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Glancing at Mahiru, Amane saw that she'd gotten all flustered again. Chitose had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    begun another round of interrogation, having decided her conversation with Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was over.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, Mahiru didn't seem to hate the attention, and Amane hoped that maybe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    when she got more comfortable, she might relax a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As bewildered as she was, Mahiru responded to the barrage of questions with a small<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smile. It came as no small relief for Amane that the two girls were getting acquainted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    without any issue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm really sorry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After night had fallen, and Itsuki and Chitose had gone home, Amane apologized to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, who looked more than a little worn-out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was obvious that Mahiru had been left exhausted and confused after dealing with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    two strangers who'd just discovered their secret. This conversation felt like an exact<p></p>
    <p></p>
    repeat of the one they'd had after Shihoko's surprise visit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, my own carelessness was what caused it, after all," Mahiru refuted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "They sure did make a fuss."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "They're… lively people."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can be honest; they're both loudmouths."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "They were a little assertive, but they're interesting."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "'A little' is being very generous… Well, as long as you didn't mind, I guess it's all good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was convinced that his friends' behavior had crossed the line for Mahiru, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the mild-mannered girl was taking it all in stride. He was glad that she hadn't found<p></p>
    <p></p>
    them too troublesome, but he wasn't sure whether it was a good thing that she and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose were apparently becoming friends.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose is a totally different type of girl from Mahiru. Very… energetic? Which is nice, I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    suppose. He trusted Chitose not to do anything malicious, but he would need to keep<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an eye on her to be certain she gave Mahiru enough space.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't have any people like that in my life, so it was kind of fun."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Right, I imagine you don't really have anyone like Chitose in your circle… If she gets<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too persistent, you can just slap her, okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I w-would never resort to violence, so I'll do my best to keep her in check with my<p></p>
    <p></p>
    words."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose had an excess of energy and often let her enthusiasm get the better of her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was sure that eventually his advice would be warranted. As he fixed in his mind<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an oath to caution Chitose directly the next time he saw her, Amane turned toward the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    window and watched the snow fluttering down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If it weren't for this weather, we never would've been discovered, he thought. Snowflakes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were supposed to carry good tidings for lovers everywhere, however, so Amane didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    think it right to curse them for his troubles.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru also seemed to enjoy watching the snow because, once she realized what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was looking at, she stared out the window in the exact same way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was winter, so the sun had set early. The sky was dark, and the snow was pale, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he could just barely see the flakes falling in the light coming from the surrounding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment buildings.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A white Christmas, huh?" Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I guess so," Amane answered. "Though, that sappy stuff doesn't have much to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    do with us."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's still very pretty. Isn't that enough?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Spending a romantic white Christmas together didn't mean anything to them, since<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they weren't a couple, but… Mahiru seemed to be enjoying the sight anyway, so the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    snow couldn't be all bad.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The dancing snowflakes lightly dusted the surroundings, leaving the dark world<p></p>
    <p></p>
    coated in a powdery whiteness. At the rate it was falling, the chance of the snow really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    piling up didn't seem very high.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If it's too heavy, though, public transit will shut down, so I hope it's only a light snow,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru commented.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's very pragmatic of you," Amane remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "People can't survive on romance alone," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're exactly right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Albeit in an unusual way, the snow had brought them closer together, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They both smiled slightly, and Mahiru stood up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right then, I'll bring dinner over."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh, bring it over?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I made beef stew at my place earlier. I thought for sure that if I roasted a whole turkey,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the two of us wouldn't be able to finish it…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It would never have even occurred to me to roast a turkey."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're just bad at cooking, Amane. For lunch tomorrow, I was thinking we could make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    omelet rices with beef stew on top."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That sounds so delicious…" Amane's mind had already leaped straight past tonight's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dinner and had started looking forward to tomorrow's lunch. "I like my eggs cooked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hard."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What a coincidence; I've always preferred them that way, too. Okay, I'm bringing the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stew pot over."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru sauntered out of Amane's apartment and headed back to her own place for a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    moment. Vacantly, Amane watched her as she left, reflecting on the turbulent day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He really hadn't expected to be discovered. His friends might have suspected that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something was up, and Amane had anticipated them growing curious, but he never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would've expected that Mahiru would simply step right onto center stage.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Part of him wished that their relationship could've stayed their secret for just a little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while longer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What am I thinking? Amane wondered. It was better this way. He no longer had to hide<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything from Itsuki and Chitose, which made his life much easier. So then why did<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he feel a bit wistful? Where was this strange feeling coming from? Though everything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had turned out okay, some part of Amane was still agitated, and he needed to relax.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did something happen?" Mahiru had returned, holding the stew pot, and she tilted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her head questioningly as she stared at Amane with a confused look.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's nothing." Amane straightened out his expression, but Mahiru still seemed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    puzzled for a good while by the expression she had spotted on his face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Phew, that was good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unsurprisingly, Mahiru's cooking had been delicious. With it being Christmas, she had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    made even more elaborate dishes than usual. She had turned the rest of her carefully<p></p>
    <p></p>
    simmered beef stew into a pot pie, which she and Amane had shared.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Splitting the pie open and eating the crispy, textured crust together with the rich sauce<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of the beef stew could only be described as a moment of sublime bliss.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had apparently prepared the pie dough especially for this. Truly impressed by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her culinary prowess, Amane loosed a contented sigh while polishing off his second<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pastry of the day, another product of Mahiru's skilled hands.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While making the dough for the pot pie, Mahiru had apparently taken the opportunity<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to prepare another type of sweet dough at the same time. She'd used it to make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    handmade mille-feuille for dessert. This girl was already working at a professional<p></p>
    <p></p>
    level.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm glad you like it… You sure ate plenty," Mahiru observed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm. Because it was delicious," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you for saying so."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had grown accustomed to seeing the faint, relieved smile that emerged on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's face whenever he complimented her food. He had made it his daily mission<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to see that expression, as it was so much softer than her usual reserved countenance.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though an embarrassing thought, Amane liked to think of it as a special kind of smile<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reserved just for him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…So tomorrow we're having omelets over rice, huh…? I'm really looking forward to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really do like eggs, don't you? You tore into those rolled dashi omelets with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    incredible enthusiasm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "They were delicious; I couldn't help it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though eggs were one of his favorite foods, Amane couldn't stand them if they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were badly cooked. The fact that he'd wolfed them down was just more proof of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's excellent preparation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though Amane recognized that it was awfully selfish to be keeping her cooking all to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself, he was not inclined to share with anybody else. The plan was to keep enjoying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it for as long as possible.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Amane, you look super happy when you're eating, you know?" Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course, because your cooking is so good," he replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm flattered, but… really, it's nothing that special."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, it definitely is… You need to get a better sense of your own worth…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This was the homemade food of an angel; there were more than a few boys who'd do<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anything to have some.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But to me, this is just the stuff I make every day."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm a lucky guy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Why's that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Because the stuff you make every day is so delicious."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was a boy ruled by his stomach, and being able to enjoy delicious, freshly made<p></p>
    <p></p>
    meals so regularly was, for him, the ultimate happiness.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How did you get so good at cooking anyway?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Someone important to me once said 'Make sure you grab anyone who makes you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    happy by the stomach,' and I took those words to heart," Mahiru answered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry you ended up grabbing me instead."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm thinking of it as a rehearsal." Mahiru's candor caught Amane by surprise. A small<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smile spread across her lips.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…But seriously, whoever taught you must have been amazing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's right; they were an incredible cook. I'm still no match for them. Their cooking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tasted like pure happiness." Mahiru took on a faraway look with a gentle smile. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression felt reassuring to Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    From the way Mahiru described it, the person in question had obviously loved her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    very much, and Amane could tell that Mahiru had idolized them as well. She must have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been really lucky to have someone like that in her life.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I bet it was really good," Amane said, nodding. "But you know… to me, your cooking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is what tastes like happiness."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Leaving his mother aside for the moment, Amane's father was a decent cook, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's dishes suited Amane's tastes better. Mahiru's cooking was comforting yet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exciting, with a relaxing flavor that he didn't think he could get tired of, even if he had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it three times a day for the rest of his life. No matter how much he ate, he just wanted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more and more.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though, of course, he could never say that. It'd put too much of a burden on Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Suddenly, the girl stiffened. She looked like she'd been attacked in an unguarded<p></p>
    <p></p>
    moment. She stared at Amane with an innocent and somewhat vacant expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Mahiru?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah… it's nothing." Snapping back to her senses, Mahiru quickly shook her head, then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stared down at the floor. Hugging her favorite cushion tight, she let out a soft sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something about her had completely changed in the last few seconds. It was strangely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    endearing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What's up?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's just—to think that someone like me could make something taste like happiness…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't know why you're putting yourself down, but your food is so good that I want<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to eat it every day."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Th-thank you." Mahiru looked up at Amane with a bit of a bashful look and a small<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grin. The sight of it filled Amane with the urge to hide his face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This kind of expression was rare for Mahiru, but it inevitably set Amane's heart<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rattling in his chest, even though he'd constantly told himself that he wasn't interested<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in her like that. Seeing Mahiru's smiling visage stripped of its usual stony mask made<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him suddenly feel hot, and Amane worried that she would notice and get embarrassed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Say, um, Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Tomorrow we'll be meeting up around lunchtime, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unable to stand the atmosphere any longer, Amane forced a change of subject. Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't seem to take much notice, however, and she idly considered what Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, that's the plan, isn't it? We'll make lunch, then play games like we promised…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was it, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Unless… you don't want to?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I was just confirming. Really, even though we spent Christmas Eve together, are<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you sure it's okay to spend your next day with me, too?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If I hated the idea, I wouldn't have suggested it… I'm looking forward to it." Another<p></p>
    <p></p>
    small smile appeared on the gentle curve of Mahiru's lips.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yeah," Amane muttered. It was all he could do to turn away and hide his growing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    embarrassment.<p></p>

    14 Christmas for Two<p></p>
    When Mahiru arrived at Amane's apartment the following day, she seemed a little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    restless. It would've been perfectly understandable to be nervous about visiting the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    home of a member of the opposite sex on a holiday, but that didn't seem to be it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru wants to play games. She's probably just excited.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, this would be her first time ever playing a video game. In some ways, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was like a sheltered highborn young lady who knew little of the world at large.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Before we play, I'll make lunch, okay?" Mahiru confirmed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm. I'll have mine well-done, please," Amane answered casually.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know; I remember."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even dealing with such a demanding customer didn't seem to dampen the girl's mood.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With a flutter of her apron, she headed for the kitchen and began preparations for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lunch. From the way she was behaving, Mahiru seemed to be quite pleased.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt a little awkward and embarrassed about how much he had been looking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forward to this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It's just because I'm looking forward to enjoying the games, that's all, he told himself. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certainly was not that he had been excited about spending time alone with the nextdoor angel. As he watched Mahiru's ponytail swaying back and forth, Amane smiled<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wryly to himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…How are you supposed to hold it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After lunch, the two of them settled on the sofa in front of the TV. Both were now<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looking straight at the screen.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane had asked her what game she wanted to play, it became apparent that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't even know where to start, so he'd booted up a well-known 2D game and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    handed her a controller. Unfortunately, Mahiru immediately got flustered as it became<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apparent that she had no idea what to do with it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, okay, so you move around with this joystick, and you jump with this button…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, usually so calm and collected, was looking back and forth between the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    controller and the TV as she manipulated her character on-screen. It was obvious that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this was her first time. She charged straight at the enemies without dodging, dying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    over and over again. Amane began to wonder if perhaps there were things even an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    angel couldn't do, though she did seem to be gradually improving, if ever so slowly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I can't win," Mahiru professed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Never mind clearing the stage—you haven't even defeated the first enemy," Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    observed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it's just a matter of practice; you gotta keep trying. Get that muscle memory."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane warned Mahiru that it would be a challenge, but she didn't seem ready to give<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up. It was charming to watch the girl tackle the game with such a serious expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't help but smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unfortunately, Mahiru was just too much of a beginner and kept on losing. Eventually,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it was obvious that she was growing frustrated. As she shot a glance at Amane, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could have sworn he heard a gamelike sound effect accompany her sullen face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, here, you need to do it like this…" Mahiru was sure to lose interest if she continued<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to metaphorically bash her head against a wall, so Amane put his hand on the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    controller she was holding and tried to physically show her what to do.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had cleared this game on countless occasions, so he was able to help Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    get through tough spots. Surprisingly, Mahiru was actually worse than the average<p></p>
    <p></p>
    player. Most people wouldn't have gotten stuck nearly as many times as she did, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane kept that thought private.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look, this enemy moves at a consistent speed in an irregular pattern, but if you watch<p></p>
    <p></p>
    here, he moves toward your character and speeds up as he approaches. Just watch<p></p>
    <p></p>
    your timing and jump."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane put his hand over Mahiru's smaller one and gripped the controller to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    manipulate the character on the TV, showing her how as he explained. On the screen,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the game character moved as Amane had said it would, avoiding the oncoming enemy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't much of a move, but it was apparently enough to impress Mahiru, who let out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a small gasp of astonishment. Her eyes, rimmed with long lashes, snapped wide open,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and her expression brightened.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The two were sitting closer together than they ever had before, and Amane noticed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for the first time that Mahiru's lower lashes were fairly long, too. Smiling, he watched<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru happily play.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane admired her beautiful profile, Mahiru turned toward him, possibly because<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she'd felt his eyes on her. He'd needed to get close in order to be able to reach the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    controller, so the two had ended up far nearer to each other than either had expected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Their arms and hands were even touching, and Amane could feel Mahiru's breath<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lightly grazing his skin. Amane found himself surrounded by warmth and a faint, sweet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fragrance.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "S-sorry…" Amane suddenly realized that his hands were almost completely covering<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's, and he pulled away in a panic, while Mahiru's eyes darted around the room<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as if she had only just realized they were touching at all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Blinking dramatically, Mahiru replied, "No… it's fine. I'm the one who should apologize."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The girl's cheeks had flushed scarlet, and Amane was filled with regret over what he'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    done.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru wasn't a fan of physical contact. No matter how used to each other they had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gotten, having someone touch her hands like that had probably been too much for her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thankfully, while she looked fairly embarrassed, she didn't appear upset or angry.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Really, I'm sorry," Amane said again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um, I'm not that bothered by it…," Mahiru said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't you hate physical contact?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I was surprised but not upset. It's not like you're a stranger."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It seemed that today, the magnanimous angel had seen fit to forgive Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    transgression. Relieved at how easily Mahiru let it go, Amane restarted the game.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Fixing his eyes on the TV screen, Amane got ready to help Mahiru make some real<p></p>
    <p></p>
    progress in the game this time. Then he saw that her character had fallen off the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stage—a rather predictable outcome. Amane was seriously beginning to wonder if he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could do anything to help her get better.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In the end, Mahiru somehow managed to clear one level, whining all the while. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    two of them agreed that was probably a good stopping place for the time being.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If Amane kept making a total beginner face death, it would have a considerable effect<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on her motivation. His plan for now was to get her to try another game and loosen up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, you're tilting."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    To that end, next Amane had suggested a racing game, since that had some grounding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in the real world, but Mahiru was leaning with her entire body.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no gyroscopic control element to the game, so there was absolutely no need<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to physically move around. Amane wasn't sure whether Mahiru even noticed what she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was doing, but she swayed left and right with every turn she made in the game.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In contrast to the earlier game, this one was all about driving a car, and Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought it'd be easier, since pretty much everyone understood the concept of driving<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to some degree. Playing through the tutorial also might've helped, because even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though Mahiru's driving was a bit clumsy, she was able to handle the actual gameplay.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was trying her absolute hardest to perform well. Her body swayed this way and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that while she maintained a very serious expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This is ridiculously cute, Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was strangely adorable, rocking back and forth like a pendulum. Her intense<p></p>
    <p></p>
    focus and effort only made her look even cuter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With every turn, Mahiru's body automatically leaned way to the side. Eventually, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tumbled right onto Amane's lap, and he was forced to choke down a laugh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You really don't need to tilt your whole body, you know?" he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I-it wasn't on purpose," Mahiru replied sheepishly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I know. But still, you were leaning pretty far."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru sat back up, somehow keeping her trembling, pouty lips in check.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The girl had felt soft and light when she'd accidentally flopped on him. That much was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to be expected as Mahiru had a small build, but she was so slim that sometimes Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    worried she might snap in half.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Roused out of Amane's lap, Mahiru's cheeks were flushing, and her body was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    trembling, likely from embarrassment. It was times like these that the girl really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    resembled a small animal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Finally, Amane couldn't stand it anymore, and he burst into a fit of laughter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A-are you making fun of me?" Mahiru demanded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, no. I was just thinking how charming you are."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So you are making fun of me!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You think I'd mock someone while they're trying their best?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "See? You were just very cute; that's all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…When you say cute, I'm sure you mean childish."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was a bit of a peevish overtone to Mahiru's words, and Amane was worried she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    might get depressed if he teased too much; thus he decided to keep any further<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thoughts to himself. He flashed Mahiru a half smile in response to her expression of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    disapproval, and she quickly turned away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Any trace of the angel's gloomy mood vanished instantly when she returned to the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    game. Her intense concentration overrode everything else on her face. It was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    becoming clear that she was getting used to the game, as she was managing to keep<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up with the other cars, if a little awkwardly. Amane had been right to assume a more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    familiar concept like steering a car was better for Mahiru. She did still veer off course<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into the dirt or slam into a wall a few times, though.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been worried she might end up running the whole course backward, since<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she'd never played a game before, but he was relieved to see that she was making<p></p>
    <p></p>
    better progress than he'd expected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Trying to play the racing game together with Mahiru proved to be a little difficult, as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she kept distracting Amane without realizing it. As she tilted her whole body back and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forth with the game, she occasionally leaned right into him. Each time she did so, a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lovely scent would waft over him, making it difficult to keep his composure.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even with the unusual handicap, Amane still managed to maintain a huge lead. They<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were competing against the weakest computer opponents, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…How are you so fast?" Mahiru inquired.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Practice and experience," Amane replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After playing the game so many times, Amane knew the course by heart and understood<p></p>
    <p></p>
    how to best navigate the turns. Even with Mahiru's outside interference, he was able<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to seize every advantage and hold the lead without much trouble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Glancing back at Mahiru, who appeared utterly dumbstruck, Amane quietly switched<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the game to solo mode and dropped out of the competition. Mahiru didn't have enough<p></p>
    <p></p>
    experience, so Amane thought it'd be better to play together after he let her practice<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by herself for a while. It was better that she got comfortable playing against computercontrolled characters rather than feel disappointed over losing to Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thankfully, it was clear that Mahiru had no shortage of determination, and she stared<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enthusiastically at the screen even after going to solo play. With an attitude like that,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was sure she would quickly learn to hold her own against a computer opponent.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was obvious what a hard worker she was, even with something like a video game.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Such perseverance was rather charming, but whenever Amane let a smile slip onto his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    face, Mahiru would quickly take notice and slap his knees in protest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he laughed too much, amused by her protests, Mahiru would frown and grumble,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, you idiot."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I won."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After two hours of dogged perseverance, Mahiru crossed the finish line as the words<p></p>
    <p></p>
    FIRST PLACE flashed across the screen. She turned to look at Amane, obviously proud<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After a hard-won battle with the racing game, Mahiru had achieved the glory of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    finishing first.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though she'd ended up in last place on so many earlier tries, Mahiru had refused to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quit and kept going, improving her ranking bit by bit until at last, she won. Such<p></p>
    <p></p>
    investment had probably made the victory quite emotional.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's expression seemed to proclaim "I did it!" and Amane dutifully clapped in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    admiration.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's great. I could tell you really tried hard," he praised.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yep!" Perhaps because Mahiru was enjoying the praise, her usual demeanor had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    softened, and she appeared a little bashful. She didn't break into a huge, obvious grin<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but instead wore a fleeting, shy curl of the lips that looked ever-so-slightly pleased. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed so sweet that it was hard to believe it belonged to the same cool, reserved<p></p>
    <p></p>
    person.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recently, Mahiru had been acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect<p></p>
    <p></p>
    young lady. Today most of all, she was really acting like a kid. Her cherubic smile had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something innocent about it, and looking at her, Amane felt his sense of reason begin<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to give way as the roaring desire to hold her close rose within him. The urge to pet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru like a cat seized control of his arm, and before he knew it, Amane found himself<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reaching out toward her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is something the matter?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Quickly, Amane regained control of his wayward limb. "Ah, n-no, it's nothing. You really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    got good at this, h-huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm getting better?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For sure. You're way better than when you first started."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you. It was a lot of fun, so I guess I got pretty engrossed." Mahiru chuckled to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane avoided making eye contact by crossing the room and retrieving a small box<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from a basket on the shelf. "Let's say this is your prize for first place," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, um, that's really not—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you don't like the idea of a prize, then think of this as something left behind by a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stout old man with a white beard and a red suit."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was a Christmas present that Amane had carelessly forgotten to give Mahiru the day<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Mahiru's birthday and Christmas weren't that far apart, Amane had expected<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some difficulty picking out this second gift. Thankfully, he'd also gotten a little more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    familiar with the practice, so it surprisingly wound up not being as tough to choose a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Christmas present as it had been finding one for Mahiru's birthday.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru blinked rapidly, as if the reference to a Christmas present had just reminded<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her that today was in fact Christmas, and she nervously accepted the box. At Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    urging, she carefully undid the wrapping.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Well, it's nothing special, though, Amane thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She opened the box and slowly took out the gift. It was a leather key holder.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Expecting Mahiru to feel uncomfortable if Amane got her something too expensive,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had avoided getting a fancy brand-name item. He'd selected this one purely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because the design seemed like it would suit Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was simple, with flowers and ivy carved into the leather, making it perfect for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everyday use. Amane wasn't too well versed in flowers, so he didn't know exactly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    which ones were featured in the design, but he thought their dainty forms suited<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru well, and that's why he'd chosen it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I gave you my spare key and all. If you don't want to use it, that's okay, too,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I definitely will, thank you. You've got a better sense of style than I expected,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What do you mean, better than expected?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, normally you just wear sweatpants or jeans… It's not like you're into fashion<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I just don't own anything besides functional clothes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Getting dressed up in nicer outfits was a tedium that Amane avoided whenever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    possible. He'd never had the occasion to show Mahiru what he looked like in better<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clothing, so she'd only ever seen him in his school uniform and casual house clothes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was no wonder she assumed he had no fashion sense. Such a guess had been right<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the money, and Amane didn't seem likely to dispel that slovenly impression<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anytime soon.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…If you made an effort, you'd probably look pretty good, you know? You kept up your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    appearance in middle school, didn't you?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That was because my mom forced me to… Wait, how do you know that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shihoko sent me this picture and said, 'Here's what he could look like if he tried'…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Unbelievable."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was shocked to see the photo of the time his mother had dressed him up and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brought him to work. Silently, Amane cursed his mother's indiscretion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…That style didn't suit me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose you're right, Amane. You know, you never make eye contact, and your face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is always hidden behind your hair, but I think you have rather distinguished features…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's small hand stretched out toward Amane's face, and her white palm brushed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    against his forehead as she pushed his long bangs upward. She was looking at him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with a curious expression. He didn't think his face was anything to marvel over; it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    perfectly ordinary—not quite ugly and not quite handsome. Amane began to wonder<p></p>
    <p></p>
    why Mahiru was staring so intently at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What is it?" he asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing. Your eyes look livelier than they used to, that's all," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without looking away, Mahiru reminded Amane that several months earlier, his face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had been vacant like a zombie's.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While Mahiru continued to stare, Amane was beginning to feel uncomfortable that a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girl, not to mention an incredible beauty, was staring at him so intently. He wondered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    what she found so fascinating about his boring looks.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Eventually, he couldn't stand it anymore. Amane slowly reached out and brushed a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lock of hair away from Mahiru's own lovely face. He was hesitant to touch her, but she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had reached out and touched his hair so casually that he thought she'd probably<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forgive him for doing the same. It would only be the faintest moment of contact; surely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that much would be all right.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But wow, she really is beautiful…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was much prettier than the glamorous models in the magazines that had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    previously been scattered around Amane's room—and much more appealing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Something about her felt amazing every time he looked upon her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Photographs, Amane knew, couldn't be trusted anyway. Even if they could capture a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    moment of beauty, preserving it in time, photographs could be made to deceive.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, however, was standing there before him in the flesh. Her beauty was real—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unadulterated. Amane didn't think he could ever get tired of beholding such a creature.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane continued studying her features, Mahiru's eyes started to shift, and she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pulled away from him, dropping her controller. Amane wondered what was bothering<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her as she hugged a nearby couch cushion tight against her chest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um. So… right. I have a Christmas present for you, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um, oh, thanks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was about to ask what on earth it might be, when Mahiru cut him off by pulling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out a nicely decorated gift bag from her purse. Hastily, she pushed it into his hands.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, I'm going to prepare dinner."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh? Y-you are…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With those words, Mahiru quickly stood and moved to the kitchen. Amane was left<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with nothing but bewilderment at the overly rapid development.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After Amane finished washing the dishes from dinner, he returned to the living room<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to find that Mahiru was restless. She was sitting beside him, in the way they had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    recently grown accustomed to, but this time, Mahiru was having trouble maintaining<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her composure. She'd been averting her gaze all through dinner, too.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This was a kind of self-consciousness that Mahiru had seemed previously incapable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of, prompting Amane to wonder if something had happened. Perhaps it had something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to do with her giving him the gift? When Amane had given Mahiru the teddy bear, he,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too, had felt like running away, and it'd been difficult for him to calm down. Maybe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was experiencing a similar sort of anxiety.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "By the way, can I open this?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "P-please do."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane picked up the gift from where he'd left it sitting atop the coffee table, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru nodded somewhat hesitantly. Concluding that she was indeed nervous about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    giving him a present, Amane untied the ribbon fastening the bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Right away, he could tell from the feel and weight that it was something made out of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cloth. When Amane pulled it out and saw it to be a length of black-and-white<p></p>
    <p></p>
    houndstooth, he wasn't sure what it was. After spreading out the whole object,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    however, he immediately understood.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A scarf?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It appeared to be quite soft and luxurious. Surely, this would keep him warm if he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wound it around his neck.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, you're indifferent to fashion, and you always seem cold on the way to school,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can really use it; and wow, it feels so nice."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Quality is important when you're choosing something that you'll be using every day,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Mahiru was someone who only wore high-quality clothes, Amane was sure she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    knew what she was talking about. Mahiru seemed like the type who considered it a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    waste of time to buy cheap things, preferring to use well-made products that would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    last for a long time, instead. If this scarf met her standards, it had to be very nice<p></p>
    <p></p>
    indeed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could tell just by touching it that the scarf had a luxurious texture and was soft<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough not to bother even sensitive skin.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Impressed with Mahiru's high standards, Amane waved the gift at her while she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    watched him with a stiff expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Can I try it on?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I gave it to you, so you can do whatever you like," Mahiru answered curtly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Roger."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane smiled at her blunt response and wrapped the scarf around himself. He could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feel the quality of the fabric even more on his neck, where the skin was more sensitive.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It kept all the warmth in without letting too much air pass through. The feel of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fabric was soothing and snug. As Amane was still inside, it was hard to tell just how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    effective the scarf would be, but he trusted it would undoubtedly keep him comfortable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    throughout the winter months.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wow, it's super warm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's great."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane put on a gentle smile, and Mahiru answered with a relieved smile of her own.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recently, Mahiru had begun to show Amane her many kinds of smiles more frequently,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and he found himself staring again at her enchanting features.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …When she looks like that, she really does seem like an angel…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sure, everyone at school said Mahiru looked heavenly, but Amane thought it was far<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more attractive when she smiled like this and showed her true self.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wh-what is it?" Mahiru had noticed that Amane was staring straight at her. Her eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shifted left and right before fixing themselves back on the one gazing at her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing; I was just thinking that you seem much more relaxed compared to when I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    first met you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Is that so?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked surprised, and Amane laughed a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah. Before, you were all stuck-up and not cute at all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That was terrible of me, not being cute," Mahiru said sarcastically.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on—don't sulk… Now you're way more… How should I put it? I think you just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look better. I was thinking that the way you smile now is way cuter. It's really kind of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a shame you weren't smiling like that sooner."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had always been beautiful, but some quality of that changed in how she carried<p></p>
    <p></p>
    herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The angelic smile that she showed at school had the beauty of something to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    appreciated from a distance. It was a fragile thing that was not be touched.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The cold look that she'd first given Amane held the appeal of something wreathed in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thorns to keep humans from getting too close.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now her soft and innocent smile had a welcoming warmth that made Amane want to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    caress and cherish her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought about how Mahiru had changed. She'd slowly gotten used to being<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around him, and she'd slowly opened up her heart. As he thought back on the time<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they'd spent together, Amane felt a ticklish sensation gradually rising through his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chest and up into his cheeks.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm happy that you can smile so naturally now, and that you've gotten used to hanging<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around with me, and… What are you doing?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's sentence was physically cut off as Mahiru lifted the scarf up from around his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    neck to cover his face with the fabric. She didn't wrap it tight, but it grew a bit stuffy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and hot as the material trapped Amane's breath.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Please just be quiet for a bit," Mahiru commanded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What for?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't understand this sudden outburst of eccentric behavior. He grabbed the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wrist of her hand that was holding up the scarf and pushed it back down. With his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    vision restored, he could see Mahiru's flaxen hair and the tinge of color spread across<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her cheeks, and he noticed that she was trembling slightly. As she looked at him, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grew even more flushed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He wondered why she was making such an odd face, and then it suddenly hit him that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there could be only one answer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Don't tell me… you're embarrassed?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru turned away sharply, which only served to confirm what Amane had said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without meaning to, Amane smiled as he mused that the angel sure could be prickly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about things like this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru groaned and quietly muttered, "I'm going outside for some air." Then she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quickly made for the veranda.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Through the window, Amane could see it snowing just like it had the day before, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't seem to care and stepped out onto the balcony anyway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chilly air rushed into the apartment, and Amane shivered. Though Mahiru immediately<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shut the door, a touch of cold still hung about the living room. Amane let out a quiet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It's fine for her to run away to hide her embarrassment, but she could at least do it in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slightly warmer outfit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had obviously picked her clothes assuming she would be spending the day<p></p>
    <p></p>
    inside—or at least wearing a heavy jacket if she went out. She'd clearly prioritized<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looks over warmth, and her slender body was sure to chill quickly in the cold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane cursed under his breath and picked up the blanket that was lying over the back<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of the sofa.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It's super dangerous to stand outside in the snow wearing such thin clothing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After pulling on his coat, Amane followed Mahiru out onto the veranda and wrapped<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the blanket around her shoulders.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Getting some fresh air is fine, but you'll catch a cold like that," chided Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru quickly turned to face him. "…Isn't that my line?" Clearly, she'd calmed down,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as she'd answered with her usual demeanor and expression, though there was a bit of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a sulking tone to her voice. Maybe she was feeling down because Amane had said<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something that called back to the conversation from when they'd first met.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmph. That only happened because I didn't get in a bath and warm up like I should<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have. Simple negligence," Amane reminded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Next time you get soaked like a drowned rat, make sure you warm yourself up right.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If I'm there, I'll be sure to toss you in the bath myself," Mahiru shot back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What're you, my mom?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There were definitely times when Mahiru said some rather motherly things.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With a smile, Amane recalled his first encounter with the angel. It'd been around the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    time autumn usually started getting cold, about halfway through October. He hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expected to come down with a fever just from getting a little wet, but the weather had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gotten chillier far faster than it usually did back in his hometown. Thinking back on it,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane admitted to himself that perhaps he really had been careless.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The most surprising part of the whole situation, however, had definitely been Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nursing him back to health.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Y'know, it's already been two months since we started talking…," Amane said<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wistfully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're right. And to think, your room was so dirty! It was terrible… Now it only haunts<p></p>
    <p></p>
    my memories," Mahiru quipped.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, hush. I'm keeping it clean now, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And who do you owe for that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why, Lady Mahiru, of course. It makes me want to bow down in humble gratitude."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't need to do that, geez."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Back on that rainy day, Amane would never have believed that he and Mahiru would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    get to a point where they could banter like this. It all seemed so long ago now, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really, it had only been a short while back. A lot had changed in those two months.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Time had really flown by.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A silence fell over the two, and suddenly, everything was quiet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The snow, which had been starting and stopping in fits since yesterday, was now<p></p>
    <p></p>
    drifting softly down from the sky, painting the surrounding apartment buildings in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pale hue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane and Mahiru's building was in residential area, plus it was Christmas, so the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    area was hushed. From some apartment nearby, the pair could very faintly hear the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sounds of a Christmas song, though not well enough to decipher any lyrics.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru exhaled a little white puff, and Amane's ears caught that sound better than any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    other.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's kind of a strange feeling." Mahiru was the one to break the silence. "At first, I was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wondering 'What's up with this guy?'"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I guess that's not surprising. Anyone would be suspicious if someone suddenly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forced an umbrella on them… What do you think now?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm, let's see. I'd have to say… you're a whole lot of work." Mahiru turned away after<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her ambiguous answer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're not wrong." Amane smiled while leaning against the veranda railing. "…You<p></p>
    <p></p>
    know, I never thought that we would get close enough to be eating meals together like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this, either. To be honest, I always thought of you as someone to be admired from a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    distance. I never considered ever getting involved with you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That was certainly honest… though I knew that already. That's precisely why I trust<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you," Mahiru said, and her body shook with laughter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane knew that Mahiru only accepted him in her life because he wasn't attracted to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her; and apparently, she felt the same way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Still, I'm glad that I got to know you like this. My life has really improved a ton, I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    happy because I get to eat delicious food every day, and I feel at ease when I'm hanging<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out with you," Amane declared.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You really think so?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I do. I'm incredibly grateful for these past two months. Thank you." Amane couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have been more sincere if he tried. It was thanks to Mahiru that his standard of living<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had gone up and that he got to enjoy a delicious meal every day. Surprisingly, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had also discovered that he could enjoy talking to a girl without any sort of awkward<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expectations. It'd even become something he looked forward to. Even better, Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would occasionally flash him adorable reactions when Amane teased her, and he never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    got tired of those.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recently, she's started to laugh more, too.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane had realized before, Mahiru had indeed started displaying a richer array of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    emotions, a change that only made her more endearing. Amane would never actually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    act on his feelings, of course, but… just looking at her made him feel at peace.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes were wide, and Amane couldn't tell whether the slight redness in her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cheeks was because of the cold or because she was embarrassed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, thank you very much," she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But I didn't do anything." From Amane's perspective, Mahiru was the one who'd done<p></p>
    <p></p>
    everything for him. He was sure he hadn't given the girl anything in return, but she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slowly shook her head in disagreement.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm grateful for things that you aren't aware of, Amane," Mahiru explained.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm… Each of us telling the other what we're thankful for has sort of an end-of-theyear vibe. I guess that's not all that weird, since the year is about to end."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Curiously, both Amane and Mahiru had thanked the other for certain things, despite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the new year still being six days away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes sparkled at the mention of the end of the year, and she let a little laugh<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slip out. "Ha-ha, that's right. It's still a little early, but… Happy New Year, Amane. Let's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    make it a good one."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yeah, Happy New Year." Amane nodded and smiled at Mahiru's heaven-sent proposal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Then Mahiru suddenly said, "I'm freezing; let's go on inside, shall we?" She turned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around and opened the glass door that led back to Amane's living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane caught a glimpse of her ears, which had turned bright red in the frosty air, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he agreed that it was best to retreat inside so as not to catch cold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …One way or another, I guess I've also taken a liking to this lifestyle. That's probably why<p></p>
    <p></p>
    my chest feels so warm. As he followed Mahiru back into the apartment, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    watched the gentle swaying of her soft, flaxen hair and smiled secretly to himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hoped that in the days to come, he would continue to see more of the angel who<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lived next door.<p></p>

    15 A Power Outage, Anxiety, and Warmth<p></p>
    "Ah!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hadn't expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to the television. It was a total blackout.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn't suffered any damage, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he would have to check the other appliances later.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, there was no reply.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Mahiru?" he called out anxiously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    arm… It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    voice come from the floor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What a disgrace…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Um, sorry I startled you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…No. I startled myself; that's all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around and found her original position.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn't seem to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane's shirt<p></p>
    <p></p>
    again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    again. This time, she didn't fall off the sofa.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Looking for something?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Are you being sarcastic?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why in the world would I be?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not that much of an ass."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily—but she was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the hem of Amane's shirt, but she didn't make any moves to brush off his hand. He had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…So I guess you're not a big fan of the dark?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I don't hate it, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm-hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I just don't like it when it's bright one moment and dark the next—that's all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not really afraid of the dark, and I don't feel scared."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure, yeah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru added in a small voice, "…There's just one thing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…When we sit like this, I know I'm not alone, and I feel better," Mahiru mumbled. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sounded relieved.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I see," said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…The power's back on. I'm going to check my appliances."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's hold and stood up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears<p></p>
    <p></p>
    poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small "Thank you" and couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    help but stare at her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's weird," he muttered as he turned away bashfully<p></p>
    <p></p>

    16 Spending the End of the Year with the Angel<p></p>
    Once Christmas had passed, the whole world could feel the end of the year approaching.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The day after spending Christmas with Mahiru, Amane went out to do a bit of shopping<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on his own. By the time he was finished, his surroundings had undergone a dramatic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shift, and Amane admired the new scenery on his way home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The lights strung up around the city remained, but the ornamented trees and Christmas<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decorations had already been replaced with more traditional Japanese adornments.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The shops had also updated their merchandise, selling New Year's decorations and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    foods. If there were any Christmas things still in stock, at best they had been reduced<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in price and were displayed under INVENTORY CLEAR-OUT SALE labels.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane nestled his face deeper into the billowy folds of his scarf as he pondered the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sudden changeover. Mahiru had given him the monochrome houndstooth-patterned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    scarf as a Christmas present. It was both practical and tasteful; it looked stylish and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    felt very nice to the touch, and most importantly, it kept the chilly winter winds at bay.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had never really worn a scarf before, so he was feeling grateful for this one as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he checked over the contents of the shopping bags hanging from his arms.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though the two of them were supposed to share this responsibility—in order to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reduce the burden on Mahiru, who did all the cooking—Amane usually went out to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    buy the ingredients, armed with a shopping list.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was a cold day, and Amane's bags were stuffed with vegetables and mushrooms and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    meat—Mahiru must have been planning to make a hot pot. The plentiful vegetables<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were her way of wordlessly insisting that Amane eat a more balanced, nutritious diet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He laughed quietly to himself, amused that Mahiru was somehow still looking out for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him even when she wasn't actually present.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He checked again to be sure that he'd gotten everything, then quickly returned home,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shivering against the relentless cold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Welcome back."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was already evening when Amane entered his apartment, and Mahiru was there to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    greet him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was kind of a strange feeling, being welcomed into his own apartment, but recently<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had gotten used to it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm, I'm back… I bought some thinly sliced mochi; I hope that's okay?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You want to cook it in the hot pot, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah. I also got some ramen to finish off the meal."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…There's no way I can eat that much, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't worry, I'll make sure it doesn't go to waste."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had never been the type to eat huge meals before, but now, thanks to Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooking, he had started enjoying more sizable dinners. In fact, he found his new<p></p>
    <p></p>
    portion sizes a bit concerning and had resolved to start weight training.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed to be watching her diet as well. She rarely prepared any fattening<p></p>
    <p></p>
    foods. On the other hand, she also seemed to think that Amane could stand to put on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a bit of weight, since he was so slim. Amane hoped he would add muscle and not fat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, if you're going to finish it, then that's fine. Here, give me the bags. I'll put the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    things in the fridge. You go wash your hands."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know, I know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane handed the full shopping bags to Mahiru and obediently headed for the sink.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come to think of it, what are you doing for New Year's, Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After finishing every last bite of the day's delicious meal, as always, Amane suddenly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asked Mahiru the question that had been weighing on his mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "New Year's… Well, there's no point in going home, so I'll be here."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He realized his blunder when he heard her indifferent tone, but Mahiru didn't actually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seem all that bothered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her relationship with her parents wasn't good, so she always had a cold attitude<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whenever the conversation turned to her family.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But if that's the case, won't Mahiru be spending the holiday alone?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had his standing promise to show his face at home once every six months, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had been planning to visit during the long break—that was before he had met<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're going back home, right, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's right; I'm pretty much under orders to show up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He glanced over at her and saw that the expression in her eyes was somewhat chillier<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than usual. She seemed to have resolved herself to spending the holiday alone, what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with Amane going away and all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Man, when I get home, I'm gonna get absolutely grilled about you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How terrible…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can probably get by with just giving my dad the basics, but my mom is going to want<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to hear a whole lot more."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's awfully strange, since I talk to her all the time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really got familiar with my mom in no time…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For some reason, Mahiru had made fast friends with Amane's mother and, without<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him noticing, had been sending her photos and private stories… which frankly killed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him a little inside. But Mahiru obviously enjoyed it, so Amane didn't see any harm in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it. He only hoped she wasn't telling his mother anything more than she absolutely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    needed to know.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recalling the distant, lonely expression that crossed Mahiru's face from time to time,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane decided that he didn't want to leave her here alone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I did just see Mom a little while ago… I would miss seeing Dad, but I wonder if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it would be all right if I didn't go home for the New Year… Besides, I'm supposed to go<p></p>
    <p></p>
    back during spring vacation anyway."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was thinking that if he stayed here for the holiday, they could continue having<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dinner together like always… that is, if it wasn't too much of an imposition on Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Oh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm. Plus, I want to eat your New Year's noodles."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What a glutton you are."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's all because of your cooking."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Even when it's ready-made?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even if she only boiled the prepackaged soba noodles, Amane was sure he would still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enjoy them. Because the important thing about their shared meals was the time they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    spent together.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're an awfully strange person," Mahiru remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, hush."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He saw her smile slightly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What for?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For whatever."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't say anything further, but her expression brightened somewhat, and she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    squeezed her favorite cushion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    And then December 31 arrived. New Year's Eve was bringing the year to a close. For<p></p>
    <p></p>
    many, it was a busy day, spent cleaning and preparing for the year to come, but—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um, hey, Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What is it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Are you sure you don't want me to help with anything?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    From his position sitting comfortably on the living room couch, Amane was gazing at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's back as she was standing apron-clad in his kitchen. She had been in there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    since that morning, making osechi, the traditional fare for the New Year holiday.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since they had decided to ring in the New Year together, naturally they needed enough<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to feed two.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had assumed they would be purchasing it premade, but apparently Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    intended to make it all by hand. That would have been quite a task even for a skilled<p></p>
    <p></p>
    homemaker, so it was surprising for even this brilliant high school girl to tackle it all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    alone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was seriously impressed, but Mahiru had said, "Well, there's no way we can get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    osechi from a store now. You have to order it well in advance."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Admittedly, she was absolutely right, but even so, Amane admired Mahiru for deciding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to make everything herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, she took shortcuts where she could. For instance, boiling their own black<p></p>
    <p></p>
    soybeans would be very time-consuming and keep one burner occupied for far too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    long, so they had bought some prepared soybeans instead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, you seem uncomfortable whenever I say you don't have to do anything, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    do you have any idea how you might go about helping me?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Honestly, no clue."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I thought so. It's easier if you just stay out of the way."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't really argue with Mahiru's harsh assessment, so he tried to sit quietly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the sofa, but he found it impossible to settle down and do nothing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't that Amane hadn't done anything at all—he'd finished cleaning his apartment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the day before, and earlier he'd gone on a big shopping run, picking up ingredients for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the osechi dishes along with enough food so that they wouldn't have to go out for a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while. He had taken care of the more physical tasks, but at the moment, Mahiru was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    busy, and he wasn't doing much.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You must be tired from moving all the furniture and appliances yesterday to clean, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    please, just take it easy," Mahiru said without turning around, though Amane thought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he heard a note of concern in her voice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It appeared that Mahiru had already finished her own New Year's cleaning. Apparently,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it hadn't taken much work at all since she always kept her place so tidy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So that's the difference between someone who makes a habit of keeping things clean and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone who doesn't, Amane mused. Guess I should've realized that earlier…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, even so, I feel bad about it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I really like cooking, so it's no trouble."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Still…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine; I'm having fun."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was at a loss for how to react to Mahiru, who brushed him off, fully absorbed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in her work.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, I went ahead and bought lunch."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It would have been unfair to expect Mahiru to prepare lunch when she had her hands<p></p>
    <p></p>
    full with the osechi, so Amane had gone to the convenience store. He'd figured there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would be no problem with a simple meal of sandwiches, since Mahiru didn't eat that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much anyway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had already taken off her apron. She must have been planning to take a break,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so the timing seemed just about perfect.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks for going to the trouble," Mahiru said as she stepped into the living room. Her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    break would double as lunchtime. "I'm really sorry for not getting around to making<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lunch."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, I'm definitely the one who should be apologizing, with you making all that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    osechi. Here, let's eat. How's a sandwich and cafe au lait sound?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's fine, thank you," Mahiru said as she accepted the food, then took a seat beside<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him on the couch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So about how much have you gotten done so far?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I'm using a lot of premade ingredients, and I'm trying not to limit the number<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of dishes, so… I'd say I'm nearly finished. After this, there are a lot of things that need<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to rest or chill in the fridge. You seem to like sweet rolled omelets, Amane, so I made<p></p>
    <p></p>
    those by hand."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How did you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You like all the other egg dishes I make. I didn't think that rolled omelets would be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the exception."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He surmised that she had cooked them specially in the oven. He had heard it humming<p></p>
    <p></p>
    earlier and wondered what she was making.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You like the ones that are slightly sweet, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You know me too well."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not surprising that I would learn your tastes after several months," Mahiru said<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as she bit into her ham and lettuce sandwich. It made him very happy to hear that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane started eating the rice ball he had bought for himself, he looked over into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the kitchen. His eyes landed on the smallish multitiered food boxes that Mahiru had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brought over with her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She must be planning to pack the food into those boxes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hadn't expected her to go so far as to bring out the special boxes for all the food—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    after all, she lived alone, just like him—so he had been a little shocked to see the fancylooking containers all painted with lacquer and decorated with gold leaf.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Seriously, I can't thank you enough. How do I put this…? This past year, I've gotten to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enjoy food in a way I never could have imagined when I first started living alone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And here I thought you were doing just fine on your own."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Rude. You know better than anyone how I was surviving off convenience store meals."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It certainly wasn't healthy. That's for sure." Mahiru let out an exasperated sigh, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she also wore a knowing smile, which caught Amane by surprise. "Well, now that I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    here," she added, "I won't let you fall back into your old unhealthy habits, all right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Who are you, my mom?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's your own fault for living like that. Next year you're really going to learn how to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eat properly. Do I make myself clear?" Mahiru's eyes shone with sudden enthusiasm.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane realized that she had just announced her intention to spend the coming year<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with him as well. The thought made him feel terribly self-conscious, and he found<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself looking away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, Mahiru must have interpreted that gesture as a reluctance to give up his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slothful ways because she promptly scowled at Amane, who found himself struggling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to awkwardly explain himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru finished making and packing up all the osechi dishes by around sunset and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    then set about preparing the New Year's noodles, which just entailed boiling the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    noodles and readying the toppings, since they had bought precut raw noodles.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She had some kamaboko fish cake left over from the osechi, so that was a perfect<p></p>
    <p></p>
    addition. All there was left to do was parboil the spinach and slice the green onion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The most labor-intensive part was the shrimp tempura, but Mahiru seemed to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    having no trouble as she fried them all up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I also had some kabocha left over, so I'm going to fry that while I'm at it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Man… these are gonna be some serious New Year's noodles."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sometimes it's fun to make stuff like this," Mahiru said as she finished serving up the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    noodles. They looked far more splendid than anything most people would normally<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eat at home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She had made two large pieces of shrimp tempura per bowl, and the bonus kabocha<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tempura was crisped to perfection. There was plenty of spinach and green onion, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the kamaboko fish cake was cut into a decorative fan shape.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane noticed that Mahiru liked to keep her tempura crispy, as both of their portions<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had been placed on separate plates rather than directly in the bowl with the noodles.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was grateful for this small, thoughtful act.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wow!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Please, eat up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Perhaps concerned that the noodles wouldn't be enough to satisfy Amane's appetite,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had also served all the leftover bits from the osechi dishes on a small plate.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane watched Mahiru take her seat, then they both pressed their hands together to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    give thanks for the food before digging into their noodles.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though Mahiru had said that the soba had come premade, she must have picked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out high-quality noodles. Amane could smell the rich fragrance of buckwheat with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    every bite. The broth wasn't too thick or too thin, and it was seasoned so well he sighed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with delight. It warmed him from the depths of his belly. The perfect dish for a cold<p></p>
    <p></p>
    day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah… now this is what the end of the year should feel like…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He took a sip of broth and sighed… mumbling quietly to himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was certainly enjoying the chance to sit back and watch TV while eating his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    noodles, awaiting the arrival of the New Year.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was also his family's custom every year to eat New Year's noodles and spend New<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Year's Eve watching the year-end musical specials on television, so Amane was glad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he could keep the tradition going.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But tonight he was not sitting with his family—instead, there was a beautiful girl<p></p>
    <p></p>
    beside him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "When you eat New Year's noodles, it hits you all at once that the year's really ending,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doesn't it?" Mahiru asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know what you mean…," Amane replied. "So much happened this year."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, he was mostly talking about his burgeoning relationship with Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he'd first started living alone, he couldn't possibly have imagined such a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    beautiful girl fixing him such delicious meals.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, because this was the year you started living alone, right, Amane? That must have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been difficult."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You, on the other hand, never seem to have any trouble, do you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that's because I can more or less do everything for myself. It's a disaster for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone like you, trying to live on your own even though you don't know how to do<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh… that's true, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really are the definition of hopeless, aren't you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The expression on Mahiru's face was gentle as she scolded him, more charming than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exasperated. She didn't seem burdened by taking care of Amane. She just looked…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    content.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I owe you for everything you've done this year."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He repeated the words of thanks that he had said to her on Christmas, and Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smiled slightly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And don't you ever forget it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her quick and unconditional agreement prickled slightly in his chest, but his saving<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grace was that Mahiru clearly didn't mean anything.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I hope you'll help me out next year, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know I'll need to. If I wasn't around, you'd barrel headlong into an unhealthy and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slovenly lifestyle again in no time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can't deny that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…If you're aware of it, then you ought to do better…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'll aspire to do so in the coming year."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even if he did put his mind to it, Amane had a feeling that Mahiru's constant caretaking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would quickly erode any desire to fend for himself. Of course, he couldn't say that out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    loud, so he pushed the thought to the back of his mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd do his best to keep his place tidy, but there was no doubt that he would still be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    depending on her for meals. He had become entirely domesticated, and the fact that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was painfully aware of this development didn't make it any less true. Plus, Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    always laughed at him whenever he said he was going to try to improve himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane made a sour face, but Mahiru just smiled slightly, as if she was savoring the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    moment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The New Year's almost upon us."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Looks like it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They had finished eating their New Year's noodles and sat on the sofa watching the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    annual end-of-the-year musical showcase on television. Before either of them realized<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it, the new day—and the New Year—was just moments away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Time had passed much faster than Amane had expected while he was occupied<p></p>
    <p></p>
    watching Mahiru quietly enjoy the show. Apparently, she wasn't very familiar with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    current pop music, possibly because she didn't watch much TV in general.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The screen switched over to a scene of a temple bell—a clear sign the year was about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to end. The great bell began ringing. Seated next to him, Mahiru quietly listened to the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chimes, eyes lowered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As the bell rang the one hundred and seventh time—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The instant that the new day began, Mahiru turned to him, sat up properly, and bowed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Happy New Year," she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Caught up in the moment, Amane also straightened up and gave her the same formal<p></p>
    <p></p>
    New Year's greeting. "Happy New Year… It feels kind of strange, huh? Spending it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    together."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Heh-heh, I suppose it does," Mahiru replied. "I hope you'll look after me this year as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    well."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course… Though, it feels like I should really be the one asking you that, eh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can't argue with that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru let out a giggle, and Amane shot her a slightly awkward grin. Then the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smartphone he had on his lap began to vibrate. His messaging app had several<p></p>
    <p></p>
    notifications—New Year's greetings had come in from Itsuki and Chitose.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's phone also vibrated. She had only just met his friends and hadn't exchanged<p></p>
    <p></p>
    contact info with Chitose yet, so she must have been getting messages from a friend<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't know.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In recent years, the convenience of sending New Year's greetings via phone message<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had become really popular.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm just going to reply to this."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Same."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane figured that Mahiru had probably received a lot of messages. Yet somehow he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    also had the feeling that she wasn't in the habit of giving boys her contact information.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane watched Mahiru's practiced fingers flit deftly across her phone as she typed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out her responses. "It's times like these that you finally seem like a regular high school<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girl," he remarked before checking his own phone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The messages from Itsuki and Chitose were the bog-standard 'Happy New Year'<p></p>
    <p></p>
    followed by needless prying. "Did you spend the New Year holiday getting friendly with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Lady Shiina?" As usual, Itsuki was disconcertingly perceptive.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sent a reply denying it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Immediately, he got a mocking response from Itsuki, accusing him of lying. For a while,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the two friends carried on a lively text conversation. Itsuki would make certain<p></p>
    <p></p>
    allegations that Amane would deny every time, and then… he felt a weight flop down<p></p>
    <p></p>
    against his upper arm.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A sweet fragrance wafted over him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The sudden contact startled him. He glanced timidly to the side, not believing it could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be true… only to confirm that Mahiru was indeed leaning against him, fast asleep.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    —Wait, wait, wait!<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't say anything out loud, but he was already beginning to panic on the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    inside.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had dozed off at his place before, but who could have ever imagined that she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would do so here and now, right beside him, pressed up against his shoulder?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was obvious what had happened.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They had stayed up quite late, past twelve thirty AM. Mahiru, who observed a strict<p></p>
    <p></p>
    routine, probably wasn't used to being awake at this hour. Moreover, she had spent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    most of the day bustling about making the osechi dishes and must have been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exhausted, even if she didn't show it on the surface. She simply hadn't had the strength<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to fight off the sandman any longer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane completely understood—but to fall asleep now of all times!<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Dozing against Amane's shoulder, Mahiru wore a truly peaceful expression, completely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    oblivious to his confusion and consternation. Her long eyelashes and cute nose and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pink lips all had a soft vulnerability to them that Amane hadn't noticed before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't the first time he'd seen her sleeping face, but he had never observed her from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    such close range, and the sight froze him in place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru…," he said hesitantly. "Mahiru, wake up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no response.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru must have been incredibly tired. It seemed that her fatigue had dragged her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down into the deepest oceans of slumber. He called out to her and nudged her with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his shoulder, but the girl showed no sign of waking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even when he tapped her shoulder and gently shook her body, Mahiru didn't stir.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His attempts to rouse her caused her to start pitching forward after slipping off his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    arm. In a panic, Amane caught her and pulled her back toward him… which was fine,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but now he found himself embracing her. His alarm only grew.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …Wow, she smells amazing…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After dinner, Mahiru had briefly gone back to her place to freshen up, and the floral<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fragrance of her shampoo that mingled with her natural scent was making Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tremendously uncomfortable. And he couldn't help but notice how soft she was,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pressed up against him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was not handling this well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had tried to wake her, but she had fallen too deeply asleep, and he was reluctant to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    try to rouse her more forcefully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What should I do?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The New Year had barely started, and Amane was already facing an unbelievable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dilemma.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He looked down at the girl sleeping in his arms with grim determination. She was still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out cold. She must really trust me to drift off like that without a care, Amane realized. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was enough to make him want to bang his head against the wall in frustration and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    embarrassment as his sense of reason began to fail him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No matter how he tried, his attention kept straying back to the distinct feeling of her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slender body pressed against his. It was firm, but with a feminine softness to it, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had a particularly intoxicating voluptuousness where their chests met…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    —What the heck should I do?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Not only was Amane utterly unprepared for his present situation, the unimaginable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    softness brushing against him was quickly wearing away at any remaining composure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he thought he possessed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This was the first time he had ever realized how soft and supple and nice-smelling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girls could be… and even thinking about how he felt was enough to send his mind<p></p>
    <p></p>
    spinning into chaos. It was like one big feedback loop.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even so, he still felt compelled to do something. He had a feeling that there was not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    going to be an easy way out of this one, so Amane tried to clear his mind and steel his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    resolve.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At the moment, there were three ways he could think of to approach this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    1. Wake Mahiru forcefully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    2. Carry Mahiru home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    3. Let Mahiru sleep in his own bed—and spend the night on the couch himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The first option gave him pause. He didn't like the idea of jostling Mahiru awake when<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was obviously so very tired. What's more, he was the one responsible for wearing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her out, so if it was possible, he wanted to let her rest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At first glance, option two initially seemed like it would be the least awkward, but he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was really uncomfortable with the idea of searching through Mahiru's pockets for the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    key to her apartment and entering a girl's home without permission. He also suspected<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Mahiru would not be too pleased to discover that he'd decided that on his own.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Option three, letting her stay over, was seemed like a safer choice that would be easy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to pull off, but… he was not at all emotionally prepared to have a beautiful girl sleeping<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in his bed. It didn't matter how they normally got along. Amane felt like the innocent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    charm of her sleeping face was driving him mad.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The thought of such a stunning beauty asleep on his pillow was almost unbearable for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this growing boy. Some of the images that crossed his mind were guilt-inducing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Still, there was no denying it was the most promising option and the most considerate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    compromise that Amane could think of.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He steadied himself for the task, then gently wrapped his hands around Mahiru's back<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and under her knees and slowly lifted her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was sleeping soundly and was as light as a feather. Of course he would never say<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so out loud, but Mahiru felt almost ephemeral in his arms.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had learned firsthand that she probably wouldn't wake up too easily, but just in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    case, Amane tried to keep her as steady as possible while he gingerly carried her to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his room. It took both hands to cradle her, so opening the door proved quite the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    challenge, but eventually Amane successfully laid Mahiru on his bed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her delicate body sunk into the mattress.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once Amane had covered her with a blanket and comforter, she was all set up for the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    night. He didn't see any indication she was going to wake up, and all he could hear was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her regular, rhythmic breathing. Her face was beautiful as always, but seeing it so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cherubic in sleep was making Amane's heart jump in his chest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He courteously tucked her in, then crouched down beside the bed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …It's too much.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Having a girl sleeping in his bed, remembering the soft feeling of her body against his,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seeing her adorable and defenseless sleeping face, then realizing just how much she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    must trust him to fall asleep in his apartment—that and a million other things were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    running through his mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, he was grateful she believed in him, but at the same time, he couldn't help<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but think that she only saw him as a safe and hopeless nuisance, a harmless little boy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane glanced over at her and noted the tranquil expression on her sleeping face. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was utterly oblivious to his inner turmoil.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She has no idea how I feel.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    And she's let down her guard too much.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …I could climb into that bed right now if I wanted to…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The thought lasted only a moment before he pushed it out of his mind. Of course it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would be wrong, on so many levels. And he knew that the moment Mahiru woke up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and discovered them sleeping together, she would never talk to him ever again. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shuddered at the thought of her soft eyes turning cold and scornful.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That is definitely a bad idea.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But maybe, instead of that, if… just a little... would be okay, wouldn't it?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He extended a hand toward Mahiru's head.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Smooth, sleek, glossy—those were the words that came to mind as he slid his fingers<p></p>
    <p></p>
    over her long, soft, vibrant hair without hitting a single snag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She must work hard to keep it like this, huh…?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Feeling both admiration and a shudder of fear at the enormous efforts demanded by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    femininity, Amane let his fingertips glide slowly across Mahiru's cheek. Her porcelain<p></p>
    <p></p>
    skin was surprisingly cool, at least compared to Amane's fingers. When the brief<p></p>
    <p></p>
    caress was over, Amane looked down and saw that a slight smile had graced Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tranquil face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good night."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'm sure she'll be surprised when she wakes up in the morning tomorrow… or actually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    today, I guess. Considering what he had just gone through, he figured that she could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    live with a little surprise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I really am hopeless…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane flashed a troubled smile, then gently reached out to stroke Mahiru's soft cheek<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one more time.<p></p>

    17 The Defenseless Angel and the Start of the New Year<p></p>
    When Amane awoke in the morning, all was quiet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He could hear the cries of birds outside, but there was no sign from his bedroom that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was up yet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was already past dawn, but maybe because she was exhausted from the night before,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed to still be sleeping soundly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had only managed to get some brief shut-eye—the persistent thought of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru in his bed made true rest elusive—and he had ended up drifting off, lingering<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the edge of sleep until deciding to get up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The restless night wasn't particularly taxing on him physically, so that was fine, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the whole situation was trying in another way. This was the first time he had ever let<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a girl stay over at his place, never mind having one sleep in his bed. Naturally, he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    incredibly anxious.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …I mean, what am I even supposed to do in a situation like this?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was pretty sure that Mahiru had only allowed herself to fall asleep because she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    considered him a safe and harmless guy, but Amane was a guy nonetheless, a fact that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he wished she would acknowledge more often.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He really regretted not waking her and sending her back home, but it was no use now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sighed and stretched to work out the knots in his body after spending the night<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the sofa, then stood up slowly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For the time being, he thought he would look in on Mahiru. Well, his main goal was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    actually to grab a change of clothes, but he decided to check on her while he was in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Ever so slowly, he opened the bedroom door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Inside, it was quiet. Mahiru was just as he had left her, still sleeping in his bed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If there had been any change, it was that she must have turned over several times in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her sleep, because now she was lying on her side, and her hair was spread across the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sheets like a flowing river of gold.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane knelt down to look at Mahiru more closely. Her sleeping breaths were even and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    serene.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She looks so innocent when she's asleep.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru often wore a calm expression, perhaps because she usually had her guard up,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but… her sleeping face was the picture of tranquility. Again, he felt the urge to reach<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out and pet her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …She really is cute like this…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, she was undeniably beautiful any time of day, but seeing her in such a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    vulnerable state plucked at Amane's heartstrings in a very different way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He wanted to stroke her smooth hair and poke at her soft cheeks.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was usually so proper and reserved, with no gaps or cracks in her facade, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    catching her in a defenseless state like this made him want to mess with her a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without putting any thought into the matter, Amane stretched a hand out toward her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and pressed the tip of his finger against her cheek, which looked so soft. Mahiru's skin<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was as silky as it had been the night before. He almost wanted to go on touching her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    forever. In the back of his mind, he knew he needed to be delicate, but the softness of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her skin was spellbinding and made him want to dote on her…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, who had been sleeping quietly, suddenly let out a hoarse but endearing groan<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and looked at Amane with bleary, caramel-colored eyes… or at least, she seemed to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look in Amane's direction. He thought that her cherubic face appeared even more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    innocent in repose. She stared absently for a moment, eyes blank and cloudy with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sleep, and then frowned and settled back down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane started to pull his hand away, Mahiru stirred, and her cheek brushed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    against his fingers again. "…Nn…" A dainty sigh rose in her throat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    To Amane, it almost seemed like she was saying Don't go.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, Mahiru was obviously still half asleep. She would definitely never act like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this under any normal circumstances.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even so, Amane thought that her movements reminded him of an affectionate kitten.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The day had only just begun, and already his brain was failing him. He couldn't decide<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whether to pull back or keep caressing her cheek. Despite all sense and reason, his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heart was really leaning toward the latter. After all, he rarely got to see Mahiru this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unguarded, and he wanted to see how much he could get away with.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But Amane knew that if Mahiru caught him acting on his desire, she wouldn't listen to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a word he had to say. He knew without a doubt that this would all make her incredibly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    uncomfortable, so he stopped short.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed to be coming around slowly, but she was obviously not awake just yet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She hadn't moved, and her cheek was still pressed against Amane's fingers.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had come into the room looking to check on her and maybe grab a change of clothes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while he was at it. How had he ended up doing something like this? Amane felt his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cheeks grow hot as it fully dawned on him just how unspeakably creepy he was acting.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nn-ngh…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After another moment, Mahiru's eyelids finally started to flutter open again…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Ah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They locked eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's gaze flicked from Amane, who was leaning over her, to his extended finger.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She immediately sat bolt upright.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "M-morning," Amane stammered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…G-good morning…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You fell asleep at my place, so I let you stay the night here, but I didn't have any ulterior<p></p>
    <p></p>
    motives and I swear I didn't do anything, so really, I hope you can appreciate all that…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane said, the words pouring out in a rush as he struggled to explain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As she listened to Amane's jumbled account, Mahiru stayed quiet, but her cheeks<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quickly flushed bright red as it dawned on her where she had slept, and she tugged at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a corner of the futon, practically hiding herself with it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Finding even that small gesture charming, Amane quickly turned away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What is happening here?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though he had lent her a bed for the night, he was starting to feel bad. He knew<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he had been wrong to touch her without permission. But it had only been for a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    moment, and he had absolutely no intention of taking it any further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane looked back at Mahiru. His heart was pounding in his chest. He didn't know if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it was because he was smitten with her or from feeling guilty. He saw that her cheeks<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were still tinged red, and she was staring at him with a sullen look… or not quite sullen.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It seemed like she had something to say to him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Amane, do you like touching my cheeks?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, you touched me at Christmas and then again yesterday when I fell asleep,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…So you were awake the whole time?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The other night, when he had stroked her cheek… he'd thought that she'd been fast<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asleep. That she would never know he'd touched her. But she did, because she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    actually been awake at the time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you see, I briefly woke up just as I was being lowered into bed… Moreover, how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could I do anything else in a situation like that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Weren't you worried about me… doing something?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I never thought you would do anything like that, but… in order to confirm my<p></p>
    <p></p>
    suspicions, I pretended to be asleep."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, falling asleep in front of him had been some kind of test to determine<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whether he was really worthy of her trust. Ultimately, it seemed like she was leaning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    toward yes rather than no, for which he was glad.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hoped she wouldn't test that out again. He really wasn't sure he would do any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    better the next time he was faced with controlling himself when she was that same<p></p>
    <p></p>
    charming vulnerability, either.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, I'm glad you haven't decided I'm totally shady. Also please don't try any more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tests. I am a man, after all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, I kn-know that, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Or maybe you were expecting me to try something?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course not!" Mahiru firmly denied, pulling the comforter back up around her. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was practically shaking, and Amane thought he'd seen her start to blush, just a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He wisely swallowed the urge to make a joke about her being in his bed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For now, it was probably a good idea to give Mahiru some space until she regained her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    composure.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After that inexplicable bout of awkwardness, Mahiru returned to her apartment to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    freshen up before coming back again. But it was obvious that she was still embarrassed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because she refused to make eye contact with Amane. Every time he tried to catch her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gaze, she turned away. Even though she was sitting on the sofa right next to him, it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like she was miles away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Please forgive me," Amane said, stomach twisting in knots.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru quickly glanced over at him, then sighed softly. Maybe she wasn't as upset<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anymore; she was wearing her usual serene expression. "I'm not angry. You don't have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to apologize, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I think—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose I'm mostly upset with myself for being so careless, that's all. I really wish<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you hadn't seen me like that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Like… what? I thought you looked really sweet…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's dreaming face had reminded him why people called her an angel, but more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    importantly, he had discovered that just after she woke up, in the moments between<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sleep and wakefulness, her usual cool and collected demeanor gave way to a youthful<p></p>
    <p></p>
    innocence that he found extremely charming.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If anything, Amane wanted to see her like that again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But it was clear that Mahiru was not happy that he'd seen her with her guard down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Before Amane could argue any further, she bit her lip hard and suddenly whacked him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with a pillow. It didn't hurt or anything—it was obvious that Mahiru wasn't really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    trying—but it caught Amane by surprise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What the heck?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You know, I hate that about you, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hate what? At least tell me what I did wrong."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What you said… That's not the sort of thing that you can just say to a girl so casually,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well it's not like I would say that sort of thing to anyone else…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The only girls Amane knew were Mahiru and Chitose. And sure, Chitose was cute, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane found her more annoying than anything else, and there was no need for him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to praise her to her face anyway. So who else would he even talk to like that?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could see that Mahiru was feeling defensive. He watched her reactions carefully<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as he continued. "Besides, you must be used to people saying those kinds of things<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about you, right?" He shrugged. "Why should it bother you now?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After all, he had told Mahiru many times that he thought she was cute. It didn't seem<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like the kind of thing that would suddenly become a sticking point. She knew how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    beautiful she was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She can't be that embarrassed just because of a little compliment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That's what Amane thought, but for some reason, Mahiru was still wearing a sour face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Seriously, what's the matter?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She landed one final attack by whacking him again with the cushion, then Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turned away sharply and said "I'm going to go make mochi soup" before putting on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her apron and heading for the kitchen.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't do anything but squeeze the cushion and stare at Mahiru's back as she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    abruptly stalked out of the room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    By the time they finished eating the mochi soup, Mahiru was back to her usual self.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The start of the meal had been rather uncomfortable, but both the soup and the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    assorted osechi dishes were so delicious that Amane had quickly forgotten everything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    else, and before he realized it, Mahiru's spirits had recovered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As they moved from the table back to sitting together on the sofa, Amane asked, "By<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the way, are you planning to go for a shrine visit to start off the New Year, Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shrine visit? I wasn't really planning to go… I don't like crowds, you know. People<p></p>
    <p></p>
    always stare at me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's because you're…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had been about to say "…because you're so beautiful," but the mood had only just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    recovered after his earlier faux pas, so he swallowed the words and only said "Well, I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    guess there's not a ton you can do about that" instead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you going to go to one, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I always went with my parents when I was back home, but I was just wondering<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whether I should go. I was thinking that it might be best to pass, at least on New Year's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Day."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Agreed."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Chitose and Itsuki are having a cozy time at her place, so they're not around, and kids<p></p>
    <p></p>
    these days don't make a big deal out of the first shrine visit of the year anyway, you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    know? I think we can put it off."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Compared to the old days… for young people, especially those in their teens and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    twenties, first-day-of-the-year shrine visits were getting less and less popular. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and Mahiru wouldn't be especially strange for skipping out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't exactly that he didn't want to go, but he knew that there would be too many<p></p>
    <p></p>
    people to be able to move comfortably and that the experience would just end up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    being exhausting, so he was thinking it would probably be better to go after the crowds<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thinned out a bit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Besides," Amane continued, "I want to spend the first three days of the New Year<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relaxing. I don't really care about holiday bargains or anything, either."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Actually, I am sort of interested in the special blind bags some stores have," Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mentioned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you going to a shopping mall or somewhere?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She shook her head. "…I'm not brave enough to charge into those crowds."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Agreed."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane replied in the same way Mahiru had a moment ago and leaned back into the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sofa.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was definitely no need to go anywhere just because it was New Year's Day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was perfectly content taking it easy at home. He preferred to avoid stressful<p></p>
    <p></p>
    situations, after all. And since they'd be spending the holiday together, he certainly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wouldn't want for food or conversation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thinking to himself what a luxurious New Year's holiday this was turning out to be,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane stole a glance at Mahiru sitting beside him as a small smile crept onto his face.<p></p>

    18 : Visiting Parents and the First Shrine Visit of the Year<p></p>
    e stole a glance at Mahiru sitting beside him as a small smile crept onto his face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Can we visit your apartment tomorrow, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's father, Shuuto, sent that message at ten o'clock in the evening on January 3—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    after dinner and after Mahiru had gone home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's all right that you didn't come home for the holiday, but I do want to see you. Besides,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I heard about her from your mother, but I think I'd better say hello to your neighbor<p></p>
    <p></p>
    myself."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His father probably wanted to meet the person taking such good care of his son. And<p></p>
    <p></p>
    since Amane's mother had already discovered his relationship with Mahiru, and was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    actually in regular contact with her, Amane didn't see much point in refusing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He no longer had anything to hide, and he didn't want to turn his parents away after<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not visiting for the holidays. Plus, Amane figured that the presence of his father should<p></p>
    <p></p>
    help keep his mother in check and prevent her from making a big scene. If nothing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    else, Amane was counting on him to help him avoid a repeat of her last exhausting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    visit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Besides, Amane had a feeling that even if he did refuse his parents, his mother would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    come over to see Mahiru anyway, so after setting up a time with his father (who had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been courteous enough to ask in advance) Amane sent Mahiru a heads-up message.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um, well, is it all right for me to be there during your family time? Won't I be intruding?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The next day, Mahiru came over to Amane's apartment early. She seemed nervous.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was only to be expected, in a way. Mahiru had been taking care of him… though<p></p>
    <p></p>
    phrasing it that way sounded a bit misleading… In any case, Mahiru had been spending<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a lot of time with him, and now his parents wanted to meet her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was already used to talking with his mother, or at least being talked at by his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mother, but Amane's father would be joining this time. It was no surprise that she was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nervous.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, now that Dad is coming to say hello, and since Mom has taken such a liking to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you, I'd appreciate it if you were here. Really, I need you here."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-you say that, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm sure you would rather avoid it, but it'd really mean a lot to me if you'd put up with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it just for a little while."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was somewhat surreal to be introducing her to his parents, but they'd requested,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and now there was no way around it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He felt bad for taking up Mahiru's time, but he knew that his father was the type of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    person who likely wouldn't rest until he'd met her, so he hoped she wouldn't mind it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too much.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I wonder what Shihoko has told him about me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Relax. I made sure to tell my dad that you are someone who helps me out a lot. Even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    if he gets the wrong idea, I've already told him that my mother's crazy ideas about you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    are not at all true."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's mother seemed to have already decided that Mahiru was his bride-to-be and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her very own future daughter-in-law. Amane had made sure to firmly deny everything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    coming out of her mouth. His father had laughed and said, "Shihoko has always had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the bad habit of letting her imagination run wild." So apparently, he understood the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    situation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed relieved to hear that, and Amane smiled wryly as they waited. "Sorry<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about this."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Then, with perfect timing, the intercom rang.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His parents had already gotten past the lobby with their duplicate key, so he expected<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that they had come directly to his door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At the sound of the chime, Mahiru shuddered in surprise, so Amane shot her a small<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smile to put her at ease and headed for the door. He took the chain off and unfastened<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the lock.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he opened the door, there stood his parents, just as he remembered them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's been half a year, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Long time no see, Dad."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane greeted Shuuto's amicable smile with a slightly relieved grin of his own.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With his gentle demeanor, Shuuto was the type of person who somehow calmed things<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down just by being around. Amane relaxed a little simply seeing him there.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You didn't seem nearly as happy to see your mother…," Shihoko said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's because my mother forced her way in without so much as a warning. If you'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ever give me any notice, I would react normally."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The last time Shihoko had shown up, Mahiru had been at his place, and he'd tried to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turn her away. If he'd been alone, he probably would have treated her a little nicer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well anyway, come on in," Amane added. "What's with the package?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, we brought you all sorts of things. But we can look at that later. Where's Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Inside," Amane answered succinctly. After his parents had removed their shoes, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    led them into the living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed anxious as she looked over at them and blinked, wide-eyed, in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    understandable surprise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's father looked remarkably young. He didn't seem to be much past thirty,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    especially if you forgot that he had a teenage son, and had a youthful, handsome face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    More than once, Amane had wished that he took more after his father, whose tender<p></p>
    <p></p>
    features made him seem like a well-mannered young man (though in actuality, he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    middle-aged). When the two of them walked side by side, they looked more like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    distant brothers than father and son.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru dear, it's been too long," Shihoko said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "'Too long'? It's only been a month!" Amane remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I think that counts." Shihoko approached Mahiru wearing a beaming smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru stood straighter and greeted her with a formal "How good to see you again,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wearing the faint smile that was an integral part of her public persona.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But her bewildered eyes were still straying toward Amane's father, standing next to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko. Shuuto smiled warmly when he noticed Mahiru looking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nice to meet you. I'm Amane's father, Shuuto Fujimiya. I've heard about you from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko, Miss Shiina. Thank you for taking such good care of our son."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nice to meet you. I'm Mahiru Shiina. And I appreciate everything Amane does for me<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as well."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shuuto bowed politely, and Mahiru introduced herself courteously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had probably been worried that Amane's father would be a lot like his mother,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but Shuuto was a mild-mannered man with a good head on his shoulders, and he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doing his best to put Mahiru at ease.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shuuto was generally the one who reined in Shihoko's wilder tendencies. Really, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was the only person she would listen to, which proved just how much she loved him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Goodness, you don't have to be so modest!" Shihoko interrupted. "Amane is a slob,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    after all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Geez, sorry I don't meet your standards…," Amane muttered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come now, Shihoko, don't say things like that," his father said. "…And, Amane, this girl<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is taking care of you day in, day out, so I'm sure you're showing her the appropriate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gratitude and appreciation, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "As best I can."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's what I like to hear."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shuuto, who had raised Amane to treasure women, had apparently been worried over<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whether his son was being considerate enough. Of course Amane would have found it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unbearable to kick back while Mahiru did everything, so he did whatever he could for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shuuto seemed reassured by Amane's answer and turned his gaze toward Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Truly, I must offer you my thanks. I hear you've been fixing my son's meals every<p></p>
    <p></p>
    day, and you were even kind enough to make osechi dishes for the holiday…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm always thanking her for that. I've been trying to show my appreciation every<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chance I get, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's true…" Mahiru nodded. "Amane's surprisingly considerate."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Surprisingly?" Amane asked. "And what's so surprising about it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Th-that is, I—I mean…," Mahiru stammered. "You seemed… a bit neglectful at first<p></p>
    <p></p>
    glance, but it turns out you actually pay rather close attention."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane found himself at a loss for words, unable to refute anything she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The most important thing is that the two of you are getting along well," Shuuto said<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with a gentle smile. "Amane, make sure you're not being too much of a bother to Miss<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shiina."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I know that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And, Miss Shiina, I'd like you to speak up right away if Amane gives you any trouble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    My son might not seem like it, but he's really quite an earnest young man, so I believe<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he'll do his best to smooth over any… rough patches."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane is a nice guy. I can't think of anything rough about him… well, maybe just a tiny<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bit…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "He's not exactly the smoothest, eh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No… he's not really disagreeable… more like, he's just a little hopeless."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was fidgeting as if she was having a hard time saying what was on her mind. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    made Amane want to cross-examine her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What exactly is so hopeless that you had to say it like that?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For some reason that Amane didn't understand, Shihoko seemed to grasp what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru getting at. She looked over at him with a broad grin. "Ah-haah!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't do much more than glare at his mother in irritation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here you are."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's parents were guests in his apartment, so it was only natural to treat them as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    such. However, Mahiru had insisted on being the one to set out the tea, so Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    left it in her capable hands.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had brought her tea set over to his apartment so she could use it whenever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she visited. Amane had never imagined it would be used for this, though.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Both of his parents were wearing warm smiles, seated on the sofa where Amane and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru usually sat together.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My goodness, thank you, Mahiru dear. You're quite skilled at hosting visitors, aren't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Though, really, that should be Amane's job, you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was doing it because when Amane tried brewing tea, it usually turned out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much too bitter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Still, Shihoko looked somewhat aghast.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I wanted to do it, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I suppose that's fine, since Amane never gets the water temperature right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother was absolutely correct, but it made him a little irritated that she pointed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it out so blatantly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, he couldn't deny the truth, so he stoically kept his mouth shut as Shihoko<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turned to him and smiled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come to think of it, Amane, you've finally started calling sweetie Mahiru by her first<p></p>
    <p></p>
    name, haven't you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At this sudden observation, both Amane and Mahiru froze.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They had grown so comfortable talking to each other that they hadn't noticed, but last<p></p>
    <p></p>
    time they had seen Amane's mother, the two of them had still been addressing each<p></p>
    <p></p>
    other quite formally.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What's it matter?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I think it's great!" His mother beamed. "It's nice that you're getting more intimate."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without pressing the issue any further, Shihoko just sat and beamed at them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could feel his cheek begin to twitch. He almost wished she would just make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fun of him. It would have been easier than dealing with his mother's wild assumptions<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and fabricated narratives.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shihoko dear, don't tease Amane so much," Amane's father interjected. "It's a bad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    habit of yours," he added.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, honey. You know I just can't help myself." Amane's mother capitulated to his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    father without much resistance, a fact for which their long-suffering son was acutely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grateful. "But it's wonderful, isn't it? To see our son getting on so well with a cute girl?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm more concerned about whether you might get carried away again, Shihoko darling."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "When that happens, you'll step in for me, won't you, Shuuto darling?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "On some level, I wish you'd work on it if you're already aware it's an issue… but that's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    also part of what makes you the woman I fell in love with, so I suppose there's no<p></p>
    <p></p>
    helping it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ho-ho… what a sly fox you are."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though he was glad Shihoko had eased up on him, Amane couldn't help but sigh<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as his parents drifted off into their own little world.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His father was fundamentally a sensible man, but he had the unfortunate habit of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doting on his treasured wife, which sometimes made it a little awkward for anyone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    else stuck in the same room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Fortunately, they only did this in front of family and didn't act so embarrassingly in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    public. On the other hand, this was supposed to be Amane's apartment, and he wished<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they would show a little more restraint. He was glad that his parents still had a strong<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relationship after so many years together, but they could have been more considerate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about their public displays of affection.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whenever they got like this, Amane didn't like to force himself in between them, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    simply sat down in the chair he had brought over from the dining room and sighed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    deeply again in resignation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru also took a seat in the chair he had set up next to his, and asked Amane quietly,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Your parents get along very well, don't they?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure do. I mean, they're not like that outside, but that's definitely how they are at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    home."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I see," Mahiru answered with a peculiar smile, then looked over at Shihoko and Shuuto.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She didn't seem uncomfortable at all—just the opposite, in fact. Mahiru looked like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was staring at something dazzling and priceless. Amane thought he saw a touch<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of envy in her gaze as she smiled so faintly that the word fleeting didn't do it justice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without thinking, Amane extended a hand toward hers—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, Amane, what is it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He immediately withdrew his hand as the sound of Shihoko's voice pulled him back to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his senses.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't ask me. You and Dad went off into your own world. The two of us could barely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stand to look at you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, are you jealous?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not a chance. I was just thinking that you should get a room. In the privacy of your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    own home, preferably."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother didn't seem to have noticed that he had been on the verge of grabbing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's hand. Mahiru also seemed not to have noticed and forced a smile at Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    words.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He didn't understand why he had instinctually reached out toward her. For some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reason… he had felt like he couldn't bear the thought of leaving Mahiru all alone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was already back to her usual self, so Amane felt slightly relieved and put on his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    usual surly expression so that no one would be any the wiser.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So are you satisfied now, having seen your son's face?" Amane demanded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm more satisfied seeing sweet Mahiru than you, Amane…" His mother leered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm only joking. We still haven't accomplished our real mission yet, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your real what now…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had assumed that they had come over to simply exchange New Year's greetings<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and meet Mahiru, but his mother seemed to have some other goal in mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You and Mahiru haven't been on your first shrine visit of the year yet, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We were planning to go after the crowds die down."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I knew it! And you haven't been yet, either, right, Mahiru? I asked in my message."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Right." Mahiru nodded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I thought that would be the case, so we brought kimonos!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, his mother wanted to go on a shrine visit with Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko was wearing a wide grin as Amane finally realized the reason why she had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brought such a large bag with her. He sighed again. He'd lost count of how many times<p></p>
    <p></p>
    today.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko loved cute things, and she loved playing dress-up, so she'd probably been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    waiting for a chance like this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane also recalled that his mother had a large number of kimonos at home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, she had brought some with her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I've always dreamed of putting a kimono on a daughter and going on a shrine visit<p></p>
    <p></p>
    together… Oh, I'm sure this one will suit you, Mahiru."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mom, you just want a dress-up doll."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not true! But I really do want to dress up Mahiru. Look, this one would suit her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so well!" Shihoko was full of confidence, and her opinion was correct, insofar as there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were hardly any clothes that wouldn't suit Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had seen her in everything from boyish outfits to fancy getups on top of her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    usual girly outfits that featured plenty of frills and lace. As far as he could remember,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    each and every style seemed to suit Mahiru just fine. Apparently, beautiful people<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't need to be choosy about what they wore. It was not hard to imagine that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    traditional Japanese clothes would really suit her as well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was an only child, so his mother was obviously not going to pass up this chance<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to dress up the daughter of her dreams.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, if Mahiru says it's all right, how about you dress her up and go?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why are you talking like you're not coming, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can't; it'll be trouble if I go out with Mahiru and people from school see us together."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If it was only his parents and Mahiru, they would just look like any other family going<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on a shrine visit, so it wouldn't rouse any suspicions, but if Amane joined them, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone from their class spotted him at the shrine with Mahiru, well, he imagined<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that the start of the winter semester would turn into something out of a nightmare.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No shrine visit was worth that risk.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So it'll be all right as long as no one finds out?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I suppose, but I'm pretty sure it'd be really… Uh, wait. I don't like where this is going,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mom…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Heh-heh! I came prepared for situations just like this!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What situations?!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had thought that she'd brought an awful lot of luggage for only kimonos and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    underclothes and accessories. Apparently, she had brought even more stuff so she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could play dress-up with Amane as well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your father is also very excited, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Dad…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We don't get to go out together very often," Amane's father said, "and it is our family's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tradition, after all, so I'd like us to all go together."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he put it that way, it was difficult to refuse.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's father cared a great deal about family traditions. He would feel bad for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    refusing to go along after both his parents made it clear how much they wanted it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But look—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine, dear. You just let your mother take care of it. I'll make you look like a stylish<p></p>
    <p></p>
    young man. I promise you won't even resemble the old Amane!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Isn't that basically the same as saying I'm not stylish now?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course, you've got good features because you take after your father, but your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    haircut and clothes are so unfashionable. I'd say you look gloomy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I didn't ask."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was painfully aware of his drab appearance, but he looked like this because he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    liked to, so he didn't appreciate the criticism.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You'd think that someone so handsome would have an easy time looking cool, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you're a troublesome case, Amane…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's none of your business."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's such a waste… right, Mahiru dear? Wouldn't you like to see Amane all tidied up?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As the conversation suddenly shifted to her, Mahiru became visibly flustered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wished that his mother wouldn't prod at Mahiru so aggressively, but she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    continued needling the poor girl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Once Amane is all dressed up, I think you'll see him in a whole new light, too, Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He may not look it, but Amane's got a fairly handsome face, you know? Personalitywise, he's got some work to do, but he does resemble Shuuto, and he knows how to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a gentleman, so if you train him well, I think he could turn out quite nice."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, um… I… suppose so…?" Mahiru stammered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And don't you want to go on the first shrine visit of the year together?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "W-well I… um… I do want to go, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, how could you double-cross me like that?" Amane whined.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd been counting on her to consider what might happen in the worst-case scenario<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and reject his parents' proposal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru glanced at the beleaguered Amane. "…If Amane doesn't want to, it's fine," she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    said in a quiet, slightly discouraged voice, frowning.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane choked. She was trying to hide it, but he could tell that Mahiru was disappointed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't anything dramatic; just a subtle change in her expression. Looking at her long<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eyelashes fluttering over her downcast eyes, Amane felt a powerful knot of guilt<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tighten in his chest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother shot him a look of condemnation, as if to say You made sweet Mahiru sad!<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and his father wore an expression that said It would be easier to fold here.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane groaned quietly and simply said, "…All right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Mahiru made a face like that, there was nothing to do but give in.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay, you're all set."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko had been tinkering wildly with Amane's hair and clothes, until he was quite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exhausted by the time he was finally set free.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It had been pure agony for him, who wasn't much interested in clothes, but when he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    checked himself in the mirror, he could see that his suffering had been worth it. Staring<p></p>
    <p></p>
    back at him was a handsome young man, completely unlike the usual Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The outfit Shihoko had chosen for him was a dark-gray Chesterfield coat over a white<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turtleneck, paired with black slacks—clean and casual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since this was supposed to be an auspicious New Year's event, she had apparently<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought it was critical that he dress up a little. Amane usually didn't like especially<p></p>
    <p></p>
    colorful clothing, so this subdued, monochrome arrangement pleased him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He checked his hairstyle, too, and saw that his mother's skill with a flat iron and some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    styling wax had really worked wonders with his long bangs. His eyes had emerged<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from their usual hiding spot behind his hair, and the impression he gave off was much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brighter now that you could actually see his whole face. The extra volume in his hair<p></p>
    <p></p>
    plus the excellent styling made him look more dignified and refined as well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The person in the mirror wasn't the Amane who got teased by his mother and Itsuki<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for being gloomy, but a bright young man who Amane had never seen before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can turn into such a good-looking young man with just a little work, so I wonder<p></p>
    <p></p>
    why you don't do it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Because I don't want to."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can really be such a grouch sometimes. Your face is usually dour, so unless you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smile, you won't look good, you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Being called dour stung, but Amane couldn't argue with the facts.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, I'm going to go put the finishing touches on Mahiru, so you go wait in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    living room."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had been busy in his room, so he didn't have any idea how Mahiru was getting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on. She had gone back to her apartment to dress herself, presumably to quite a high<p></p>
    <p></p>
    standard.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He watched his mother leave the room, then looked himself over in the mirror again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hadn't gotten dressed up like this in a long time, so he didn't resemble himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, I guess it's not bad."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was sure he'd still look shabby standing next to Mahiru, but this was a big<p></p>
    <p></p>
    improvement.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Playing with his bangs a little, now that they weren't hanging in front of his eyes,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane muttered under his breath that sprucing himself up like this from time to time<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably wouldn't be a bad thing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After waiting in the living room with his father for the better part of an hour, Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heard the front door open.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had heard that women's preparations could take quite a lot of time and effort, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he hadn't been particularly unhappy with the wait itself, but he was still a bit worried<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about leaving Mahiru alone and whether his mother might have crossed any lines.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Finally, thought Amane as he stood up from the sofa and looked toward the entryway,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just as Mahiru quietly arrived in the living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The moment he laid eyes on her, he was stunned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't normally wear traditional Japanese clothing, so he had never had the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chance to see her in it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had thought for sure that a kimono would look good on her, but—he hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expected this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    According to his mother, it would be difficult to move through a crowd in a longsleeved kimono, so she had chosen something shorter. With its light-pink color and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    small, repeating pattern of plum blossoms, the kimono suited Mahiru so well that it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was hard to believe it didn't actually belong to her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't normally wear much pink, but it gave her an air of refinement and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    femininity.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her light-colored hair had been left out in long bangs on the sides, and the rest had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been gathered into a bun and decorated with a kanzashi hair clip. Swaying across the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pure-white nape of her neck, the accessory accentuated the girlishness of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ensemble and gave her a distinctly feminine allure.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The elegant outfit, coupled with makeup that had been judiciously applied to enhance<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her natural good looks, elevated Mahiru to the pinnacle of grace and beauty.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So?" Amane's mother beamed. "I think we made her look very cute. Sweet Mahiru is<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so lovely to begin with, and dolling her up really had quite the effect."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, it certainly suits her, dear," his father quickly agreed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had her eyes cast downward, looking rather embarrassed by all the praise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even that movement had something alluring about it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Beauty can really be terrifying.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, Amane, say something."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I think it looks good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was obviously no way he could possibly say what he really thought, especially<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not right there in front of his parents, so Amane kept his praise safely subdued.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother looked extremely dissatisfied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…That won't do at all!" she insisted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, be quiet." Amane turned away. He was not going to engage with his mother any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko gave an exasperated sigh at her son's behavior, but perhaps because she knew<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him quite well, she seemed to agree to let it go.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good grief. Anyway, Mahiru darling, what do you think? Amane looks like a whole<p></p>
    <p></p>
    new person, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yes. This is completely different…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And to think even though he would be so popular if he put in the effort to look like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this all the time, he doesn't ever bother. Really, he's only harming himself."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought this was none of her business, but his mother sighed heavily again, as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    if she truly regretted the loss of potential.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm so disappointed in Amane—he has the good fortune to take after his father, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    yet he doesn't even try to put it to good use. What a waste!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come now, Shihoko," his father said gently. "Amane's growing up in his own way."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If he's growing up, then shouldn't he want to be popular?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If I had to guess, I'd say Amane is the type who is perfectly fine spending time with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just one other person rather than bothering with a crowd."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I guess."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's father had tried to stall Shihoko, but that only fueled her wildest delusions.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was true Amane preferred to hang out one-on-one rather than tag along in a big<p></p>
    <p></p>
    group… Apparently, that was something he had gotten from his father, and he really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    did think it was best, but if he said as much, especially now, it would sound like he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    saying the person he preferred most was Mahiru…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother's radiant smile turned into a grimace, and she turned away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wondered why he had to put up with her unfair cynicism, but as a practical<p></p>
    <p></p>
    matter, he was well aware that other people looked at him the same way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At the very least, Amane could say that Mahiru was a special case. That was the truth,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    but—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He snuck a glance at Mahiru, quickly, so she wouldn't notice, and sighed softly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I guess I do like her, in a sense, he thought. I mean, what's not to like about her?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, that was quite a different matter than declaring feelings of love.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mom, there is absolutely nothing going on, I'm telling you. So how about you stop it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with the crazy accusations and go get the car ready."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What an ungrateful child you are… really! Well, all right, I suppose. Shuuto, let's go<p></p>
    <p></p>
    prepare the car, shall we?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sounds like a plan."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had apparently succeeded in changing the subject, as both parents left to make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ready for their departure.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was leaving it up to his parents to decide which shrine they were going to, and he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    watched their backs as they left his apartment to head for the parking lot.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I've got the essentials in my bag, so I don't need much getting ready. How about you,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Everything I need is in this handbag, so I'm ready, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Gotcha."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They were suddenly alone again, so with a slightly anxious feeling, Amane locked up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the windows and unplugged nonessential appliances from the walls.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once he had turned off the living room lights, he looked at Mahiru again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As always, it was immediately apparent she was a beauty. He doubted whether there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was another girl in the world who looked as good in a kimono.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hadn't been comfortable praising her in front of his parents, but Amane was sure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that anyone who saw her would agree that Mahiru was particularly beautiful in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    traditional Japanese dress.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is something the matter, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, no, I was just thinking it really suits you. You look like an old-fashioned beauty<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from a painting or something. The outfit's cute, and I think you're really lovely."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had learned from his father that when a girl was smartly dressed, compliments<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were in order, so he knew he should have praised her look the moment he saw her, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had been too embarrassed to do it in front of his parents.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once Amane had voiced his honest appraisal, Mahiru dramatically blinked several<p></p>
    <p></p>
    times, then blushed and pursed her lips tightly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recalling the last time she had reacted like that, Amane smiled bitterly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, you don't like being complimented, right? Sorry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Th-that's not it, but… Amane, you're fairly—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fairly what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She abruptly turned away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wondered what was going on with her, but she didn't look like she was going<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to elaborate, so Amane quietly finished closing up the apartment and accompanied<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru to the door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She seemed to have given some thought to the fact that they'd be walking around,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because she was wearing boots instead of the traditional sandals. Her choice of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    footwear blended Japanese and western elements in her outfit, and she looked all the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more adorable for it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru somehow wiggled into her boots, as her hair accessory swung back and forth<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with a rustling sound, and Amane, who had gone out first to hold the door, found<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself suddenly quite close to her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru caught him by surprise when she stood up on her tiptoes and gingerly leaned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even closer to him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thinking that maybe she wanted to tell him something, Amane shut the door and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    locked it, then bent over to lend her his ear. Mahiru cupped her palms around her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mouth and whispered into his ear.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Um… You look good, too, you know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was all she said before slipping past him and briskly heading for the elevator.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane promptly banged his head against his front door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…That's not fair."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's heart was pounding like an alarm going off in his chest, his face was burning,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and his forehead hurt. Mahiru had set him ablaze in a single breath. This was her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    revenge.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His parents looked at him suspiciously as he hustled to catch up to them in the parking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lot.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When they arrived at a famous shrine located in an area a little less than an hour away,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there weren't as many people as they had seen on television, but the crowds still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed practically endless.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it's thinned out quite a bit, but I'd say there are still plenty here, eh?" Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mother remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There sure are…," Amane agreed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru darling, careful not to stray. We'll keep an eye on you, too, and we all have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smartphones, so I think finding one another would be easy enough. But even so, I want<p></p>
    <p></p>
    us all to visit the shrine together, of course."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Dressed in a kimono, Mahiru had the hardest time moving out of all of them. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    restrictive garment forced her to take small steps and walk slowly. At least she was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wearing boots instead of sandals.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They didn't necessarily have to push their way through the crowd, but it was tight<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough that it was easy to run into people, so they had to proceed with caution.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, shall we get going?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko was leading the way through the crowd, and she headed first for the ablution<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pavilion where they would purify their hands and mouths with water. As expected,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was already attracting attention from many people.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    More than a few people were dressed in kimonos, so Mahiru didn't stand out much for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wearing one… but that wasn't the issue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She drew people's eyes even in her school uniform, when she wasn't dressed up at all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now that she looked like an aristocratic beauty in traditional Japanese clothing, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    obviously garnered a lot of attention. Even her motions as she cleaned her mouth were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    graceful. Practically everyone in the shrine was staring.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Is something the matter?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though Amane was thinking it was all rather interesting, he didn't say as much, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he cleansed his hands and mouth just as his parents had, then followed after them as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they walked on ahead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was doing his best to match pace with Mahiru, but as expected for someone who<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't ordinarily wear Japanese clothes, the long hem was giving her some difficulty,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and the shrine was still quite crowded, so she was progressing much more slowly than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    usual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, are you all right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, this is… Aaah!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was getting bumped around by the other shrine-goers, which kept knocking her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    off-balance and threatened to topple her outright, so Amane extended an arm to assist.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't seem to be all right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course she was uncomfortable walking around in a strange and complicated getup.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Sorry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here, give me your hand."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane reached for one small hand that was peeking out of her kimono sleeve. Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked up at him, and he nearly pulled his hand back, but she quickly pressed her palm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into his, keeping her eyes on him the whole time. He stared right back at her, though<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was not entirely sure why.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru squeezed Amane's hand tightly and looked away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He tilted his head questioningly, and they followed the flow of the crowd for a moment,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    until they were about to arrive in front of the offertory box, so Amane tucked whatever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    small doubts he had away in his heart and focused on the sensation of her hand in his.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You were praying for a really long time; what did you ask for?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Once they had finished their visit and moved a distance away from the file of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    worshippers, he posed this question to Mahiru, who had prayed at some length. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had looked like a model going through all the motions of a shrine visit. After ringing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the bell, she had pressed her hands together for nearly twice as long as Amane. He had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been captivated by how elegantly she had offered her prayers, but he also wondered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    what she had to pray for.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good health."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "An incredibly safe choice."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was very typical of Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She didn't want for very much, so Amane had wondered what she might have asked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for, but it was so predictable choice that her answer was kind of anticlimactic.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That, and—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…And to be able to keep spending peaceful days together, just like we have been."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Another very typical petition.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was just the sort of thing that Mahiru, who didn't much care for excitement or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    change, would pray for. It was very fitting, as she prized peace and quiet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We won't get much of that while my mom's around, though."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's something we can enjoy for what it is."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Is it, though…?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't sure, but Mahiru seemed to be enjoying herself, so he didn't argue and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just took Mahiru's hand with a gentle smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They hadn't yet entirely extracted themselves from the crowd, and Amane was sure to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    find himself in trouble if he let Mahiru trip and fall now. He could see his parents<p></p>
    <p></p>
    waiting a short distance away, having already finished their own visit to the shrine.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was why Amane was holding her hand, he told himself. Mahiru's eyelashes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fluttered, and she kept her eyes cast downward, looking embarrassed, but she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    squeezed Amane's hand back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You two, over here!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother's voice was bright and clear, easy to distinguish among the crowd.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Following her words, the two of them headed over to Amane's parents. Shihoko's eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    went wide when she saw them, then she pressed a hand over her smiling mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh my, my!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're just holding hands so naturally."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't until she spelled it out that he realized what a mistake it was to hold Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hand in front of his mother. This was the kind of thing that couples did, wasn't it? He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't appreciate Shihoko's suspicions and hated always being on the receiving end of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her smirking grins.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's obviously so we don't lose sight of each other. Plus, it's easy for her to trip,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wearing a kimono."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "He's right. It's difficult to walk in a kimono, and he's doing the right thing by escorting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her. I do the same thing for you, Shihoko dear," Amane's father agreed. In a single<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smooth motion, he grasped his wife's hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's life would be easier if he were able to take a girl's hand as smoothly as his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    father could, but he knew it was impossible given his personality, so he was secretly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grateful that Mahiru had been frank about taking his hand instead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Feeling relieved that his mother's attention was occupied, Amane tried to gently let go<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of Mahiru's hand, but she wouldn't relax her grip.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He could tell from the way she squeezed that she had no intention of separating, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quietly asked her what was wrong, but there was no answer. Her delicate fingers<p></p>
    <p></p>
    simply held tightly to his.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, Mahiru sweetie, we were thinking of going to buy some hot drinks. Would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you like sweet red bean soup—or sweet sake?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, I'll take red bean soup, please."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother's interruption spoiled any hope of asking Mahiru further questions or of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    getting his hand back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How about you, Amane dear?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…All right, I'll have sweet sake."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Coming right up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As long as Mahiru doesn't hate this, I guess it's fine, right?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane tried to calm the fluttering in his chest as he adjusted his hand in hers.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Before long, Shihoko returned from the concessions stand and handed everyone their<p></p>
    <p></p>
    drinks. At this point, it would have been incredibly awkward for them to continue<p></p>
    <p></p>
    holding hands, so Mahiru let go, and Amane got the chance to catch his breath.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His parents were smiling at each other gently as they enjoyed their sweet sake.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They weren't quite off in their own world, but they were getting flirty, so Amane had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    no desire to speak to them at the moment and instead focused on drinking his own<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sweet sake.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sweet sake like this was said to be so nutritious it was like having an IV drip, and as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the rich sweetness of the fermented rice spread through him, he unintentionally let<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out a sigh that was a mix of astonishment and relief.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't usually care much for sweets, though he did rather like red bean paste,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so he had also been tempted to choose the red bean soup. However, he had gone with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the sake because it felt more appropriate for New Year's, and he was confident that it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had been the right choice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he glanced over at Mahiru, he saw her sipping her sweet red bean soup from a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    paper cup with a calm expression. She made it look absolutely delicious, and suddenly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he regretted his decision.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I wonder if I can get her to give me a sip?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was gazing at her and wondering if he could get some if he asked, when Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    noticed him looking and tilted her head quizzically. Her hair decoration swayed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rhythmically with her graceful movements.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is the sweet red bean soup any good?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's delicious," she said, nodding.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Could I try some?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked startled by his question. It was almost comical how quickly she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    straightened up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, s-sure you can, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She couldn't hide how flustered she was, glancing up at him timidly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you don't want me to, it's fine…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's… it's not that I don't want you to, but… well—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "N-no, nothing, it's fine. Here. Could I have some of your sake, too?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "S-sure."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru quickly seized his cup. She seemed suddenly very agitated for some reason.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane accepted her cup of red bean soup.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In it was a thick liquid that was certainly bean-colored.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he brought the cup to his lips, the unique fragrance of sweet red beans wafted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gently over him and filled his nose as a rich flavor spread over his tongue. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't have much of a sweet tooth, so even the slight sweetness of the bean soup<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed strong to him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was delicious and vividly brought to mind thoughts of how well sweet red bean<p></p>
    <p></p>
    paste paired with bitter green tea.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Mahiru seemed to have a thing for sweets, he thought this soup was probably<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just perfect for her tastes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he glanced over at Mahiru, perhaps because she had sipped the sweet sake, her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cheeks were slightly flushed. She looked almost anxious.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't like it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not it… Amane, you made such a big deal out of sharing a piece of cake. Why<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doesn't this bother you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Ah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was when he realized why Mahiru had reacted the way she did. Amane froze in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    We're not feeding each other, but I guess this is still an indirect kiss, huh?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His attention had been focused on the sweet red bean soup, and he had inadvertently<p></p>
    <p></p>
    suggested that they share an indirect kiss. He may not have realized it, but there could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be no doubt that he had put Mahiru on the spot. That must have been why she had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    acted the way she had.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "S-sorry. That was really thoughtless. I'm sure you hated it…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wh-why are you always like that, Amane? I was just… I was embarrassed, okay? That<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I— I'll be more careful in the future. Sorry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whatever she might have been feeling, it was a fact that he had put her on the spot.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane bowed his head slightly, and Mahiru waved her hand in front of her face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    frantically.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "R-really, I'm not worried about it!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you sure? Well, I'm sorry anyway. I shouldn't treat you the same way as my other<p></p>
    <p></p>
    friends."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki and Chitose were the type of people who didn't care about that stuff and would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    take sips of Amane's drinks and bites of his food and insist it was fine because they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were friends.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki was the same sex as Amane, and Chitose was the opposite sex, but he had never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked at either of them with the slightest romantic interest, so it didn't really feel like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an indirect kiss when they shared food. He just got irritated when they stole his snacks.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But with Mahiru, it was obviously different. He was in the wrong for not realizing that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sooner.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do Itsuki and Chitose usually do things like that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yeah, I mean, we're friends, after all…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is that so?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru nodded, wearing a complex expression that could have been either<p></p>
    <p></p>
    comprehension or consternation. Then she lowered her gaze back down to the sweet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sake and raised the cup to her lips again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I suppose, Amane, that you and I are friends, too, so it's fine."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yeah… but you drank it all, didn't you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's cheeks flushed even though there was no alcohol in the drink. "Th-there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't much left!" She turned away sharply.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In retaliation, Amane gulped down what was left of Mahiru's sweet red bean soup.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd expected it to have gotten cold, but it was somehow still hot and seemed even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sweeter than before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru dear, you're such a good cook!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    By the time they made it back from the shrine visit, it was already evening. Mahiru had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    changed clothes and begun her usual dinner preparations, but… Amane's mother<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko was also in the kitchen, ostensibly to observe Mahiru's culinary skills.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His parents had decided to spend the night. Their house was several hours away by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    car, and they were tired. It sounded like they had been intending to stay over from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    outset. Amane wished that they'd asked the guy living there first, but his father<p></p>
    <p></p>
    technically owned the apartment, so he knew he had no right to complain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Luckily, he had an extra futon set just in case he ever had anyone over, so he figured<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they could share it. They slept in the same bed at home, so it wouldn't be that different.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you very much," Mahiru said graciously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Really, you're very good for a high school girl. When I was your age, there's no way I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could have done all this."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your cooking's no match for Mahiru's now, Mom."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did you say something, dear?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not a thing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A low-pitched voice had come flying out of the kitchen at him, so Amane feigned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    innocence and huddled against the sofa. His father was relaxing on the couch next to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him and chided, "Now, Amane, don't pick on your mother."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But she was always picking on him, so he felt like this was a fair turnabout.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could hear his mother chatting with Mahiru in a cheerful voice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru calmly kept up with her, unfazed by her intense energy and attention. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed to be getting used to the high-strung woman.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Watching from afar, Amane gazed at the two of them preparing dinner and apparently<p></p>
    <p></p>
    getting along well, and he let out a quiet sigh of relief.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your mother seems to have taken quite a liking to Miss Shiina, hasn't she?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's father was gazing at the two of them in the same way, and he looked pleased.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, she's beautiful and sweet and has a nice personality, so I'm not surprised that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mom likes her."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How about you, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Oh, I mean, I think she's a nice person, and I think she's cute."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I see."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It seemed like a casual question, but Amane's father wasn't the type of person to pry<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too much, so he had probably asked out of genuine curiosity. He didn't press Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on his answer any further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm looking forward to trying this food that you enjoy every day, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can vouch for the taste. If Mom doesn't meddle too much, that is."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't need to worry. Shihoko was the one who wanted to eat Miss Shiina's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooking, so I'm sure the most she'll do is help out a little."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's good, if it's true."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother wasn't a bad cook, but most of her dishes featured big, bold flavors, in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    contrast to Mahiru's subtle seasonings. Delicate flavors were his father's specialty<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while his mother favored quantity and ease of preparation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, that was important for a housewife who had a growing boy's appetite to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    satisfy, but Amane actually preferred the carefully calibrated flavors of the dishes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru made. He shuddered to think of anyone meddling with Mahiru's exquisite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seasonings.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thankfully, his mother seemed to be constraining herself to being Mahiru's assistant<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like his father said, so he breathed a sigh of relief and continued watching the two of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    them cook.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh yes, this is very good," Amane's father said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way that the four of them would have fit around Amane's two-person<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dining table, so he had pulled out the large folding desk that had been shut away in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the storage room to use for dinner.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you very much." Mahiru looked relieved at Shuuto's frank assessment, and she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    visibly relaxed a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, she had never let anyone other than Amane eat her home cooking, outside<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of home-ec class in school, of course, and had been somewhat nervous about it… but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at last that stiffness melted away once she saw Shuuto's gentle smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's really delicious," Amane's mother added. "If she can cook like this, she won't have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    any trouble living alone—or getting married."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko muttered quietly to herself while looking at Amane. He could feel his cheek<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about to twitch but forcibly maintained a neutral expression and sipped his miso soup.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The rich, dashi-infused flavor was now very familiar to him. He had really gotten used<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to the way Mahiru prepared her dishes and, after eating her cooking every day, had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    practically lost all desire to eat anything else.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, what do you think?" his mother asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's delicious, of course. Thanks for always cooking, Mahiru."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had been planning to say as much anyway. But now that his mother had prompted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him, it probably sounded like he didn't really mean it. Amane had never forgotten to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tell Mahiru that her cooking was delicious every day when they ate together, but since<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his parents were here, he had been holding back. And that had obviously been the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wrong decision.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His gratitude was no different now, but for some reason, Mahiru was restless, fidgeting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    uncomfortably. "…Sure," she answered in a quiet voice. Her cheeks were flushed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slightly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was probably because his parents were there. There could be no doubt that Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was feeling bashful, even if only a little. She was used to hearing Amane's appraisals<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of her cooking, but now three people had complimented her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're awfully cute, Mahiru."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shihoko, don't tease."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not what I meant! I was just thinking that she's a good, upstanding girl, which<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is so hard to find these days."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Th-that's… It's not really…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I can agree with that. Mahiru's like, really pure, you could say."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane?!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was definitely a little naive. Her face had gone bright red once just from seeing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a guy—a not particularly attractive guy—with the front of his shirt open.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My, my, did something happen between you two while we weren't looking?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nope."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing happened."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The denial practically leaped from Mahiru's mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Being innocent or naive wasn't the worst thing in the world, but Mahiru seemed to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hate being called those things. Amane had no plans to say anything further.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I think that they should do just as they please, as long as Amane isn't hurting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Miss Shiina, that is," Amane's father said. "Just don't tease her too much, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know that much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, weren't you just teasing her?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, it was an accurate description—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt something strike his thigh below the table. Mahiru's face was bright red,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and she was glaring in his direction.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry, sorry," he said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A sullen expression crossed her handsome features. But that only made her look even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more adorable, and Amane couldn't help but grin. He only hoped that Mahiru wouldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stay mad at him for long.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You know, I can't help but feel a bit like we're looking in the mirror. What do you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    think, Shihoko darling?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I think that's just fine, Shuuto dear. Why, even our Amane is wearing an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    uncharacteristically gentle expression."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What are you guys talking about over there?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not a thing, dear!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could have sworn that he heard some low, conspiratorial whispers from across<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the table, but his parents maintained expressions of perfect innocence.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry you had to make enough for my parents, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After they had finished dinner and chatted pleasantly for another couple of hours, it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was finally time to break up the party.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, since Amane's parents would be sleeping in his living room, Mahiru was the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    only one going home.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had sent his parents to bathe, so he was the only one who stepped outside to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    see Mahiru off.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no need for him to do so, but he wanted the chance to apologize for his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mother and father, just in case.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, it's all right. This was fun."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It was?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was glad that she didn't appear upset.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If anything, she seemed like she had enjoyed herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Besides—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I got a small taste of happiness, so—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's thin voice was almost like a sigh. She smiled but also looked very lonely all<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of a sudden. It was a fleeting smile, one that seemed like it could be carried away by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the breeze. Amane was starting to piece together a picture of her situation at home, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he thought he recognized the faint look of yearning in her eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Somehow, he couldn't leave it alone, and Amane put his palm on her head and stroked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her hair.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked up at Amane in surprise, but she didn't seem to hate it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Wh-what are you doing?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not nothing… My hair's all messed up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're getting in the bath anyway, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I am, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Did you hate it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I—I didn't hate it, but… you could at least say something first."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Here we go."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's saying something after."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So it's okay to touch you as long as I tell you first? Amane thought, but he knew better<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than to say it out loud.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru let out a small sigh.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Geez… I'm fine with it, but it's really not appropriate to rub a girl's head so casually."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But I don't do it to anyone else…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane understood that the only time it was okay to touch a person of the opposite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sex was when you had a close relationship. He wasn't the kind of guy who would go<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around casually rubbing up against girls or anything. The closest he came to that was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smacking Chitose whenever she made a terrible joke.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had thought that maybe he and Mahiru had gotten close enough, so he had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tentatively touched her, hoping she wouldn't hate it, but the thought wouldn't have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even occurred to him if it was anyone else.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had fallen quiet, but she hadn't shaken off his hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm sure you can see it," she said, "but you're the spitting image of your father,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane. It's obvious to me, even though I've only known him a short while."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "In what sense? I really don't think I resemble him that much, either physically or with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    my personality."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're exactly like him. Truly."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru sighed more heavily this time, and Amane rubbed her head again. She still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't seem to be against it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …Do I really resemble him that much?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sure, they had once or twice been mistaken for brothers far apart in age, but Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    felt like he had a completely different energy from his father. Their personalities, too,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    while not exact opposites, nevertheless were quite different.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    What could she have meant by saying that he was just like his father, despite such clear<p></p>
    <p></p>
    differences?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Any number of doubts welled up in Amane's mind, but Mahiru must not have intended<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to say anything further. Her eyes narrowed a bit, and she left the matter alone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After stroking her hair a bit more, Amane pulled back, and Mahiru seemed to suddenly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    snap back to her senses. She peered up at Amane, slightly flustered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What, you wanted me to keep going?" he asked teasingly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru flushed red again. "Please don't mock me," she said quietly, so he decided to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    call it a day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, she was in a bad mood now, for she made no attempt to hide the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    displeasure on her face as she opened the door to her own apartment and slipped<p></p>
    <p></p>
    inside.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For a brief moment, Amane regretted his actions, wondering if he had overdone it a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    little, when Mahiru cracked her door open and peeked out at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her cheeks were still pink, and her voice sounded peevish but with a slight fawning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tone to it somehow.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You're a dummy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just as suddenly, Mahiru shut the door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …Well, that makes two of us, I guess.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Wasn't it Mahiru's fault that his heart was suddenly leaping in his chest?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sighed quietly, then leaned against the wall of the unheated corridor, trying to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    let the sudden burning in his chest cool a bit. That was the moment he noticed he could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    see his breath in the frosty air.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A short while after Amane had said goodnight to Mahiru and returned to his apartment,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his parents finished their bath. When Amane looked up from the TV toward the sound<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of approaching slippers, he saw them standing there in their nightclothes, casually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    holding hands.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Well, I guess that comes naturally if you've already taken a bath together.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "We've had our bath, Amane. It's your turn."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure… Wait, how did you two manage to both fit in my tub? It's only big enough for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For someone living alone, this was quite a spacious, well-designed apartment, but that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't mean the bathtub was especially large. It certainly wasn't big enough for a fullgrown man and woman to sit together comfortably.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh no, it's fine! There's no problem if you get in close together. Right, Shuuto dear?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother smiled and drew closer to her husband, and his father nodded in agreement<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with a gentle smile. They had already been married for nearly twenty years, but the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    two of them still acted like newlyweds. Amane could do nothing but smile bitterly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "As loving as always, I see."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you jealous?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not really. I can relax better in the bath alone anyway."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What about Mahiru…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, listen up. Nothing is going on with her."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He didn't understand why his mother wanted so badly to hook him up with Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Well, it wasn't a total mystery, since she'd been joking about wanting Mahiru for a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    daughter-in-law since the day they'd met, but Amane was certain his mother had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mistaken the trust that Mahiru had in Amane for romantic affection.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is that so?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now, now, Shihoko. Amane's at a delicate age, so let's be considerate."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But I'm being serious…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whatever you say, Mom."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane paid his mother's words no mind as he stood up to get ready for his bath, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he stopped when his father called his name.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane." He used a serious tone, not the voice he used to chide his wife or the one that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had when he smiled. When Amane looked at him, wondering what was the matter,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was met with a soft but firm gaze.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, are you glad you moved here?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though he was caught by surprise, after a moment Amane quickly met his father's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    steady gaze with an easy smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yeah, I am. Life got easier."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Surely his parents must have been worried about him. Worried enough to frequently<p></p>
    <p></p>
    come check on how he was doing and worried enough to try to see him at every<p></p>
    <p></p>
    opportunity.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    All of it had been in order to make sure that Amane was living comfortably.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is that so? I'm glad."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't need to worry; there's someone here who I can really rely on."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Unlike before—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He swallowed those words and kept his answer simple and clean.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother smiled brightly. "Oh, you must mean little Itsuki! I've never met him in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    person, so I wanted to go say hello, since we came all this way."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Give it a rest, please; you're going to start something weird."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not weird at all. I'll tell him how cute you were when you were little, and…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "See, that's exactly what I'm talking about. Seriously, just stop…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If this spilled over to Itsuki, then it was certain to reach Chitose as well. That was the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one thing Amane wanted to avoid no matter what. He did not want to deal with her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    endless teasing or put up with her badgering him for old photos from his past.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had looked remarkably like a cute little girl when he was small, and it didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    help that his mother sometimes even dressed him up in girls' clothes. If photographic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    evidence of that got out, his life would be nothing but suffering.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But I can't help wanting to say hello, can I? He's such good friends with you, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's true, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I bet he's a really good boy, isn't he? He's got the Amane seal of approval, after all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…He's a good guy. So good that he's wasted on me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It wasn't something he would ever say to Itsuki's face, but Amane always appreciated<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his friend who once took the initiative to call out in a friendly voice to a very gloomy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boy who never interacted with anyone and just sat quietly on the side of the classroom<p></p>
    <p></p>
    listening to music.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm going to take a bath."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He felt embarrassed after openly praising Itsuki, even though he wasn't there, and to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    disguise his discomfort, he quickly headed for his bedroom to retrieve a change of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clothes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He could hear a small chuckle behind his back, compelling Amane to escape to his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    room, scowling and muttering the whole way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The following morning, when Amane went out into the living room after waking up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and dressing, he found his parents already up and food on the table.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good morning. Breakfast is ready, so have a seat."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sat down at the table, smiling slightly at his father, who called to him from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kitchen, wearing Amane's apron, which had been draped over a chair.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had only just arrived in this apartment and had already made himself comfortable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in an unfamiliar kitchen, probably because he was so used to doing the cooking. At<p></p>
    <p></p>
    home, Amane's parents took turns preparing meals, so Amane was also used to seeing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his father in an apron, and there was nothing unusual about it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's mother was already waiting impatiently at the table. She probably wanted to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    help, but his father had likely insisted that she leave it to him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane also considered helping and got as far as standing up from his seat only to see<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his father bring out steaming hot rice and miso soup on a tray, immediately taking the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wind out of Amane's sails.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks, Dad."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't mention it. Anyway, Miss Shiina was kind enough to pack yesterday's leftovers<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into containers, so I just heated that up, cooked some rice, then made miso soup and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rolled omelets."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Eat a proper breakfast was practically a motto in the Fujimiya household, so they never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    skipped their morning meal.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's father had happily incorporated the leftovers into the menu, but if they hadn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had them, there was little doubt he would have whipped up something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    With a smile, Shuuto placed the rice and miso soup in front of each of them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's attention was drawn to his father's rolled omelets, which he hadn't tasted in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a while, and before he knew it, the table was set, and his father had taken his own seat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, let's get to it, shall we?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Certainly. Thank you, dear."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks for the meal."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Everyone expressed their gratitude, and then Amane reached with his chopsticks for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the rolled omelets in front of him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    This was the first time Amane had eaten his father's cooking since he went home for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    summer break, so he was looking forward to the nostalgia of it as he took his first bite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and slowly chewed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The flavor of the dashi, the hint of sweetness, the slightly undercooked egg—it tasted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like home—yet at the same time, Amane found something slightly lacking.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is something the matter?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His father seemed to have noticed Amane chewing with a serious expression and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sounded concerned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm… no, it's nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did I maybe mess up the seasonings?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "N-no, that's not it; it's good, but… I was just thinking that the flavor is different from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the way that Mahiru always makes omelets."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, so that's it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hadn't eaten his father's cooking for almost half a year, so even though it should<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have been familiar, he was actually more accustomed to Mahiru's cooking after eating<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it every day. Even Amane was surprised.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, that wasn't to say that his father's cooking was bad or anything, just that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's seasonings were more to Amane's tastes. But even so, he felt somewhat selfconscious about the fact that his tongue had adapted so well to Mahiru's cooking,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    when he had only met her a few months earlier.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You've really fallen for Miss Shiina, haven't you?" his father asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For her cooking, yeah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, now," his mother crowed. "Are you saying you're not interested in Mahiru herself,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    then?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No one is saying that, and I do not intend to fall for such a leading question."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was not about to let his mother steer the conversation in that direction again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Shihoko frowned—obviously, her aim had been exactly as Amane expected. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    snorted through his nose and refused to take the bait.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His parents departed before lunch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Both of them apparently had work the next day, so Amane had suggested that it would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be hard on them if they didn't get home early and rest. They had a long drive ahead of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    them, which would of course be exhausting, so it was better if they hurried up and got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    going.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But I wanted to talk more with my dear Mahiru and meet Itsuki…," his mother<p></p>
    <p></p>
    muttered quietly after stepping out the door into the building's hallway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Then do that stuff next time… Besides, you'll have to make an appointment to see<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki. He doesn't have a lot of free time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, you set it up for me then, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If I feel like it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was obvious to everyone that Amane had no intention of doing anything of the sort.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother grew sullen, but Amane's father soothed her—and more or less restored<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her good spirits.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane was watching his parents, the door to the next-door apartment quietly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    creaked open. From the narrow crack, he could see a flash of golden hair and Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    face peeking out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She must have come out because she had heard his mother talking. For better or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    worse, his mother's voice traveled quite well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, perfect, I was just thinking about coming to say good-bye!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Both of Amane's parents noticed Mahiru and moved over to stand in front of her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment as she slipped on a pair of shoes and stepped out into the hallway. Amane's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mother was wearing a big smile and seemed determined to get as close to Mahiru as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    possible. Mahiru shrunk back but didn't retreat entirely.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you two leaving already?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wish we weren't. Really, we'd like to stay another day or two, but we have work."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Things would be different if we had come up a little bit earlier, but… this is all the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    time we have."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru smiled placidly at Amane's parents.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, there's always next time," his mother said. "Although, next time it's Amane's turn<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to come to us."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, yeah. I'll be home for summer vacation."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could feel his mother's gaze bearing down on him. He knew right away she was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hoping that he would bring Mahiru along with him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Still, he couldn't help but wonder if that might be a good idea. She apparently spent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her school breaks alone, after all. Maybe she wouldn't be so opposed to the idea, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought idly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really have no charm at all, Amane," his mother said. "Isn't that right, Mahiru?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, I… I'm not sure how to—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come now, Shihoko, don't put her on the spot," Amane's father chided. "…Though, it's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    true that Amane has gotten less up front about various things as he's gotten older,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hasn't he?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had no allies here, so he silently pretended to ignore his parents. Shuuto<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turned to Mahiru with a gentle smile that was different than Shihoko's.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "As you can see, our Amane has a hard time expressing his feelings, but if you look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    closely, you can tell that he's a kindhearted young man. I would be very happy if you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would continue to be a good friend to him."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ugh, I'm right here, you know. This is so embarrassing…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His father had praised him, but Amane felt more like he had been goaded by an enemy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than supported by an ally.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He certainly didn't think of himself as a particularly kindhearted person. He just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    showed the people close to him the respect and affection he thought they deserved. It<p></p>
    <p></p>
    felt wrong to have that confused with kindness.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Awkwardly trying to find anywhere else to look, Amane glanced over at Mahiru and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    saw her blink quickly and smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I've always thought that Amane is an honest and kind person. So much so that I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the one who should be asking for his continued friendship."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that's wonderful. That puts my mind at ease."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wanted to make a quip about his father's mind being at ease, but he was so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shaken by what Mahiru had said that he couldn't think of anything. It was so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    embarrassing to hear her describe him that way. He couldn't even look at her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother laughed as she watched him squirm, but Amane couldn't even respond. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could only bite his lip in tortured silence.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't really need to flatter me, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After Amane's parents had finally departed, he spoke to Mahiru in a quiet voice as they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stood alone in the hallway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had made that remark to relieve the awkward atmosphere somewhat, but for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some reason, Mahiru raised her eyebrows and stared at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her expression was calm, but there was a subtle edge to it that he found intimidating.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do I seem like the type to say empty words I don't mean?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you wouldn't lie to me—but maybe in front of my parents?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She seemed to object to him calling it flattery.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru huffed and then let out a sigh of exasperation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Now see here, I trust you because I think you have a good heart, and I really do like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    spending time with you. I promise: I was not trying to flatter you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "O-oh…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt the heat rushing to his face. Hearing her talk so candidly was terribly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    embarrassing. Fortunately, Mahiru did not seem to notice his unease, and he nodded<p></p>
    <p></p>
    meekly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed satisfied. "As long as you understand. Well, I suppose I'll get started on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lunch."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, Mahiru was going to fix him lunch today, just as she had done every day of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the New Year's holiday. Feeling a mixture of gratitude and shame, Amane looked down<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at Mahiru's golden hair as she placed a hand on the door to his apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Someone she can trust, huh…? That's what I was gonna say.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru ignored the fact that Amane thought she was an angel. To her, he was an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ordinary neighbor. But she trusted him. That was what he was most grateful for.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm so glad I moved here."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru must have heard his quiet mumbling, because she turned around and asked,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did you say something?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, nothing," Amane said quickly, following her into his apartment.<p></p>

    19 A New Semester<p></p>
    A new school semester had started, but not much had changed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Everyone seemed to have spent the winter vacation relaxing, so there weren't any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    major developments the way summer vacation could sometimes bring. The usual cast<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of characters was back, and no one had undergone a drastic image change or anything.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was seated at his desk, quietly gazing at a classroom that was somewhat more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boisterous than usual, when a shadow loomed over him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yo, Amane, what's good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks, can't complain."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was Itsuki, who had entered the classroom from behind Amane's seat. Itsuki was no<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exception and had also remained the same.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hadn't seen him since Christmas, but he was wearing the same flippant smile<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as always.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So did you have a good holiday?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…P-pretty much, yeah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "C'mon, you're holding something back. Was there some kind of… progress?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What? Look, it's not like that. And just so you know, nothing happened."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That wasn't actually true, of course. But Amane wouldn't dream of telling Itsuki that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had stayed over at his place, even if it had been an accident.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He knew the moment he told Itsuki, Itsuki was guaranteed to tell Chitose, and it wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hard to imagine that the two of them would start teasing and poking fun at him first<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chance they got.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Aside from that incident, all that had happened over the break was his parents coming<p></p>
    <p></p>
    over and their communal visit to the shrine, which surely fell into the category of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nothing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I didn't really do anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane found Itsuki's rather triumphant smile pretty irritating but decided that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    responding would just encourage him, so he let it go.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He looked around the classroom, hunting for some topic that would let him change<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the subject… but nothing was particularly new or notable.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As always, the girls were standing around Yuuta Kadowaki, the so-called prince of their<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grade. As always, the boys in the room were openly jealous, even though Yuuta himself<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wore a slightly troubled expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That dynamic hasn't changed one bit," Amane remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, good ol' Yuuta. Same old spectacle, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In the end, Amane, who considered it none of his business, and Itsuki, who had a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girlfriend and wasn't interested in other girls, smiled wryly at Yuuta's popularity and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    continued scanning their familiar surroundings.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come to think of it, I heard that Shiina might have a boyfriend, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A group of several girls formed nearby, and Amane could hear what they were talking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about. He suddenly stiffened.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, Risa told me, yeah. She went on a shrine visit and saw her holding hands with a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I heard! Shiina has never been swayed by anyone before, but maybe that was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    because she had a boyfriend?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sounds like he was a really cool-looking guy, but Risa said she's never seen him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    before. He must be from another school."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Somehow, it felt like the attention of the whole classroom shifted to the girls'<p></p>
    <p></p>
    conversation. Even Yuuta seemed to be looking over and perking up his ears.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Only Itsuki was looking at Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I didn't even ask you anything yet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not involved."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki smiled knowingly at Amane, who had shut him down in a quiet voice, then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    flicked Amane's bangs up and out of the way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Say, you always hide your face, but it's not too shabby."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can't take that as anything but mockery when you say it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki could be a real prankster, and he never seemed to take much of anything<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seriously, and he was definitely a good-looking guy himself, so when he told Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he had an attractive face, it sounded decidedly sarcastic.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane knew he was an average-looking guy at best, and it made him uncomfortable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to hear other people talking about his appearance.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He slapped Itsuki's hand away from his bangs and scowled, but his friend only grinned.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's just the sort of guy you are."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shut up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, can't say it's out of character."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was still acting cold, and Itsuki grinned at him without even a hint of anger.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There's a rumor going around school."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They were still seated across from each other at the dining table after dinner when he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shared the news, and Mahiru's face stiffened, as if she already knew exactly what he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was talking about.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was sure to have the most trouble from the situation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As far as Amane could tell from what he'd heard, he had yet to be identified as the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mystery man, but even so, it must have been exhausting, having everyone suddenly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asking her about having a boyfriend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That must have been why Mahiru was moving stiffly and stepping just a little wearily<p></p>
    <p></p>
    when she came over to Amane's apartment that day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's all right, because no one knows that it was you, Amane, but everyone's really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    taken it the wrong way. This is going to be a difficult misunderstanding to clear up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is holding your hand enough to turn someone into your boyfriend?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't know. For the time being, I've been strongly denying everything, telling people<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that the boy was just an acquaintance. Now we have to wait for the rumor to die down."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm, well, I guess there's nothing else we can do, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Obviously, people would think less of Mahiru if they thought that she was dating a guy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like Amane, so he hoped that the rumors would burn out quickly. She was clearly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stressed, having person after person question her about a maybe-boyfriend.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At the same time, Amane felt an uneasy tinge of regret and embarrassment whenever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he heard the rumors circulating, so he also wanted to put the whole thing behind them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sighed heavily, while Mahiru just quietly cast her eyes downward.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Did we really look that much like sweethearts?" Mahiru suddenly asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wonder. To be honest, I can't really see you ever going out with a guy like me. You'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    definitely go for a smarter, more attractive guy, so I think even if I saw us standing side<p></p>
    <p></p>
    by side, I'd assume we were simply acquaintances rather than boyfriend and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girlfriend."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not true."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had answered him in a stronger voice than expected. When he turned to look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    at her again, she was not wearing the worried face she'd been making earlier. Instead,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for some reason, Mahiru seemed a little… angry. She had a determined look about her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, your assessment of yourself is quite low, but it's not accurate. I think that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you're a very well-balanced person. You're kind and considerate and gentlemanly, so I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    think you've got a very good personality. And when you got all dressed up, I think you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked really nice, too."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her words were far too kind. Amane could scarcely believe that she was talking about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him. His face began to turn bright red. He never would have imagined that Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought so highly of him, and she was saying these things so earnestly that it made<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him feel awkward to be on the receiving end of her praise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, he was not the only one feeling a bit awkward. Midway through, Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    voice had begun to tremble, but she still looked Amane directly in the eye, making sure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he fully understood that this was her honest opinion. Of course, that didn't make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it any less embarrassing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh r-really…? Um, o-okay, thanks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "S-so, um, well… don't put yourself down so much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yeah…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't feel any urge to argue with her. It was obvious that she wouldn't hear it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's cheeks were tinged with red as she squirmed and shifted, looking at the floor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane groaned. He wasn't sure what to do, either. Anything had to be better than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doing nothing while the frustration and humiliation kept bubbling up inside him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Uh, I'm gonna go wash the dishes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "O-okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At the moment, a tactical retreat seemed like the best play. Avoid and escape. Staying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    here to watch Mahiru tremble in shame was bad for his heart.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As he took two deep breaths and then stood up from the table and gathered the dishes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and carried them to the sink, Mahiru sank into the living room sofa and buried her face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in a cushion. She was acting as if she was the one in anguish over getting unexpected<p></p>
    <p></p>
    compliments.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you're that embarrassed," Amane grumbled to himself, "maybe you shouldn't have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    said anything." But he felt as if a slight weight had been lifted off his chest by Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    words. The whole thing had been heart-wrenching, for sure, but also a bit of a relief.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though it was winter, Amane decided to wash the dishes with cold water. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hoped the icy shock would help clear his mind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, hey, Amane? Can I borrow the angel?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The phone call from Chitose came in the evening, three days after the new semester<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had started.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Normally, they would talk through a messaging app, but for some unknown reason,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she actually called him. And she was asking about Mahiru. Amane was really confused.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose asked to borrow Mahiru, but Mahiru's not mine to lend out, so if Chitose wants<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some of her time, she had better ask her herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't ask me. Ask her."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is she there with you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…She is, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, ask her if she wants to hang out together tomorrow after school."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ask her yourself!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He briefly wondered if she didn't have Mahiru's contact information, but then he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    remembered at Christmastime when Chitose had been so busy messing with Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that she had completely forgotten to exchange numbers with the girl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So she must have decided that the best way to get to Mahiru was through Amane, who<p></p>
    <p></p>
    definitely had Mahiru's contact information and could often be found right beside her,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too. He could understand the thought process, but he wanted to tell her that he wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a carrier pigeon, delivering messages back and forth like it was his job.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For the time being, he decided that she had better talk to Mahiru directly, so he handed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the phone over to Mahiru, who was sitting next to him looking confused, and told her,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Chitose wants to talk to you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked perplexed but dutifully took the smartphone and held it up to her ear<p></p>
    <p></p>
    as Amane leaned back in his seat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru here… Huh, tomorrow? S-sure, I don't have any particular plans, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane smiled mischievously as he watched Mahiru's troubled expression.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I bet Chitose's putting the pressure on her by talking a mile a minute like always.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't look upset or anything. She just seemed earnestly surprised by the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sudden proposal and unsure how to handle it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was shooting glances over at Amane, so he told her, "I'll leave it up to your<p></p>
    <p></p>
    judgment. She wants to hang out with you, not me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even Mahiru hung out with friends sometimes, but she preferred to come home after<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a few hours and spend her time in the kitchen.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought that she could do with an excuse to go relax a bit, though he wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    entirely sure that hanging out with Chitose really lent itself to relaxation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "S-sure… Um, in that case, I think I'll accept your invitation, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Perhaps Amane's assurance had been the deciding factor. When she told Chitose as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    much, the happy "Yay!!" from the other end of the phone line was clearly audible, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru reflexively pulled the phone away from her ear.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane caught Mahiru's eye and gave her a knowing smile. Chitose could be… a lot to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    handle. Mahiru also smiled, looking a bit nervous but also relieved and even happy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Chitose finally settled down, Mahiru returned the phone to her ear. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    watched them chat for another moment or two before Mahiru eventually hung up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thank you very much," she said politely. "Here's your phone back."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Their conversation had apparently reached a resolution, and tomorrow she would be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    joining Chitose on some excursion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that was sudden. Then again, that's how Chitose always operates."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "W-well, I certainly was surprised."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She's not a bad person. She can just be a little forceful."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane knew that was quite the understatement. Chitose usually meant well, but she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could definitely be pushy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru wore a troubled smile, as if she already knew that, but she didn't seem upset,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so that was good, Amane thought. He'd always found it a little sad how few people got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    along with their buddies' girlfriends.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Go have fun tomorrow; don't worry about me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Oh, that's right—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was one thing that Amane had to warn her about.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If she starts harassing you or makes you uncomfortable, feel free to give her a smack.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    You don't have to hold back. That girl is exactly like my mom—she loves cute things,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so she's almost certainly going to get handsy with a beauty like you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had managed to keep Chitose in check before, but now he was a little worried<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to be sending Mahiru off alone with her. Mahiru was undeniably beautiful—she turned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    heads wherever she went. He knew she had to be careful about getting hit on by<p></p>
    <p></p>
    strangers, but Chitose was another matter. Yes, he had relied on Chitose's keen insight<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the occasion of Mahiru's birthday, but he also knew that when it came to cute<p></p>
    <p></p>
    things, the girl just couldn't help herself. Amane felt it was necessary to at least warn<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru about Chitose's wandering hands.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now, I don't think she's going to bother you too much, but if you only give her a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    halfhearted rejection, she's bound to get excited and pounce you, so be careful." Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    noticed that Mahiru's lips were pressed tightly together so he cocked his head<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quizzically and asked, "Hey, what's up?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Nothing at all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru quietly averted her eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    On the day that Mahiru was supposed to hang out with Chitose, Amane hurried home<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and spent some quiet time alone for the first time in a while.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recently, he and Mahiru had been spending pretty much every day together, especially<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with her making his lunch sometimes, so this was almost like a holiday for Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, he was happy that they were together so often… but sometimes it was nice<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to have space to himself like this, too.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The seat beside him felt a little cold, though.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Man, I really got used to having Mahiru around, huh?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Only a few months had passed since they'd first met, and he was already taking her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    presence for granted. Amane felt like they'd gotten very close, more like two people<p></p>
    <p></p>
    who'd known each other for years, rather than months. He figured that they must be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    quite compatible.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Personally, Amane really liked where they were in their relationship—they were close<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough to enjoy the time they spent together without stepping on each other's toes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The only problem was, he liked it so much that he didn't want to let go.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Man, I'm simpleminded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't the kind of guy to come out and passionately declare his love, but he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couldn't deny that his feelings for Mahiru went far beyond those of a neighbor and a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    friend. At the same time, he refused to allow himself to develop any serious romantic<p></p>
    <p></p>
    interest in her. If he let the scales tip any further, he didn't think he would be able to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    see Mahiru as a friend anymore. Amane was aware of the tension in his heart, and it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    made him deeply uneasy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That's why he took his romantic feelings and stuffed them deep down in his gut where<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nobody would see them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru would only be troubled by his affection, he knew. She cared about him in her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    own way, but it was obvious that she was not in love with him or anything like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was no way that she would ever fall for a loser like him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sure, she sometimes said nice things about him, but that didn't mean she thought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about him that way, and if he tried to complicate their relationship by taking it in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    direction that she didn't like, it would only make things awkward.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane turned to look out the window, hoping to get away from the squirming<p></p>
    <p></p>
    uneasiness in his chest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was winter, so the days ended early, and a curtain of utter darkness had fallen over<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the sky. It was just past six o'clock, but it already seemed late at night.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was with Chitose, so she wasn't going to be out too late, but even so, he felt a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    little anxious at the idea of two good-looking high school girls walking around alone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in this darkness.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When will you two be done?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he sent this message to Chitose, who always kept her smartphone close, he got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a reply right away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    We're saying good-bye soon.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Feeling relieved that Chitose wasn't going to keep them out all night, Amane sent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    another message asking when they expected to get to the station. Then he stood up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from the sofa and headed for the bathroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I think I have a little hair wax left over from the other day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He wasn't all that interested in styling his hair, but if he was planning to go meet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru in public, it was the least he could do.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he was being honest, getting dressed up was a huge pain, but Amane's parents had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    taught him how to make himself presentable. Surely he could reproduce the hairstyle<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from memory.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he looked in the mirror, Amane saw his usual gloomy self staring back at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He popped open the hair wax, confident that he could transform the uncouth,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unfashionable youth standing before him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was the middle of winter, and on top of that, the sun had set, so the temperature had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dipped quite low.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After considering both warmth and fashion, Amane decided on a light-gray sweater<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and navy blue peacoat, paired with fleece-lined black skinny jeans, but even so, he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    undeniably cold. He could only imagine how cold Mahiru must have felt in only her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school uniform and jacket.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though Mahiru wore thick tights during the winter, her uniform's skirt, its length<p></p>
    <p></p>
    determined by school regulations, still looked downright freezing to him. He wanted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to tell her it'd be better to wear sweatpants underneath it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Some of the girls he walked past were wearing even shorter skirts. Amane was keenly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    aware of the tremendous lengths some people would go to in pursuit of fashion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As these thoughts bounced around in his mind, he nestled the lower half of his face in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the scarf he had received from Mahiru and hurried to the nearest station.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, the girls had taken the train to a big shopping complex. The station was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    within walking distance of Amane's apartment, and according to Chitose, the train<p></p>
    <p></p>
    should be arriving any moment, so he had probably shown up at just the right time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane walked, his freshly styled hair was blown about a bit by the wind, but not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    badly enough to mess it up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If it had gotten too ruffled, of course he would have had to stop to fix it, however<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reluctant he might be. Amane was quickly gaining a newfound respect for anyone who<p></p>
    <p></p>
    strove to be fashionable every day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was walking silently, lost in his own thoughts, when the station came into view.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Considering the direction of the apartment complex, Mahiru should come out of this exit,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so if I wait nearby, I'm sure I'll see her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He leaned against the wall near the exit and waited, checking the time. Before long, a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girl with familiar blond hair came out of the gates.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru!" he called out to her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Recognizing his voice, Mahiru turned to look—and the moment she laid eyes on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane, she practically froze.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah… what? Wh-why?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was obviously surprised by his appearance. Chitose must have told her that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was coming to meet her, but she clearly hadn't expected him to show up looking like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had during their New Year's shrine visit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But Amane hadn't even entertained the idea of coming out with his usual sloppy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    appearance and normal hairdo. He would be in trouble if someone identified him as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the mystery man, so if he was going to accompany Mahiru in public, he needed to dress<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up a bit. He had to disguise himself, of course, but he also felt like he should look<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decent if he was going to be seen with her in public.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What, did you think I couldn't dress myself? I can't exactly come meet you at the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    station in my normal clothes, now can I?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I suppose not, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Does it look bad? I checked myself in the mirror, but maybe it's weird…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had chosen an ordinary, safe outfit and tried to style his hair like it had been on the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    day of the shrine visit, so Amane had hoped that he didn't look too strange. But now<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he realized that it probably looked all wrong to anybody with real taste.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He could feel people's gazes flicker over him from time to time, so there was a good<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chance that he did look weird after all. It was a bit of a shock to realize that he looked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unfashionable despite trying his best.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But Mahiru shook her head, appearing flustered. "It looks good," she reassured him,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and Amane felt himself breathe a sigh of relief.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm glad you think so. Look, it's already dark, right? It would be dangerous to walk<p></p>
    <p></p>
    home alone."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I kn-know that, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I guess you probably didn't want me to come meet you after all. Well, if you don't want<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to walk together, I can walk a little ways ahead, and you can just follow me, I guess…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I—I never said that. I, umm… really do appreciate it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was happy to hear that she didn't object to him being there. He pulled a hand<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out of his pocket and offered it to her. Timidly, she pressed her palm into his. Maybe it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was because of the cold weather, but her hand felt much chillier than he expected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So cold. What happened to your gloves?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I washed them, so they're still drying. And anyway, where are yours?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I just stuck my hands in my pockets."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He couldn't scold her too much, since he'd also forgotten to wear gloves, a lesson he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    should have learned as a child.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't say anything further and simply kept her dainty hand nestled in his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    palm. It felt incredibly delicate compared to his.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…So warm…," Mahiru mumbled quietly, and her eyes twinkled happily as she smiled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt his heart wrench when he saw her innocent expression, but he refused to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    let it show and kept his attention solely focused on her small hand in his as he casually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slipped Mahiru's schoolbag, as well as several shopping bags she'd acquired on her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    outing, over his shoulder.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru glanced up at him but didn't say anything.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What is it?" he asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Abruptly, Mahiru turned away. Her ears and cheeks were slightly red, probably from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the cold, he thought.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on, let's go home. Do you want to stop at the convenience store on the way? The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pork buns are good this time of year."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm happy with a sweet bean bun."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You sure do like sweets… What are we doing about dinner?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I've marinated some eggs and prepared some char siu pork and bamboo shoots, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    we're having ramen."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ramen is perfect on a cold day, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, it is."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hadn't looked in the refrigerator, so he was pleasantly surprised to hear the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    evening's menu. Sure, the soup and noodles would be prepackaged, but Mahiru had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    made the toppings by hand. Amane's mouth started to water as he imagined the thick<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slices of pork and perfectly seasoned soft-boiled eggs.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They were sure to hit the spot on a chilly winter evening.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I wonder if I'll be able to eat a whole bowl of ramen after a bean bun?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well then, how about you give me half? That way, you can probably finish both."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For some reason, Mahiru looked a little embarrassed, so Amane smiled slightly and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    squeezed her hand just a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shiina was spotted with another mystery man!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The following day, Itsuki shot him a hard look. "Not only are the rumors still spreading,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    somebody added fuel to the fire. What're ya gonna do, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane turned away sharply. "Hell if I know…"<p></p>

    20 The Angel in Poor Health<p></p>
    It happened on a Friday, on one of the last days of January.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane returned to the living room after cleaning up dinner, but when he looked at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru, he noticed that her cheeks were unusually red.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    At first, he thought that maybe the thermostat was set too high, but it was on the same<p></p>
    <p></p>
    temperature as always, and Mahiru wasn't wearing particularly warm clothing, either.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he looked closely, he saw that her expression seemed distant and kind of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unfocused. Her breathing was also shallower than usual. All signs pointed to her being<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sick.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he took a moment to think about it, the weather had gotten much colder lately,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and Mahiru, as an honors student, had been busy helping her teacher with some big<p></p>
    <p></p>
    project. On top of that, she was doing her usual housework and making dinner for the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    two of them. It wasn't strange at all for her to fall ill with such a workload.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane admonished himself for not noticing her condition earlier. He regretted not<p></p>
    <p></p>
    paying more attention to her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, your face is red. Do you think you have a fever?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Of course not."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru decisively dismissed Amane's concerns. Her expression was stiff, and she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shook her head, but she couldn't hide the redness in her cheeks.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Obviously, he couldn't just take her word for it, so even though he knew that it was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rude to touch her without her permission, Amane gently placed the palm of his hand<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on Mahiru's forehead, which was usually hidden by her bangs.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As he had expected, her head was much hotter than his palm. Mahiru's typical body<p></p>
    <p></p>
    temperature wasn't that high compared to Amane's, so it was pretty clear she had a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fever.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're hot as the sun."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…No, I'm not."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, how about we take your temperature and confirm it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There's no need. You're worrying over nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her voice was thin and lacked her usual energy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, come on. I can tell by looking at you that you're running a fever."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm just a bit flushed."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If that's the case, then you'll need to take your temperature and prove it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane stood up and retrieved a thermometer from the first aid box on the shelf in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    living room. He brought it back to Mahiru, but she turned her face away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She either didn't want to acknowledge her fever, or she insisted on bluffing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was probably one or the other, but Amane couldn't really proceed until she agreed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to have her temperature taken. He stood right in front of the uncooperative Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and placed the thermometer firmly in her hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, either I can loosen your clothes and stick the thermometer in your armpit,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    or you can take your own temperature… Which do you prefer?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane put on a very serious face when he made this threat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru let out a startled groan and turned her body toward the back of the sofa. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed like she had resigned herself to it, and he heard the sound of the thermometer<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turning on, so just to be safe, Amane also turned his back to Mahiru and waited for her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to finish.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Before long, he heard another electronic beep. Amane waited for Mahiru to put her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clothes back in order. When he turned around, she was looking at him, expressionless,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    holding the thermometer in its case.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thirty-seven point two degrees Celsius. A slight fever, all right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's only a little higher than usual, and I still feel totally fine, so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane took the thermometer from Mahiru's hand and removed it from the case again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The thermometer Amane had used was the type that recorded the previously measured<p></p>
    <p></p>
    temperature, and when he turned it on again—sure enough, it displayed a temperature<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more than one whole degree higher than Mahiru had reported.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh yeah? I see thirty-eight point four here."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She averted her eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Seriously, have you been running yourself ragged and letting me sit on my butt the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whole time? You're taking all day tomorrow and tomorrow night off. No buts."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane caught a cold, Mahiru had put him to bed and had him change into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pajamas and brought him rice porridge, but he wondered how she would fare doing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nothing when it was her turn.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had a relatively sturdy constitution, so he'd simply gone to sleep and woken<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up feeling better, but if Mahiru didn't rest and kept running around, she would never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    recover, even from something relatively minor. Mahiru was sick, and that meant no<p></p>
    <p></p>
    straining herself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, Mahiru was still avoiding his gaze. She didn't seem likely to agree to a strict<p></p>
    <p></p>
    regimen of bed rest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …So stubborn… Well, I guess there's no other way, then.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane extended a hand to Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The fever was slowing her down, and it took her a moment to turn to him. Thinking<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that it would be just perfect if she didn't resist, Amane put his arms around Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    back and under her knees and lifted her off the sofa.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Carrying her like a child, so that she had to cling tightly to him, Amane checked that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he could hear the sound of jangling keys from Mahiru's pocket and headed for the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    door.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, A-Amane…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed to finally realize that she was being carried, and he heard her flustered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    voice coming from between his arms.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane stopped for a moment and looked down at her, Mahiru's cheeks were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    still red with fever, and she was peering up at him with confusion in her eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're definitely going to push yourself too hard, so I'm going to keep watch until you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fall asleep."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-you're going to barge into a girl's bedroom?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you don't like that idea, you can sleep in my room."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…And the option for you to leave me alone…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That ship sailed when you refused to rest."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even Amane knew that no matter how close of a friend he was, going into a girl's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apartment, and what's more, into her bedroom, and standing guard until she fell<p></p>
    <p></p>
    asleep, would be a serious invasion of her privacy. It was definitely not something he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would ever even consider under normal circumstances. But after seeing the way she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was acting, he was seriously worried for her health. He just knew that Mahiru would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    run herself into the ground if he didn't do something. As far as he was concerned, there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't any other option.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Long ago, Mahiru had forced her way into his apartment, so he figured that just this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    once, he would employ the same forceful measures for her sake.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay, which do you prefer? My house or yours?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…And if I say I don't like either?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you say that, then we default to barging into your apartment so I can toss you into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bed."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Your room is fine…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, Mahiru didn't want Amane bursting into her bedroom, so she finally<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relented and agreed to rest in Amane's room instead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane exhaled hard—neither a sigh nor a breath of relief. I understand why she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wouldn't want to let a boy into her room, he thought as he carried her to his bed. And I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    know she didn't make a huge fuss, either. But if she was going to be so stubborn about it,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I wish she would have just stayed home and rested up in the first place.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru hadn't been in Amane's bedroom since New Year's.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For the moment, he lowered Mahiru onto the bed, then started fishing through his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dresser drawers. He figured it would be best if she changed into something she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wouldn't have to worry about getting sweat on before going to sleep. He chose the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smallest shirt and sweatpants he had, then set them down by Mahiru's side.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here. Change into these."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…But—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Or I can strip you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'll get changed…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru reluctantly picked up the change of clothes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was not at all prepared to carry out his threat, and he didn't think Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would have let him anyway. Just thinking about it made him want to die of shame. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was thoroughly relieved to hear that she would play along.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since he wasn't about to stay and watch her change, Amane quickly left the room and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    retrieved some sports drinks from his pantry shelf.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After Amane had recovered from his cold the previous year, he had stocked up on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    prepackaged rice porridge, extra sports drinks, and cooling sheets. His preparations<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were finally paying off.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Carrying the supplies, along with a towel and some medicine, Amane knocked on the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    door of his own bedroom and heard a small voice reply, "I've finished changing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He entered and saw Mahiru looking at him, propped up on his bed, wearing his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    clothes. As expected, even the smallest clothes he had were too large on Mahiru—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    baggy was probably the most accurate word.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She looked adorable, dressed in clothes that were the wrong size, but Amane drove<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that thought from his mind and set down the sports drinks and towel on the table<p></p>
    <p></p>
    beside the bed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Will you take some medicine? It's over-the-counter stuff."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Sure. I have the same type at home, so I think it's all right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He went back to the kitchen for a moment and filled a cup with water. While he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there, he fished an ice pack out of the freezer. He recalled the saying "Preparation is<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the key to success" and smiled to himself about how true that was turning out to be.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hurried back to the bedroom and handed the water to Mahiru, then took some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pills out of the packaging and put them in her open palm.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Take those and drink plenty of water. Then get to sleep."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While Mahiru was swallowing the medicine, he wrapped the ice pack in the towel and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    set it beside her pillow. As he did, he heard Mahiru mumble "…You're pretty well<p></p>
    <p></p>
    prepared."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm just doing everything you did for me, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Basically, he was just repeating exactly what Mahiru had done when she nursed him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    back to health. He was healthy now, so it was only natural that he should return the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    favor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "By the way, why were you trying to push yourself so hard?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Because I'm incapable of effective self-management."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look, you have to draw the line somewhere. You're always running around, working<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hard, and your body is probably all worn out. Come to think of it, I guess I owe you an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apology for my part in keeping you so busy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Making his dinner every night had undoubtedly placed an extra burden on Mahiru that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she clearly didn't need. She had her own life to deal with, and here she was taking care<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of him. It was inexcusable, really.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's fever seemed to be connected to her fatigue, so Amane wanted to care of her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the best he could and let her rest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I've never thought of you as a burden, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Really…? Well, even if that's true, think of this as a good opportunity for you to take it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    easy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was happy to hear her say that she didn't find the time they spent together to be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    taxing, but he still felt guilty about how much attention she had paid to his needs. This<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was his chance to tend to Mahiru while she got some rest. It would probably actually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    be better to send her home, but Amane wanted to stay by her side. He knew he would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    never forgive himself if anything happened to her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru hesitated but eventually agreed to lie down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She buried everything up to her neck under the comforter, then glanced at Amane. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked slightly embarrassed, probably because she didn't like having someone standing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    over her while she slept. Amane was about to leave her alone, thinking that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shouldn't stare at girls in their sleep, when he felt something tug at his sleeve. When<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he looked down, he found Mahiru's small hand grasping at his shirt.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was also staring at her hand, caramel-colored eyes wide with shock. She looked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just as surprised as he did. A moment passed, and then she quickly released him and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    buried herself completely under the comforter, pulling it all the way up over her face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to hide.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Good night," came a feeble mumble from Mahiru, cocooned in the blanket.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane scratched his cheek, unsure what to do.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …She gets really anxious when she's not feeling well, huh?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Figuring she would probably forgive him, he turned back the comforter a little bit,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    until he found Mahiru's hand and grabbed hold of it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He squeezed it gently, and Mahiru stuck her face out from under the comforter, wearing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a troubled expression. But Amane had a feeling that was more from embarrassment<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than anger.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm not a child, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know. I'll just be here keeping watch so that you won't run away, so don't mind me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm not running away this late in the game."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I wonder. Well, I'll get out of here once you're asleep, so you can relax. Come on, if you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want me to leave, hurry up and fall asleep."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was being very direct. But it worked. Mahiru meekly snuggled back down<p></p>
    <p></p>
    under the comforter, and he felt her squeeze his hand back.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He felt sort of happy, and embarrassed, and for some reason, agitated. It was like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone was tickling the inside of his chest.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane kept hold of her slender fingers until he heard her peaceful sleeping breaths.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The following morning, Amane woke up on the sofa and checked the clock as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stretched his stiff body.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was just past eight in the morning. It wasn't a school day, and he almost never got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up this early on the weekends, but Amane wanted to see how Mahiru was doing, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    decided he'd better get a move on. He had peeked in on her just in case during the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    night and confirmed that she looked like she was sleeping peacefully, but he couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tell what her true condition was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He stood up and stretched, then quietly headed toward his own bedroom and opened<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the door without making a sound.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hadn't knocked in case Mahiru was still sleeping, but when he opened the door, she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sat up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Her cheeks were still slightly red, but not as red as the night before, and although her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression was slack and somewhat bleary, her eyes focused when she spotted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Morning. How are you feeling? The truth, please."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm still sluggish."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Gotcha. I'm going to the convenience store to buy breakfast and something that you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    might be able to eat."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He did have that rice porridge, but he had the image that sick people ate meal<p></p>
    <p></p>
    supplement jelly and canned peaches and thought those might be easier to eat, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that's what he was planning to get.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was relieved to find that she seemed to be doing better than expected, and he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pulled another change of clothes out of the dresser and set them on the bed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm leaving you a change of clothes here. Make sure you take your temperature, too.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If you want to wipe off the sweat, go ahead and use the water in that wash basin and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this towel."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Before leaving the room, Amane pointed to the basin he had used to wipe the sweat<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from her face during the night.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Then he retrieved his wallet and left the apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Walking at a leisurely pace, Amane made sure that Mahiru would have plenty of time<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to wipe herself off and change her clothes, even if her fever slowed her down. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    convenience store was located quite close to their apartment building, so he could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have made the trip in just a few minutes, but he was careful and took his time shopping.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane returned home after spending a solid twenty minutes out of the house and put<p></p>
    <p></p>
    away the cold items in the refrigerator. When he finally went in to see Mahiru, she had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    finished changing and was waiting for him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She also seemed more alert and already looked healthier than the day before. She was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smiling faintly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Any fever?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thirty-seven point five degrees."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm, still slightly high… Don't move around too much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I kn-know that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Do you have an appetite? I've got some rice porridge here, and I also bought pudding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and jelly."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He knew he shouldn't let her eat anything too heavy, so he had brought back things<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that were easy to eat and soft, but what she ate would depend on Mahiru's appetite.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, sorry you went to the—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't apologize. You did the same thing for me. So pudding or jelly, which do you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Jelly."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here ya go. Do you think you can eat some rice porridge as well?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, I'll heat it up; so you sit tight."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane shuffled out of the room. He was concerned about Mahiru. She seemed anxious.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane placed a pouch of rice porridge in some hot water to warm it up, then poured<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it into a bowl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he was really going to repay Mahiru for what she did last time, he probably should<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have made the porridge by hand, but he honestly wasn't sure he would have been able<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to pull it off without messing up something, so he'd decided to fall back on the reliable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    instant pouches.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was sure it would be nothing next to Mahiru's homemade porridge, but Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    figured the most important thing was that she had something, anything, to eat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here. Think you can manage to eat on your own?" Amane asked her jokingly as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    held out a spoon and waited for her to take the bowl of porridge.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru scowled at him sullenly. "Are you making fun of me? And what if I said I can't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    eat on my own—I suppose you'd offer to feed me?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, I mean… I'll feed you if you want, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's face went red, as if her fever had made a sudden comeback.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I-I'll eat by myself."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yeah."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She accepted the bowl from Amane and started taking small bites, but the redness did<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not disappear by the time she was done eating.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She seemed to still have some appetite after finishing the porridge, so she opened the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    jelly next. Once she put that away as well, she sighed. She looked much better now, so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all that was left was to get some rest so she could regain her strength. Amane was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    rather relieved.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is there anything else you want me to do?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Nothing for now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane stood up to leave, thinking that he should probably just let her rest more,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru slowly looked up at him, as if making some sort of request. Her gaze was steady<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and direct.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sensing the fear and anxiety lurking behind her caramel-colored eyes, Amane sat<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down right next to Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's nothing."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If he told her up front that she seemed lonely, Mahiru would probably deny it outright<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and chase him away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    So Amane sat quietly by the bedside and simply looked over at Mahiru, who was sitting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up in bed. "I'm not busy right now anyway. How about we just chat until you get a little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sleepy?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Okay." She nodded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He smiled at her as he leaned against the bed, and Mahiru also smiled faintly as if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reassured.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…This is the first time someone's ever really taken care of me when I'm sick… Even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Miss Koyuki went home when her shift was over."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Miss Koyuki?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The maid who worked for us when I was at home."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, the person who taught you how to cook?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I was always alone in the mornings and evenings, so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I'm here now. Besides, I'll be in a serious pinch if you don't hurry up and get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    well."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm sorry for using your bed. And about dinner…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not what I meant. It's awful, you know? I just want to see my friend get better."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though they had only known each other a relatively short while, after all the time<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they'd spent together, it was only natural for Amane to worry about her. Even if she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hadn't been running herself ragged taking care of him among other things, Amane still<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would have worried about her. She was his friend, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And besides, I'm not the type of person who celebrates when someone else gets sick."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I know that already. You're a nice person, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yes, ma'am."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was a little embarrassed and felt awkward being told directly to his face that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was nice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Go ahead and get some rest… You'll feel better if you sleep as much as you need."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Shall I stand guard until you drift off again?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane made a joke to hide his embarrassment, but Mahiru blinked in surprise.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yes, please do."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You suggested it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I did, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He never imagined that she would accept. He had expected Mahiru to glow bright red<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and immediately reject the idea. His eyes went wide in surprise, and now Mahiru was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the one wearing an impish smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Or does a man go back on his word?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Absolutely not. Time to lie down," Amane muttered quietly. Then he added "You win<p></p>
    <p></p>
    this round" as he squeezed Mahiru's hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She slipped under the covers. Then she looked at her hand resting in Amane's, and her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression softened.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…It's so warm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Your fever must have gone down a lot, if you've cooled off… All right, get some sleep."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She squeezed his hand once in return. She looked like she was relieved that he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there after all. Slowly, her eyes drifted closed, and before long, Amane could hear the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    regular rhythm of her sleeping breath.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …You dummy, he groaned, covering his face with his other hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whenever the two of them touched like this, Amane lost his cool. His heart was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pounding in his ears, and his face felt so hot that, for a moment, he wondered if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's fever had jumped hosts. Amane was so flushed that he almost forgot which<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of them was supposed to have the fever.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …This girl is really bad for my heart.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane glanced over at Mahiru and saw her sleeping peacefully, entirely relaxed and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    blissfully ignorant of Amane's woes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane swore under his breath and buried his face in the bedsheets.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was his bed, but it had a sweet scent, a little different from his own.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane came to, Mahiru's warmth had disappeared.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The hand he had been holding was gone, leaving Amane facedown in the bed, all alone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He looked around the room in alarm, but Mahiru was obviously not in bed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane looked at the clock on the side table, saw that it was two, and then realized<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he had crashed. He thought maybe it was because he had gotten up to check on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru during the night, but even so, Amane had never intended to sleep for so long.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Flustered, Amane stood up and headed for the living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He moved briskly, and it wasn't long before he saw Mahiru sitting with good posture on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the living room sofa. She wasn't dressed in his shirt and sweatpants anymore, but in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    her own clothing, which likely meant that she'd gone home for a bit before returning.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, good morning."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Morning. You weren't there when I woke up, so I panicked a little."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry. I took a quick shower and came back."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That must have been why she had changed clothes. Feeling relieved that she was well<p></p>
    <p></p>
    enough to bathe, he pressed his palm against Mahiru's forehead just in case, but she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was already back to her usual temperature.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm, seems like your fever broke. That's great."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm sorry for worrying you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You should be. Next time I'm going to do the same exact thing if you're not honest<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He said this as he was taking a seat next to Mahiru, and she frowned uneasily.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'll be careful, but… Amane, won't you be angry if I cause you trouble again?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Trouble?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Because you had to nurse me and everything…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "As if I'd ever consider any of that trouble, you dummy. Do I honestly seem that heartless<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Not at all. It's just… I was only wondering if it's all right to rely on you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You should rely on people for whatever you can. You're definitely the type who tries<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to take everything upon yourself even when you don't need to."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They had only been together for a few months, but even so, Amane thought he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    understood Mahiru's temperament pretty well.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She fundamentally didn't like to rely on other people, and she bottled up all her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feelings deep inside and tried to never let them show. She seemed like she shut herself<p></p>
    <p></p>
    off from other people by building a wall that she didn't want anyone to slip behind.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, I know that I'm not very trustworthy, and you can't rely on me, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Th-that's not true! I trust you a lot, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good. Then don't force yourself and let me help you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without thinking, he reached out and ruffled Mahiru's hair, only after which he noticed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Mahiru had gone completely still.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry. You hate that, don't you?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Not exactly, no…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru shook her head slowly, not to disentangle his hand from her hair, but to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    disagree with his statement, then leaned her forehead against his upper arm.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His heart leaped in his chest when he felt the slight weight of her body pressing against<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him, but without revealing it in the least, he patted her head once more. He heard a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    truly quiet little whisper: "…Thank you so much."<p></p>

    21 Valentine’s Day<p></p>
    By the beginning of February, rumors concerning Mahiru's "mystery man, possible<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boyfriend" finally died down, despite the fact that Amane had carelessly added fuel to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the fire by picking her up from the station.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even so, the idea of a boy who was not her boyfriend but was still very close to Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed to have taken root instead, and the new rumor was that Mahiru had feelings<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for that boy… but Mahiru cheerfully denied it all in her friendly but ultimately<p></p>
    <p></p>
    unyielding way, so eventually the stream of gossip dried up.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had heard from Chitose, who had been observing the situation in the hallways,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that "her denial left no room for argument," so it seemed like Mahiru was pretty upset.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He wasn't surprised, but he was a little sad to hear how vehemently she was denying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it. Still, he knew there wasn't much to be done about it. The current situation was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably driving Mahiru crazy, having to listen to all these wild rumors about a guy<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she didn't even like that way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could do nothing but wear a wry smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So speaking of February…," Chitose prodded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh yeah, final exams are coming up," Amane said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You know, for a teenage boy, you sure lack imagination."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose didn't hide her disapproval at his reply.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She had paid him a visit at his apartment after school—or rather, she had barged in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    without an invitation—on the pretense that she had something important to discuss,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though Amane was pretty sure she'd actually come to hang out with Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Incidentally, Mahiru was in the kitchen putting on a pot of tea, so Amane and Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were alone in the living room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't know about other high school guys and their imaginations, but I'd say that's a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reasonable train of thought for any student…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "A high school guy in the prime of his life should be thinking about Valentine's Day,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    don't you think?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not in the prime of anything so no…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There you go again!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose was giving him a mischievous look even though she should know better than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    most that there was no truth behind the rumors.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane glared at her, but her smile refused to crack. "So…," he said with a sigh, "what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    did you want to talk about?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose had made a point to come to Amane's apartment alone. She obviously had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something she wanted to discuss with Amane and Mahiru, but not with her boyfriend,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm. I wanted to ask you what I should do about chocolates for Itsuki. When we were<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in middle school, I made him chocolates out of a kit, the kind where you melt the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chocolate and pour it into a mold, but since we're high schoolers now, I'd like to make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something more sophisticated."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "In that case, Shiina's the one you oughtta ask."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After all, Amane knew nothing about cooking. At most, he might be able to offer some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    insight into his best friend's tastes, but Chitose had actually been dating Itsuki for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    longer than Amane had known him, so she probably knew what Itsuki liked better<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than he did.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm gonna ask her, too, but I thought since you're sorta a guy… you know? Maybe I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could get a male opinion."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not sorta anything. I'm all man."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If you were a real man, you'd have made a move on a certain pretty girl by now,"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose said slyly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Now, listen," Amane said with a grimace, "I've explained this before—we don't have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that sort of relationship. And besides, a real man is supposed to wait until he's in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relationship to make a move."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, how wonderfully chivalrous of you," Chitose teased. "Your mama must have raised<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose might think he was uptight, but Amane didn't see anything wrong with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wanting to take it slow. Sure, plenty of guys could mess around with girls they didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even like, but could wasn't the same as should. More importantly, Amane couldn't see<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself doing that, especially if the other party just wasn't interested.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now, it would have been a lie to say that he didn't have certain feelings for Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Spending time with a girl so beautiful—inside and out—would stir up those sorts of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    emotions in most any man.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But even then, the foolish idea to try something with had her never surfaced.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Whenever he thought about it, all kinds of other things got in the way—worrying<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about hurting her feelings, worrying that she might come to hate him, worrying that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he did not appreciate her enough.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Also, Mahiru had made it quite clear that trying anything would result in serious social<p></p>
    <p></p>
    repercussions, as well as grievous physical harm to a certain vital organ, and he did<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not think that she was bluffing.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that's one of your good points, Amane, and I'm sure it's why Mahirun feels like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she can trust you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose had started referring to Mahiru by a nickname that had a cute ring to it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was listening in from the kitchen, but she didn't stop Chitose from calling her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that, so whether she was reluctant or comfortable with the name herself, she must<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have known that she had a nickname now.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As far as Mahiru was concerned, it was better than being called an angel to her face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Though sometimes I wonder whether you're really a man at all…," Chitose continued.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can assure you, I am. I mean, have you ever seen a girl this flat?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, you're much too passive. A man is supposed to be a little ferocious sometimes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You think a guy like me could pull off ferocious?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You'd be fine if you dressed the part like those other times. Honestly, I'd like to see it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for myself."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki and Chitose had long since deduced that Amane was Mahiru's mystery man, and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had finally acknowledged it just the other day, so there was no point in hiding it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    now. But he wasn't about to get all dressed up just for their amusement.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Give it up already."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Come on; it's no big deeeal!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I can't spare the hair wax—or the patience, for that matter."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Cheapskate!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Mahiru returned from the kitchen carrying a tray with three cups of milk tea,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose had puffed out her cheeks and was pouting at him. Mahiru smiled as she set<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the tray on the coffee table.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sprung up from the sofa and moved to a cushion on the floor, gesturing for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru to sit down. She gingerly took the now-vacant seat, looking apologetic.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But if you look good enough to gossip about," Chitose continued, "imagine how<p></p>
    <p></p>
    popular you'd be if you dressed that way all the time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way. It's a huge hassle, and I don't even wanna be popular in the first place."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whaaat? Not even with Valentine's Day coming up? Don't you want to get lots of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chocolate, Amane? Like, he's just one example, but Yuu's super popular, and it seems<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like he gets tons of chocolates. Aren't you the slightest bit jealous?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way. I'd get diabetes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    By Yuu, Chitose must have been referring to Yuuta. Assigning weird nicknames to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    people seemed to be one of Chitose's many habits. Fortunately, she hadn't gotten<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around to thinking of one for Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Maybe Yuuta—dubbed the prince—did receive tons of chocolate, but there was no<p></p>
    <p></p>
    way he could eat it all without getting fat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Anyway, it's depressing just to think about the returns," Amane added. "I mean,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    between the chocolates people just give out to be polite and the ones people give out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to confess their feelings, Kadowaki's probably on the receiving end of several dozen<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gifts, and then he has to pay all those back threefold. That's gotta be hell on a high<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school student's wallet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How admirable to assume that he's going to pay everything back threefold. Well, I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    going to give you some chocolate, and you don't need to worry about return gifts or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anything like that. What kind do you like?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not really into sweet things, so… something not too sweet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Got it; I'll come up with something."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't put anything funny in there."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's fine; it'll all be edible."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't sure what Chitose was planning, but he was definitely expecting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    something more than an ordinary box of chocolates.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahirun, who are you giving chocolate to?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The girls I'm friends with in my class."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not to any boys?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…If I give anyone chocolate, even courtesy chocolate, they take it the wrong way, so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah-ha."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could easily imagine the uproar among the boys—and the pointless fighting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that was sure to follow. Most of the boys in his class would treat chocolate from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school angel like mana from heaven, so if word got around that Mahiru was giving out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chocolate, it would definitely mean trouble. Amane wasn't sure whether Mahiru's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    popularity or the boys' foolishness was more to blame.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Obviously, it's safer for Mahiru to avoid giving out any chocolate at all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane nodded and smiled to himself.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, and I'll also save some chocolate for you, Chitose."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yaaay! I love you, Mahirun. I'll give you some, too. The real stuff, not like what I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    giving Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I heard that!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose was grinning widely as she squeezed Mahiru tight.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was relieved to see the way she was touching Mahiru didn't constitute sexual<p></p>
    <p></p>
    harassment, but he kept a sharp eye on Chitose to make it clear he wouldn't let her get<p></p>
    <p></p>
    away with anything.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm just joookiiing. I'm gonna give you the edible stuff, too, okay, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I have a feeling that edible and tasty are two very different things here…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane pressed a hand to his forehead. He could feel a headache coming on. Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was certainly excited about her latest plot. She didn't even try to hide her delight as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she laughed at Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm sure you'll enjoy your present!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    On Valentine's Day, as Amane had predicted, the mood at school was tense. Everyone<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was restless; no one could settle down. Many people believed that a guys' social status<p></p>
    <p></p>
    depended on whether he received chocolates on Valentine's Day. At the moment, most<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of the boys were trying to act like they weren't desperately waiting for something.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Everyone's all worked up, huh?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It certainly seemed nerve-racking. Amane, on the other hand, didn't care a bit about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his social standing, so he had the privilege of watching the day pass through the eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of a remote observer. His attention turned to Itsuki, who also had nothing to worry<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about today, though for a different reason.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Looks that way," Itsuki answered, staring nonchalantly across the classroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mr. Itsuki, as a man with a girlfriend—a man who, I might add, appears totally calm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    today—we'd like to ask for your opinion on this year's Valentine's Day proceedings."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, Amane, the boys certainly look desperate. Understandable, considering that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    whether they receive chocolates today can have major ramifications on their sense of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pride as men in the coming weeks. And let's not forget that approximately sixty percent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of these fine young fellows are, at this very moment, sweating over whether they<p></p>
    <p></p>
    might receive chocolates from the lovely lady Shiina."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Apparently, she's not giving anything to the guys, not even courtesy chocolate. Since<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it would get out of hand."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I guess it would… By the way, do you think you're getting anything from a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    certain someone?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No idea. At least, I haven't seen any indication that I might."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was giving chocolates to the girls but not the guys, so Amane didn't expect that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was going to give him any. Of course, he would feel grateful if she did give him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    some, but he was fine either way.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Honestly, as far as Amane was concerned, Valentine's Day was all just a big sales<p></p>
    <p></p>
    promotion cooked up by confectionery companies, so it wasn't something he really<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cared about.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki chuckled at his friend's obvious disinterest. "You sure are blunt, Amane." Then<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his attention turned to a particularly lively corner of the classroom. "Now, that… That's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    somethin', all right."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki was gesturing toward a handsome young man with a captivating smile<p></p>
    <p></p>
    surrounded by a group of girls all jostling to hand him different bags and boxes of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chocolates.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Class hadn't even started yet, and already the bag that the boy had apparently brought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expressly as a receptacle was stuffed full of presents, undeniable proof of his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tremendous popularity.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't know whether to say 'It figures' or what."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can just feel the hatred wafting off the other guys."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The boys shooting Yuuta envious looks or staring hopelessly into the distance likely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had not received anything from anyone yet. The difference between their social<p></p>
    <p></p>
    standings was obvious.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It must be a real pain to have to carry home so much chocolate, Amane told himself,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wondering what he would even do with that much candy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Popular guys have it rough, huh? What do you think he even does with it all?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, seriously. I'm amazed he doesn't get fat. It's been like this ever since middle<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school, but his figure hasn't changed at all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You can definitely tell he's a track-and-field guy. Well, at least that's a problem I won't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have to worry about."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Not so fast. Chitose really outdid herself this time. You'd better prepare yourself."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whaddaya mean 'prepare myself'?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's a Russian roulette."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Knock it off. What'd she mix in?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Their exchange the previous day heavily implied that Chitose wasn't planning to make<p></p>
    <p></p>
    normal sweets, but Itsuki made it sound like she'd used some incredibly questionable<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ingredients.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Let's see, one piece is a three-in-one habanero, wasabi, and hot pepper chocolate.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Another has pickled plum concentrate jelly in it. And the rest are normal chocolate."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What the hell has she created?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Apparently, she wanted to surprise you, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In a certain sense, he was surprised, but it was mostly in the about to faint sense.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Now I'm afraid to eat them."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Surrender all hope. I've already walked this thorny path."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I bet you ate them all for a laugh."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Maybe. As long as Chi makes it, I'll eat anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You two sicken me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki might put whatever Chitose offered him into his mouth without a second<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thought, but Amane wasn't so trusting.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose wasn't actually all that bad at cooking; the problem was that she always got<p></p>
    <p></p>
    carried away with her next grand idea. She was perfectly capable of preparing entirely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ordinary dishes; she just chose to create culinary calamities sometimes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    While her main victim was Itsuki, Amane was surprised to suddenly find himself in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the crosshairs. That said, from the way Itsuki was acting, he didn't think it could be<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too terrible. There was probably nothing to worry about, despite the agonized faces<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that Itsuki was making.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Still, Amane couldn't help but shake a strange feeling of melancholy.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay, Amane, here you go!" Chitose said, handing him his chocolates. She had caught<p></p>
    <p></p>
    up with Amane and Itsuki in their classroom after school.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you," Amane replied somewhat reluctantly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He didn't want to seem ungrateful, though he had to admit he was a little concerned<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about the chocolates she had made. He was still going to eat them all, obviously, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he wasn't looking forward to finding the super-spicy and super-sour chocolates she'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apparently hidden in the batch.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm sure you've heard from Itsuki, but be ready for something exciting!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I don't really like spicy food…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's not that bad, you wuss! I taste tested everything myself. In fact, I thought the hot<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one was actually really good!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, but you like spicy stuff…," Amane moaned. "Geez…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane didn't like spicy or sour food. It was like Chitose had gone out of her way to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    include flavors that Amane couldn't handle. On the other hand, the rest of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chocolates were sure to be really delicious, so…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, and there's also a super-sweet one and a super-bitter one mixed in."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Thanks for the warning…," Amane groaned. It was just like Chitose to add in a few<p></p>
    <p></p>
    extra land mines at the last minute.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The super-sweet one probably featured condensed milk, while the super-bitter one<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was probably made of close to 99 percent cacao chocolate. That actually didn't sound<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too bad. Amane handled bitter foods better than most.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, this was the first time Itsuki was hearing this, and his face twitched as he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    murmured, "Chi… you're unbelievable…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose continued smiling. "It'll be fine. There's even a special palate cleanser in there."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And what might that be?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, we're going now, bye-byeee." Without answering Amane's question, Chitose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grabbed Itsuki's hand and walked off. Apparently, they had a Valentine's date to get to.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good luck, man!" Itsuki offered as he was pulled away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane let out an exhausted sigh and waved good-bye. After watching them disappear<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from sight, he pulled on his coat, thinking it was about time for him to head home, too,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    and picked up his bag from the hook on the side of his desk.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane usually didn't mind being alone, but today he felt out of place among all the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    lovesick boys and girls. He shouldered his bag and glanced around the room.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The flurry of gift giving seemed to have finally subsided. Yuuta sat staring vacantly at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the enormous pile of presents on his desk. The other boys in the class could only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dream of such a hoard, and the bag hanging from the side of his desk was stuffed full<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of even more treasures.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could guess what was weighing on Yuuta's mind and couldn't help but feel bad<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for him. He approached the other boy's desk.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Kadowaki?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm? Ah, Fujimiya. What's up?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    They had been classmates for almost a year, so he remembered Amane's name, even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though Amane didn't have much of a presence in class.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had never taken the initiative to talk to Yuuta before, outside of a few group<p></p>
    <p></p>
    assignments, and the other boy seemed curious about the sudden interaction.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane responded to his confusion with an awkward smile, then undid the zipper of a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    small pocket on the front of his bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Nothing in particular, just, here—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    From the pocket, Amane pulled out several plastic supermarket bags, folded into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    compact triangles, and tossed them to Yuuta.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had put them there and told him, "Keep a few of these in your bag. That way<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you'll have them whenever you need them." He had imagined he might use them for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    garbage or maybe in case of motion sickness, but he'd never expected them to come<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in handy like this.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Looking perplexed by the strange bundles, Yuuta unfolded one of the triangles to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    reveal a relatively large disposable shopping bag. The plastic didn't look particularly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    durable, but Amane decided that Yuuta would just have to manage somehow.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did I… uh… read the situation wrong?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "N-no…," Yuuta replied. "You're right on target, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Great. Well, good luck with all that." Reflecting on the many hazards of popularity,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane waved good-bye and left the classroom.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Later, Yuuta was spotted around the school carrying several shopping bags stuffed to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bursting.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Though it was Valentine's Day, that didn't mean that there was anything special in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    air at home, and Amane went back to his apartment to relax just like always.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was too early to start making dinner, so he and Mahiru lounged beside each other<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the couch. She didn't seem excited or on edge in any way, and Amane took this as a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sign that she was definitely not planning anything special today.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He didn't mind, since he wasn't expecting anything in the first place, but couldn't quite<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dispel the slight disappointment that he chalked up to his manly pride.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "There was a sweet smell hanging over the school today, huh?" Amane remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It is Valentine's Day," Mahiru replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had heard a lot of disappointed grumbling coming from the boys in his class.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had only given chocolates to her female friends—she hadn't even handed out<p></p>
    <p></p>
    courtesy chocolates to the boys.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wondered why any of them had assumed they might receive anything in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    first place—it wasn't like they had any kind of relationship with her… but nevertheless,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    they had high hopes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, Valentine's Day really only matters to the popular guys anyway. It's got nothing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to do with lackluster guys like me…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How very perceptive of you," Mahiru remarked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not exactly proud to say this," Amane continued unprompted, "but I've never<p></p>
    <p></p>
    received a romantic gift from anyone. Though, I did just get some Russian roulette<p></p>
    <p></p>
    courtesy chocolates from Chitose."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Russian roulette courtesy chocolates?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Apparently, mixed in among the normal chocolates are some… exciting concoctions."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was impossible to tell the super-spicy, super-sour, super-sweet, and super-bitter<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chocolates from the rest, and any one of them seemed capable of obliterating his sense<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of taste. Amane was kind of afraid to start eating at all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Another amazing creation…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I'll eat them later, but please show some sympathy if you find me rolling around<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in agony."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're going to eat them all?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "The thing is… She sorta made them just for me, so I kinda feel obligated to eat them.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Besides, it's not like they're poisonous or anything."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The chocolates might be extra stimulating, but it wasn't like they would cause him any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    real harm, and Chitose had gone out of her way to make and deliver them, so he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    one hundred percent planning to eat them all with gratitude in his heart. Still, the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exciting ingredients made him rather nervous.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Is that how it is?" Mahiru muttered.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it's not like I got any other chocolates, and for a loner like me, Valentine's Day<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doesn't mean much besides an excuse to eat some candy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was perfectly content with a single courtesy gift. He was already worried about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the day one month from now when he would have to repay Chitose's present and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wondered what he should get her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru simply stared at him silently.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After dinner, Amane decided to sample one of Chitose's chocolates and ended up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    facedown on his desk in agony.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose had arranged evenly spaced partitions containing twelve truffles inside the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    box. There were four varieties of "surprise" chocolate. That meant he had a one-in-three<p></p>
    <p></p>
    chance of picking something that would give his taste buds the shock of a lifetime.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Among those, the worst was sure to be the super-spicy one. Amane figured that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    could handle the rest without too much trouble, but—<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You found one, didn't you?" Mahiru asked in a sympathetic tone. She had been in the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kitchen preparing drinks and returned to find Amane in obvious distress.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I was planning to eat them all over a few days, and this is what I get…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane quickly quaffed his drink, but the inside of his mouth was beyond hot. This<p></p>
    <p></p>
    went beyond having a low tolerance for spicy food—he was in real pain here. It wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    more than he could handle, but it was still pretty intense.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As the characteristically sharp sting of wasabi shot through his nose, Amane found<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself thinking how impressive it was that Chitose had managed to include so much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of the volatile component. He cursed her name while trying to hold back the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    instinctive tears.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The wasabi attacked his nose and eyes, while the habanero powder and hot pepper<p></p>
    <p></p>
    burned his tongue. A single nibble of these intense flavors—or rather, intense<p></p>
    <p></p>
    torments—was enough to ruin him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "My condolences," Mahiru said. "But think of it this way—if you make it through hell<p></p>
    <p></p>
    first, the rest will be heaven."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Easy for her to say. Amane was still in agony. He heard a soft sigh and then the sound<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of something hard being set down beside him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Here, this should help."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When he raised his head, there was a mug beside him, filled with a dark-brown liquid,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    giving off steam and a sweet aroma.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Cocoa?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Something like that. It's called chocolat chaud. It's French hot chocolate. I made it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    fairly sweet. It should help cleanse your palate."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm saved…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Right now, the only thing Amane wanted to do was to wash away this pain.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane tipped the contents of the mug into his mouth, a rich flavor enveloped his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    senses. The liquid had the luscious fragrance of full-bodied chocolate but was actually<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not that sweet. It tasted like dark chocolate and possessed a calming flavor that went<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down very easily.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's great."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm glad to hear it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane slowly sipped the hot chocolate, attempting to soothe the pain in his mouth.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The truffle hadn't actually contained very much of the spicy mixture. It had mostly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    been ganache coated in a thick layer of chocolate and covered in powdered sugar. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    weaponized sweet packed a big kick up front, but the impact faded as time went on.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    By the time Amane had drained his mug, he was left with only a slight tingle on his<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tongue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sigh… She really outdid herself…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Was it really that spicy?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, it had pepper and wasabi and habanero in it, so yeah. Damn… I'm glad you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    made that palate cleanser, but I think I would've died if I ate any more."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, I suppose there's no harm done."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Good grief."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even as he cursed Chitose's name under his breath, he knew that she had tried in her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    own way to surprise him, so he couldn't really be upset with her. All the chocolates<p></p>
    <p></p>
    besides the special four probably tasted normal, so it wasn't like there was any malice<p></p>
    <p></p>
    behind it. And she had even tried all the exotic ingredients herself. Amane could do<p></p>
    <p></p>
    nothing but smile bitterly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Anyway, the hot chocolate was a nice surprise. Usually you stick to hot milk, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yes, well…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Did you decide to make this because it's Valentine's Day?" Amane asked hopefully.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru basically always drank hot milk or milk tea, so the cocoa was unexpected.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Maybe."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, thank you. You're a lifesaver."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru responded with a small nod, and Amane breathed a quiet sigh of relief.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had gone out on a limb there, and if she had shot him down, he would have looked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like a real idiot. But apparently, he'd been right on the money. Mahiru had wanted to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    do something special for Valentine's Day after all. Amane was sure there wasn't any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    deeper meaning to it than that, but he was still grateful.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It was delicious," he said again.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru seemed uncomfortable.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Is something the matter?" he prodded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Um, well—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane knew that sitting beside her and pressing her for an answer would probably<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just make it harder for her to tell him, so he tried to be patient and listen instead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru hugged one of the pillows over half her face as she stared up at him anxiously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She looked like a small and strangely adorable animal, which made Amane want to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smile and reach out and pat her on the head. He continued waiting, but instead of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    continuing her thought, Mahiru simply trembled silently.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Then she stood up suddenly and grabbed her bags.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm… going home."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    By the time Amane let out a noise of surprise, Mahiru had already slipped out of the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    living room. He was frozen in place as he listened to the sound of her receding<p></p>
    <p></p>
    footsteps, then the front door opening and closing, and finally the sound of the lock<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turning. In a flash, Mahiru was gone.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He couldn't help letting out a confused noise at this quick work. "Eh…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Did I do something wrong…?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His heart was torn between surprise at her unexpected departure and worry that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had inadvertently driven her away. He stood up, thinking about what he should do if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was still in a bad mood when he saw her tomorrow, and went to check the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    front door. Suddenly, he caught sight of a light-pink paper bag hanging from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doorknob of his room. Mahiru must have left it there.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Inside the bag was a pastel-pink box tied with a chocolate-colored ribbon, and there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was a card affixed to the front with a sticker. The handwriting was smooth and neat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thank you for always being there for me. Please accept this with my gratitude.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane realized why she had left the bag there. Just handing it to him would have been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    too awkward, especially after she had decided not to give chocolate to any other boys.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She could have just given it to me…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Smiling gently at how surprisingly timid Mahiru could be in these sorts of situations,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane sat back down on the sofa and examined the contents of the bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The adorable wrapping paper reminded him of Mahiru's sophisticated yet feminine<p></p>
    <p></p>
    style.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane figured it was all right for him to go ahead and open it, and with some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    apprehension, he slowly unwrapped the box.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Inside were candied orange rings dipped in chocolate, each individually wrapped in<p></p>
    <p></p>
    plastic—in other words, orangettes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The contrast between the bright color and the deep luster of the chocolate was dazzling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to the eye, and the box even included a few with white chocolate coating, and some<p></p>
    <p></p>
    used lemon peels instead of oranges. They looked delicious, and Amane appreciated<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the variety.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There was a second card accompanying the Orangettes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    You don't seem to like sweet things too much, so I made you something that I thought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would better suit your tastes. I hope you like it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He recalled a conversation from about ten days earlier.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What kind do you like?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not really into sweet things, so… something not too sweet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, Mahiru had remembered his conversation with Chitose perfectly and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    picked something that would match his tastes. Amane suddenly felt very self-conscious.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hadn't expected to receive anything at all, and here she had selected something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    especially for him. It was typical of the sensitive, considerate Mahiru. Amane could feel<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself starting to blush just thinking about it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He reached down and picked up one of the orangettes, appreciating the beautiful<p></p>
    <p></p>
    colors as he unwrapped the candy and slowly took a bite. The sugary and astringent<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bite of the candied orange peel melded perfectly with the pleasantly bitter chocolate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in his mouth, each flavor complimenting the other in a splendid harmony.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …So good…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane marveled at how Mahiru's handmade confections were much better than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anything he'd ever gotten from the store as he took another bite.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's orangettes were a little sour, a little bitter—and intensely sweet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, Fujimiya, thanks for yesterday."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The following morning, Yuuta casually approached Amane at school. He seemed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cheerful and friendly, but Amane couldn't help but feel nervous talking to him. Even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though they had briefly spoken the day before, Amane never would have expected him<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to go out of his way to come say thanks just for that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    A few people shot them curious glances, which only made Amane even more nervous.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He didn't like being the center of attention.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, don't worry about it. You looked like you were having a hard time."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, yeah…" Yuuta got a faraway look in his eyes<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I bet being a popular guy is really tough, huh?" Amane tried to sympathize.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Yuuta was clearly aware of his popularity, but it wasn't the kind of thing he would ever<p></p>
    <p></p>
    flaunt. That was part of why everybody liked him—and why even the most jealous<p></p>
    <p></p>
    boys couldn't bring themselves to truly hate him. He was the kind of guy who would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    come over and thank you for something as trivial as a plastic bag.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Anyway, it was a big help. Just wanted to say thanks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't mention it. Glad I could help a guy in need."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He hadn't offered to help so that Yuuta would owe him or anything. Amane smiled to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    show that he thought it was no big deal, and Yuuta smiled back, looking relieved. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    girls in the class all squealed. Amane couldn't help but laugh bitterly as he wished that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Yuuta would save his smile for his admirers.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What did you do for Yuuta?" Itsuki asked after Yuuta left. Apparently, he had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    watching the exchange.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Kadowaki had too much chocolate, so I gave him a couple plastic bags."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah. So he ended up with more than he expected. Shoulda come prepared." Itsuki<p></p>
    <p></p>
    smiled sympathetically.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The two of them had watched Yuuta pile up the presents and agreed that he would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    probably have a hard time making it home with the whole score. Itsuki wasn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    surprised that Amane had decided to help out.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As far as Amane was concerned, it was really just a small gesture. Nothing worth going<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out of your way to say thank you for.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that's all it was. Nothing too important."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's just like you, man… But wait, you're keeping a bunch of old plastic bags<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around? Aren't you getting a little too engrossed in the domestic life? When I saw you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    scanning grocery store ads on your phone, I thought you were somebody's housewife."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, whose wife is that supposed to be? Last time I checked, I was still a man. Though,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'll admit that maybe I've been heavily influenced by you-know-who…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Without a doubt, he could say it was all Mahiru's fault. The two of them were splitting<p></p>
    <p></p>
    food expenses, so he had been checking online ads, thinking he had better get the best<p></p>
    <p></p>
    deals he could, then suggesting things they could make from whatever was on sale.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, that reminded Itsuki more of a housewife than a husband. Though he did<p></p>
    <p></p>
    leave the cooking entirely up to Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Must be nice to have a partner to play house."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She's not really my partner. And what about Chitose?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Chi? Well, sure. So long as I can keep her from getting carried away with her weird<p></p>
    <p></p>
    experiments anyway. I mean, she knows how to cook, for sure."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Does she ever make anything that's not weird?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's just part of her charm, all right?" Itsuki's eyes darted from side to side.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Whatever you need to tell yourself, man."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For better or worse, there was rarely a dull moment with Chitose. She might've looked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like an ordinary high school girl, and apparently she even had some surprising talents<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on the home front, but when the mood struck her, she was liable to cause all sorts of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    trouble.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, it sounds like she's going to get it together after we're married, so—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "How long do you think it's going to take to get your dad to accept her…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki's father, who was oddly strict about dating in a way that you didn't see much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    these days, had never approved of Chitose. He would definitely have something to say<p></p>
    <p></p>
    if he heard that they were planning to get married.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose's parents, on the other hand, were apparently ready to welcome Itsuki into<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the family at any time, which always confused Amane… Wasn't it usually the other way<p></p>
    <p></p>
    around?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, once we're adults, he'll have to come around. I'll threaten him with not seeing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his grandkids and all that. This is one fight where I can't back down and just do what<p></p>
    <p></p>
    my dad wants."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki made a show of shrugging like he didn't think much of it, but Amane noticed the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    serious look in his eyes. He was obviously not planning to budge on this issue.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had always understood the extent to which Itsuki loved Chitose, so he chose to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    encourage them, admiring how amazing it was that they were thinking about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    marriage even while they were still in high school.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, I think you're probably not one to back down until you've got a ring on her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    finger, so I wish you the best of luck."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah. And good luck to you, too," Itsuki replied.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "At what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean, with you-know-who… Right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I don't really have that kind of relationship with her. Don't make things up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane turned away sharply, but he could hear Itsuki's bright, cheerful laughter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane purchased everything he needed at the supermarket and headed home. When<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he got there, Mahiru was already in his apartment, sitting on the sofa, waiting in her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    usual spot. She had her knees pulled up and was squeezing a cushion to her chest. The<p></p>
    <p></p>
    position made her look a little childish, but her expression wasn't sulky or dour.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Rather, she looked embarrassed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Well, thank goodness she's wearing a long skirt, Amane thought as he carefully averted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his eyes and went to put the dinner ingredients away in the refrigerator. When he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    returned to the living room, Mahiru was still sitting there waiting for him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane sat down next to her, Mahiru carefully averted her eyes.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mahiru, thank you for the gift yesterday. It was really delicious."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm glad to hear it."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought that if she was nervous about what happened yesterday, the best thing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to do was to show her how much he appreciated it. Mahiru continued squeezing the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cushion but didn't say anything else.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What would you like in return?" Amane asked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not why I gave it to you…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I know that, but well, give a favor, get a favor, right? It wouldn't be very gentlemanly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    of me if all I do is take, take, take."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane believed that a man should always strive to pay back whatever he received.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Mahiru had gone out of her way to make him such delicious treats, he intended<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to give her something equally splendid in return. She hadn't made chocolates for any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    other boy, after all, yet she had made something special that she knew he would like.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It must have been a lot of work, all for his sake.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I already get so many things from you, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Actually, I'm pretty sure I'm the one who's been on the receiving end. You're always<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cooking for me and stuff. I always feel like I'm just taking advantage of you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I do those things because I like doing them. Amane, you probably don't even realize<p></p>
    <p></p>
    how much you've done for me. But as far as I'm concerned, I've already received more<p></p>
    <p></p>
    than enough, so I don't need anything else."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane genuinely could not imagine what he might have offered Mahiru. It seemed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like she was always doing things for him, and he wanted to pay her back for all her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    kindness… but the tally was apparently very different from Mahiru's perspective.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that is that, and this is this. I'll try to think of something you might like."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    No matter what Amane might have done for her until now, he still wanted to get her a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    White Day present. It was tradition to repay any Valentine's Day chocolates on White<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Day, after all.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane stared firmly at Mahiru, indicating that he had no intention of giving in on this,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    until she nodded, her eyes wandering around the room a bit.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Fine."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "All right, so I've got about a month to figure out what to give you. It would be great if<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I could find something that you would really like."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Do you have time for a search like that?" Mahiru asked, sounding slightly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    exasperated. "Next week we have final exams, and then right after, there's the closing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    ceremony."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sure enough, finals were only days away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There had still been a lingering aftertaste of Valentine's Day at school that day, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    soon it would be replaced with the typical prickly energy of pre-exam anxiety.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't particularly nervous about it, though.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If the exams go the same as usual," he said, "I'm sure I'll pass, so I'm not going to stress<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about them now. Same for you, I bet."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's true," Mahiru replied. "I make a point to get my work done with time to spare."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was always diligent when it came to keeping up with his classwork, so he rarely<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had any trouble with tests. He knew he could maintain his usual grades without any<p></p>
    <p></p>
    last-minute cram sessions. At most, he might spend a little extra time reviewing the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    material right before each test.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had actually already completed all the coursework in advance, and she was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    just as diligent about studying as Amane was, so he had never seen her panic about<p></p>
    <p></p>
    schoolwork. Instead, exam days with their shortened schedules were probably like<p></p>
    <p></p>
    half days for her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, don't expect too much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Okay. I'll treasure anything you give me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hey, don't get carried away now."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I've been taking very good care of Mr. Bear."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm glad to hear it." Amane smiled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Apparently, Mahiru really treasured the stuffed bear he had given her on her birthday.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had also seen her using the key holder, and she seemed to be taking good care of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that as well. He had worried a little bit about how the stuffed bear was faring, but…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    from all indications, Mahiru really liked it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could feel his mouth curling up into a grin when he heard Mahiru cutely refer<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to Mr. Bear, but he thought she might scowl at him if she caught him smiling, so he put<p></p>
    <p></p>
    on his best poker face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    If we're still hanging out when her next birthday rolls around, what sort of thing can I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    give her…? he wondered anxiously.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Suddenly, Amane noticed that Mahiru was staring at him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Come to think of it, I don't know when your birthday is," she said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Uh, mine? Mine is November eighth."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Guess I never told her, huh?<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When she heard his birthday, Mahiru's eyes narrowed… ever so slightly. They had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    spending a lot of time together for several months, so he had come to understand that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    expression as the one she made when she was angry or annoyed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Hey, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Didn't we already know each other by then?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, I guess so."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Why didn't you say anything?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Because you never asked. You didn't tell me your birthday, either, remember? I only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    knew because I saw it on your school ID."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Urk—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And we weren't that close back then anyway. If I had told you my birthday, you would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have wondered why in the world I was bringing it up."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Also, Amane hadn't wanted to come across like he was fishing for a present or<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anything. That would not have been a good look. So he hadn't seen the need to tell her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about his birthday—they hadn't had that kind of relationship back then.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…But—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really don't have to worry about it," Amane insisted.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Fine…," Mahiru said. "But we'll definitely celebrate your birthday properly this year."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As she said that, she turned to him and grasped his sleeve tightly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru obviously didn't want this unequal situation to continue. He had never seen<p></p>
    <p></p>
    someone so serious about a birthday before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane couldn't help but grin—not his normal, wry smirk, but an honest, happy smile.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    After all, nothing could make him happier than hearing that Mahiru felt the same way<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he did… and that she was thinking about spending time together in the future.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So you're planning to stay with me at least that long, are you?" he prodded.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's bright, caramel-colored eyes went wide—and then, in an instant, her face<p></p>
    <p></p>
    flushed red, and where she had been gripping his sleeve a moment ago, she whacked<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him with the cushion, obviously trying to hide her embarrassment. Amane could feel<p></p>
    <p></p>
    himself smiling again at how charming she was.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Well, I suppose I don't hate the thought… I always feel so calm when we're together.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It's nice."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh really? Thanks."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But you know I don't really… have any other intentions."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I knew that already." Amane nodded. "And that's fine with me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    For some reason, Mahiru looked slightly disappointed.<p></p>

    22 White Day<p></p>
    Amane was always diligent with his studies and serious about his lessons, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    completed his final exams without any particular difficulty.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Going over his tests with Mahiru, he found that he'd gotten the same grades as usual.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He always did well enough at school and never had to worry about being held back a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    grade or anything like that.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki also got fairly good scores, and even Chitose had apparently done well enough<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to avoid a failing mark, so the people Amane was closest to were in no danger of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    repeating a year, either.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    All that was left was the graduation ceremony to send off the third-year students, which<p></p>
    <p></p>
    didn't have much to do with them, and after that, to wait for the closing ceremony.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Between the two ceremonies, however, was one very important date.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…What do I give her?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The day was fast approaching for all those who had prevailed on Valentine's Day to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    repay their gifts. Both Mahiru and Chitose had given Amane chocolates, so naturally<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was planning to give them each something in return. The only problem was that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had no idea what to give Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Chitose's gift was easy enough—he planned to combine a White Day cake from the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    store where she had purchased their Christmas cake with a sundry of merchandise<p></p>
    <p></p>
    based on the characters she liked.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was sure that someone like Chitose, who was more interested in sweets than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sweethearts, would appreciate that. It was an obvious choice.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But Mahiru remained a dilemma.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was sure that Mahiru would graciously accept anything he got her—the thought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    mattered more to her than the actual gift. But he wanted to pick out something that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would make her really happy. The trouble was that he honestly didn't know much<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about the kinds of things she liked. He knew she had a taste for sweets and liked cute<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stuff like most other girls, but beyond that, he was lost. Mahiru was not an easy person<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to shop for.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane remembered her telling him that she wanted a new whetstone, but that didn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seem like a particularly charming gift, and he couldn't really afford something like that<p></p>
    <p></p>
    anyway. And for this occasion, it seemed more appropriate to give her something she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    would enjoy, rather than something practical.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane started his search by looking over the White Day display at a nearby department<p></p>
    <p></p>
    store, but he couldn't picture Mahiru being truly happy with any of the things there.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was hoping for a reaction like he'd gotten when he'd given her the stuffed bear.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Of course, it would be boring to give her a stuffed animal a second time.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    There were many adorable stuffed animals on display, but Amane decided that a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    repeat gift lacked originality.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    On the other hand, when he tried to imagine what would impress her, Amane's poor<p></p>
    <p></p>
    imagination could only come up with cosmetics or fashion accessories.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But he knew less than nothing about cosmetics, and he wasn't sure whether they had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the kind of relationship where he could confidently pick out fashionable things for her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He didn't think she would interpret it as anything strange, but he wasn't sure it would<p></p>
    <p></p>
    really impress her, either.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane thought that their relationship was pretty good, and if he were Itsuki and she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    were Chitose, an accessory would be an obvious choice, but Amane just didn't think it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    was the right move here.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Racked with worry, Amane lingered restlessly by the gifts corner. He imagined that he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    must look awfully suspicious. Even though he had taken the precaution of dressing up<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to go out, he thought that a single guy hanging around the cute goods had to seem<p></p>
    <p></p>
    shady.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He was grumbling to himself about his options, when from behind him a voice asked,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Are you looking for anything in particular?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane turned around, there was a young woman in a store apron standing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    there smiling. She had probably noticed his distress as he helplessly wandered the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    aisles.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, um… I'm not sure what to get for a White Day present."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So nothing in the display jumps out at you? Well, there are some things in our regular<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stock that are also popular White Day gifts. Let me show you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, no, that's not exactly it… You see, our relationship is rather hard to define, and I'm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not sure what I can get her that won't be… too much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Meaning what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, she's not my girlfriend, but we are pretty close, so… this is just an example, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I'm wondering whether she would be happy to get an accessory or something from a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    guy she doesn't like… that way."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    As Amane explained his predicament, the store clerk let a little giggle slip out. She<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed to find his dilemma quite charming.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I've seen a lot of gentlemen come through here with the same sort of worries."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So what did they end up doing?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "They were all worried, too, but most of them decided to buy something. If you're close<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to this girl, she'll probably appreciate anything you give her."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt relieved to hear someone else say that, though of course the prospect of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    picking an accessory for Mahiru was still fairly daunting.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She was very particular about her attire, and the bits and pieces he had seen her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wearing before had all been quite elegant. Amane had no confidence that he could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    select something that would meet the standards of such a sophisticated young woman.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sir, would you like me to show you some of the items in the corner over there that are<p></p>
    <p></p>
    popular with our female customers?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Yes, please," Amane said gratefully, straightening up a little.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And so you bought something?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane told Itsuki about his shopping trip, his friend looked at him and laughed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    pretty much the same way the clerk had the day before.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The two of them were eating lunch together in the cafeteria, and when the topic of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    White Day came up, Amane had spilled the beans.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Geez, keep it down!" Amane insisted. "Anyway, I was worried that giving her an<p></p>
    <p></p>
    accessory might weird her out, since we're not dating."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're such a coward! A man should have more nerve, more spirit! And anyway, I have<p></p>
    <p></p>
    a feeling that she'll be happy with anything as long as it comes from you, ya know?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I guess so, but…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was the kind of girl who would graciously accept any gift, but Amane wanted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to give her a present that she would genuinely enjoy and want to use, so he had been<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stressing out trying to choose something good.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So what did you end up buying?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…A rose-gold bracelet with a flower pattern."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had thought that the soft warmth of the rose gold would suit her better than coollooking silver or extravagant yellow gold. Of course, he was just in high school, so he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    couldn't afford real precious metals, so it was only gold-plated, but he had been careful<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to select a design that seemed to suit Mahiru's style.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Really? That seems like exactly the kind of thing she'll like, man."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…She won't be weirded out?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No way; you're worrying too much. Why are you always so negative about this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stuff…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She's the only girl I've ever seriously thought about giving a present to."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    His mother didn't count, and he wasn't thinking of Chitose, either. And anyway, he'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    only gotten Chitose a confection that he already knew she liked, so that present felt<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like it was on a different level.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really don't have any confidence with this stuff, huh…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And why should I? I mean… it's Mahiru!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "She was happy with the teddy bear, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, that's true, but—"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Amane, it's all about feeling, man, feeling. You've already spent the cash and chosen<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the gift, so all that's left now is to put some emotion behind it." Itsuki made it sound<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so simple.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If it was that easy," Amane grumbled, "I wouldn't have any problem." He pressed a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hand to his forehead.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It seemed he would be plagued with doubt over his decision until White Day.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When the fateful day arrived, Amane was waiting for Mahiru in his apartment, wearing<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an unusually nervous expression. The mood at school had reminded him of Valentine's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Day. The boys who had come out on top a month earlier were anxious about giving<p></p>
    <p></p>
    their return gifts, and the girls were waiting with barely contained anticipation.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Incidentally, Yuuta had faithfully returned each and every gift, repaying each one with<p></p>
    <p></p>
    an identical box of sweets. Amane's eyes glazed over when he considered that even<p></p>
    <p></p>
    doing the very minimum must have cost Yuuta tens of thousands of yen.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In any case, there was no way that Amane would have given Mahiru his present at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school, so now he waited for her to arrive at his apartment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had rushed home from school to compose himself, but try as he might, he was just<p></p>
    <p></p>
    not used to giving gifts. His nerves were threatening to get the better of him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Just this once, he wasn't wearing his usual sweatpants and T-shirt, but rather a layered<p></p>
    <p></p>
    outfit with a gray V-neck sweater over a white shirt, paired with chino pants. He'd<p></p>
    <p></p>
    tried to look a little less sloppy than usual, but he wasn't entirely sure how his new<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look would be received.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was still struggling to get ahold of himself when he heard the sound of the front<p></p>
    <p></p>
    door unlocking. He sat bolt upright, startled.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It was Mahiru, using her duplicate key, as usual. When she came into the living room,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she looked at Amane and froze.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, wh-why is your hair like that?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Well, uh, it is White Day, ya know, and I wanted to dress up a little, so I thought I had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    better try to clean up my act today… If you don't like it, I can go fix it, though."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He'd obviously succeeded in surprising Mahiru, and she didn't seem to be taking it too<p></p>
    <p></p>
    well—but when he stood up, she waved a hand in front of her face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Th-that's not what I meant. I was just surprised, is all."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I see."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could tell that something was up with Mahiru. He was starting to think he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    should have stuck to his usual getup.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru was fidgeting as she took a seat beside him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…You still look uncomfortable. Should I go change?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "N-no, it's fine, it's just… It's a lot."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What do you mean?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "W-well, you're always so low-key. I feel like I can relax around you. But… when you're<p></p>
    <p></p>
    all done up like that, it makes it hard to stay calm."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "In that case, I'll take it off."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru grasped his sleeve tightly. "…I said it's fine."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When she looked up at him with dewy eyes and flushed cheeks, Amane felt his heart<p></p>
    <p></p>
    leap in his chest. He knew she wasn't doing it on purpose, but she was really making<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it hard for him to maintain his composure. It didn't help that she was close enough<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that he could smell her sweet perfume.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane was incredibly aware of the way she was fidgeting restlessly and how tightly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    she was holding on to him. Now both of them were blushing, and it made the situation<p></p>
    <p></p>
    even more uncomfortable.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane's eyes darted restlessly around the room. "Well, uh, okay," he stammered. Then,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in an effort to move past the awkward moment, he gracelessly thrust a paper bag<p></p>
    <p></p>
    toward Mahiru. "Here. It's your gift. Don't expect too much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you. May I open it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Okay."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    It would be embarrassing for her to open it right in front of him, but he wasn't going<p></p>
    <p></p>
    to say no. Amane had purchased a small box lined with velvet to hold the bracelet, but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    now he worried that it was too much for the gift he'd chosen.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's slender white fingers gently opened the dark-blue box. Inside was the rose<p></p>
    <p></p>
    gold bracelet he had purchased the other day, as well as some folded paper he had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    included as a bonus.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru didn't seem to be into gaudy accessories, so he had emphasized elegance and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    simplicity when choosing the flower bracelet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Here and there it was decorated with sparkling glass crystals that caught the light and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    glittered. The design was both cute and refined.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's caramel-colored eyes gazed for a long time at the brilliance of the rose-gold<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bracelet in the box.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You don't like it…?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I think it's lovely."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's a relief. I picked that because I thought it would look good on you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you very much."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru's eyes were downcast, as though she was embarrassed by what he had said.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Watching her, Amane felt his breath catch in his throat.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…And this is?" Mahiru asked, noticing the paper he had included in the box.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wanted to look away, but he couldn't take his eyes off Mahiru.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ah, that?" Amane scratched his cheek in embarrassment. "Well, um, I kinda thought<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the bracelet wasn't enough somehow, so… You're always taking care of me, and um, I<p></p>
    <p></p>
    want to be able to grant any requests you might have, so…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The paper he had put in the box as a bonus gift was a booklet of I'll do anything you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    say tickets, like the kind a small child might make. The bunch of tickets was good for<p></p>
    <p></p>
    three uses and featured a hand-drawn illustration of a bear. Amane thought it had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    turned out rather well, given his skills anyway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since Mahiru was always looking after him, he wanted to do what he could to help her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    out whenever she might need it.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That was the idea behind the coupons anyway, but Mahiru seemed more focused on<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the illustrated bear. Her shoulders trembled with laughter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Pfft-ha-ha, did you draw this yourself, Amane?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh hush," Amane said sullenly. "I'm no artist. So what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "No, I think it's great. You chose it for a reason." Mahiru's innocent smile made it<p></p>
    <p></p>
    obvious that she hadn't really meant to criticize. "…So can I use them right away?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "On what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane hadn't expected her to want to exercise her privilege so suddenly, but if Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had a favor that she wanted to ask of him, he intended to grant her request to the very<p></p>
    <p></p>
    best of his ability.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru gently turned the box containing the bracelet around to face him. "…Amane,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    please help me put this on."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh, come on, you don't need a ticket to ask me that," he said with a troubled smile as<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he listened to her modest request. "Now, if the lady would allow me to assist…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru held out the box, and his expression softened when he saw how cute she<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked. After he took the box from her, he set it down on his knees and removed the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    bracelet, noting the smooth sound of the delicate chain sliding across the velvet.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Gingerly, he opened the clasp and gently wound the chain around her wrist. Finally, he<p></p>
    <p></p>
    carefully fastened it back together. The warm rose gold sparkled on Mahiru's delicate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wrist.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    I was right, this color does suit Mahiru's light skin.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Since hers was a refined sort of beauty, Amane had guessed that something<p></p>
    <p></p>
    conservative and elegant would suit her better than something flashy, and he felt a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    surge of pride when he realized that he had made the correct selection.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Yeah, that looks good."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Thank you."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Thinking it wouldn't do to hold on to her for too long, he let go of her hand, and Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    brought the arm bearing the bracelet up to her chest, holding it gently, and smiled<p></p>
    <p></p>
    softly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    That sweet, unabashed smile, the soft shape of Mahiru's lips, the slight flush on her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    innocent cheeks… It was both childish and womanly, guileless and refined. Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    found he couldn't turn away from her, no matter how hard he tried.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    …This is too much…<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Knowing that he was the reason for Mahiru's smile was almost more than he could<p></p>
    <p></p>
    stand. Amane tried to tear his eyes away and bring his soaring heart back down to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    earth, but in the end, he kept staring at her until she noticed and hid her face in a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    cushion.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "So how was White Day?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The following day Itsuki asked him for a report. Amane did his best to give him a<p></p>
    <p></p>
    humorless scowl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki had been considerate enough not to ask while they were in school, but on the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    way home, they stopped at a fast-food joint, and the moment they sat down, he began<p></p>
    <p></p>
    digging for details with a grin.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had only come to eat some fries because he was craving something salty.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Now he thought it probably would have been better not to come if he was going to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    have to put up with this kind of questioning.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "What's there to tell…? I just gave her the bracelet like normal."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "And was she happy to get it?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…More or less," Amane answered in the calmest voice he could muster.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    True, he hadn't gotten quite the reaction he'd been expecting, but judging by her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    earnest smile, he was sure she'd been happy with the gift.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane felt a little uncomfortable just recalling that sweet, beautiful smile. He tried to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    suppress the warmth creeping onto his face.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sure, sure." Itsuki folded his arms and nodded knowingly. "I can tell from your reaction<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that it went over really well. She was definitely happy to get the gift, and she smiled at<p></p>
    <p></p>
    you really cute-like, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I mean—" Amane bit his lip.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Look, man. You're building a solid connection, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Rather than teasing him, Itsuki was speaking earnestly and in a serious tone. Itsuki<p></p>
    <p></p>
    never intruded in certain areas that, as Amane's best friend, he knew better than to<p></p>
    <p></p>
    touch. But aside from those topics, he had an uncanny knack for pointing out the truth,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    so much that it was sometimes uncomfortable. Amane had no recourse—Itsuki's<p></p>
    <p></p>
    relationship was too well established to make good conversation material at this<p></p>
    <p></p>
    point, so changing the subject was near impossible.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane choked on his words, and Itsuki smiled at him calmly. The somewhat warm<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look in his eyes irritated Amane.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Seeing there was no use fighting back, Amane snatched a french fry and stubbornly<p></p>
    <p></p>
    looked away.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki smiled teasingly at his friend. "I'm happy for you, man. Finally, my little Amane<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is starting the springtime of his youth!"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "That's not what's happening."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "But you don't know for sure how she feels about it, right?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Even so, I'm sure it's not like that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Certainly, he knew from firsthand experience that Mahiru trusted him deeply. He<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wanted to be the person she trusted the most, in fact, and out of everyone she knew<p></p>
    <p></p>
    in school, he believed that she was the most honest with him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    But that didn't mean they were in love or anything.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Sure, sometimes when they touched, it felt a little… intense. But that wasn't uncommon<p></p>
    <p></p>
    with opposite-sex friendships. And okay, Mahiru did do a lot for him, but he was sure<p></p>
    <p></p>
    that didn't mean she had romantic feelings for him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    And yes, recently Amane had been spending a little more effort on his appearance. But<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he was still the same hopeless loser he'd always been. There was no way that a girl<p></p>
    <p></p>
    like Mahiru would fall for a guy like him.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You know, Amane, you can be pretty pathetic sometimes. Seriously, you're the kind of<p></p>
    <p></p>
    guy who acts like nobody will ever love him."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You really think that all it takes for a guy like me to get an amazing girlfriend is a little<p></p>
    <p></p>
    hard work? I'd have better luck waiting on a miracle…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "If all the beautiful girls were snapped up by only the most handsome, charming young<p></p>
    <p></p>
    men of the world, the guys who missed out might go down a violent path, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane wasn't sure Itsuki had a right to comment, as a member of the former group.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Itsuki continued, "Anyway, if you insist, we'll leave it at that for now… More importantly,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    it's time for me to make a prediction as your best friend."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "About what?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sooner or later, you're gonna change. I can already see the telltale signs. All that's left<p></p>
    <p></p>
    is for you to take the first steps toward your new future."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Don't talk like some kind of know-it-all guru," Amane said with a scowl.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Ha-ha-ha! How long have we been friends?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It hasn't even been a year," Amane quipped coolly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh yeah, that's right!" Itsuki roared with laughter.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    The two of them had only known each other since the start of high school, but Itsuki<p></p>
    <p></p>
    understood Amane much better than the guys he'd known in elementary and middle<p></p>
    <p></p>
    school back home. He was glad that the two of them got along so easily.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Anyway—," Itsuki continued.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Hmm?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You keep going on and on about how you're not worthy of her, but your attitude and<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the way you talk about her just proves that you actually do like her."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I will stick this french fry right up your nose," Amane threatened.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry," Itsuki instantly apologized.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane came very close to actually being impressed by what his friend had to say only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    for Itsuki to ruin it right at the end with a ridiculous comment.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're late today."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    When Amane returned home about an hour later than usual, Mahiru came out to greet<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him in her apron. After his earlier conversation with Itsuki, Amane couldn't help but<p></p>
    <p></p>
    think that she looked like a newlywed. He told himself that he didn't feel that way<p></p>
    <p></p>
    about her, so it wasn't fair to indulge in that delusion, and he drove the thought from<p></p>
    <p></p>
    his mind in a bit of a panic.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Mm, I had fries with Itsuki."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Right before dinner?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Don't worry, I'll finish my plate."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    He had a second stomach for Mahiru's cooking, and he had been conservative and only<p></p>
    <p></p>
    had a small order of fries anyway, so he had plenty of room for his meal, even if Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    dished up his usual serving size.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "For a second, I worried about you gaining weight…," Mahiru mused. "But you're so<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slim that you could probably stand to put on a little bit more meat."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "You're one to talk. I'm always worried you might snap in half one day."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I'm not that fragile, you know."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Oh really? Look at how thin you are."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru had a very slender and feminine physique. Of course, she did quite a few<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sports, so she wasn't just thin, she was also toned and flexible. Still, she had a delicate<p></p>
    <p></p>
    look to her for some reason, and just as a test, he reached out and grabbed her wrist,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    easily wrapping his fingers all the way around. He remembered his father warning<p></p>
    <p></p>
    him to always treat a lady gently and with care.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    She seemed so dainty and thin, he thought, as he moved his fingers along hers, feeling<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the delicate bones beneath her skin.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru squirmed uncomfortably. He saw she was staring at her hand in his, her cheeks<p></p>
    <p></p>
    slightly flushed, and realized much too late that he had been touching her without her<p></p>
    <p></p>
    permission.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    In a panic, Amane released Mahiru's hand.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Sorry. I should've known you wouldn't like that."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "It's… Well… I don't hate it when you touch me."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane stared at Mahiru in shock. He could barely believe his own ears. Mahiru also<p></p>
    <p></p>
    seemed to realize what exactly she had said and looked up suddenly, cheeks redder than<p></p>
    <p></p>
    he had ever seen them, eyes beginning to fill with tears. Amane felt like he couldn't<p></p>
    <p></p>
    possibly bear the embarrassment a moment longer.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Th-that doesn't mean that I'm asking you to touch me or anything, all right?" Mahiru<p></p>
    <p></p>
    explained. "Just that I hate it when other guys touch me. You understand?"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "Y-yeah," Amane said meekly.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    However, his heart was still pounding wildly. The very particular phrasing she had<p></p>
    <p></p>
    used left an awful lot open to interpretation. He felt like he needed to change the subject.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…Oh, um, I noticed…," he mumbled, "you're not wearing the bracelet I gave you<p></p>
    <p></p>
    yesterday. I mean, obviously you don't have to wear it if you don't want…"<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Mahiru looked down at her wrist and with one finger softly traced the place where<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane had grasped her.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…If I wear it when I'm doing housework, it gets in the way, and it'll get damaged<p></p>
    <p></p>
    sooner… I want to keep it nice, so I'll wear it on my days off."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I see."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could not imagine a more perfect answer. She had told him both that she was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    going to treasure the gift and that she was intending to wear it regularly. His legs<p></p>
    <p></p>
    threatened to give out on the spot, and his chest felt like it might burst with all the<p></p>
    <p></p>
    feelings bubbling up inside him, and in the heat of the moment, he was sure there<p></p>
    <p></p>
    wasn't a man alive who would have felt any different.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Somewhere in this dizzy state of mind, Amane realized how loudly his heart was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    thumping. He took several long, slow breaths to try to calm down.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…As long as you like it, I'm happy."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "I do, and I'm going to take good care of it. Like I do with all of them—the teddy bear,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    the key holder, and the bracelet. I'm going to use the hand cream without reservation,<p></p>
    <p></p>
    though." Mahiru smiled slightly, looking embarrassed.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Amane could not take it a moment longer. He quickly kicked off his shoes and darted<p></p>
    <p></p>
    down the hallway.<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "…I'm going to change clothes."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    "O-okay. See you when you get back, Amane."<p></p>
    <p></p>
    Even though he had come home to his own single apartment, Amane felt like he was<p></p>
    <p></p>
    being sent off by his new wife. His heart began to pound violently again, and he rushed<p></p>
    <p></p>
    into his bedroom and promptly collapsed on the floor.<p></p>
    <p></p>
