            <p>This is Gary.</p>
            <p>Gary likes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku">Hatsune Miku</a>.</p>
            <p>Gary created <a href="/vlog">this vlog</a>.</p>
            <p>However, he <a href="/images/slap.jpg"><i>doesn't really do vlogs now&hellip;</i></a>
            <br>(it's kinda a personal fad. It was sorta a one-off thing.)</p>
            <p>Gary loves his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaziland" target="_blank">country</a>.</p>
            <p>That is all.</p>
            <p><i>P.S.  He's kinda gay. It's in his name. Just don't tell him that.</i></p>
